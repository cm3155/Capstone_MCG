its assessment management considers the companys forecasted future results of operations estimates the content and apportionment of its income by legal entity over the near term for salt purposes and also applies longerterm growth rate assumptions based on its estimates management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize its dtas net of the valuation allowance at december however it is possible that some or all of the companys net operating loss and credit carryforwards could expire unused or that more net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be utilized than estimated either as a result of changes in future forecasted levels of taxable income or if future economic or market conditions or interest rates were to vary significantly from the companys

securities are evaluated for credit losses on a quarterly basis for the years ended december and gross unrealized losses on afs securities were million and million respectively the million increase is primarily due to the increased portfolio size from the merger with sterling and higher market rates because these unrealized losses were attributable to factors other than credit deterioration no acl

on a regular basis to assist with this process management inspects reports generated by the companys loan reporting systems related to loan production loan quality concentrations of credit loan delinquencies nonperforming loans and potential problem loans commercial nonmortgage assetbased equipment finance and warehouse lending loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrowers ability to operate and service its debt assessment of the borrowers management is a critical element of the underwriting process and credit decision once it has been determined that the borrowers management possesses sound ethics and a solid business acumen current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay obligations as contracted commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower warehouse lending loans are primarily made based on the borrowers ability to originate highquality firstmortgage residential loans that can be sold into the agency government or private jumbo markets and secondarily on the underlying cash flows of the borrower however the cash flows of borrowers may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans as applicable may fluctuate in value most commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principal balance warehouse lending loans are generally uncommitted facilities commercial real estate loans including multifamily are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to those for commercial nonmortgage assetbased equipment finance and warehouse lending loans these loans are primarily viewed as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate repayment of commercial real estate loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan the market in which the property is located and the tenants of the property securing the loan the properties securing the companys commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location which reduces the companys exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria all transactions are appraised to determine market value commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy management periodically utilizes thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio these policies and procedures coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized loan structures are spread across many different borrowers minimizing the level of credit risk trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis and policies and procedures are modified or developed as needed underwriting factors for residential mortgage and home equity loans include the borrowers fico score the loan amount relative to property value and the borrowers debttoincome level the bank originates both qualified mortgage and nonqualified mortgage loans as defined by applicable cfpb rules table of contents allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the acl on loans and leases increased million or from million at december to million at december primarily due to the initial acl of million and million recorded for pcd and nonpcd loans and leases respectively that were acquired from sterling in the merger as well as organic loan growth and commercial portfolio optimization initiatives the establishment of the initial acl for pcd loans and leases is net of million in chargeoffs which were recognized upon completion of the merger in accordance with gaap the following table summarizes the percentage allocation of the acl across the loans and leases categories table start at december in thousands amount amount commercial nonmortgage assetbased commercial real estate multifamily equipment financing warehouse lending residential home equity other consumer total acl on loans and leases table end the acl allocated to a single loan and lease category does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories methodology the companys acl on loans and leases is considered to be a critical accounting policy the acl on loans and leases is a contraasset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses that are expected to occur over the life of the asset executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the allowance which is maintained at a level that management deems to be sufficient to cover expected losses within the loan and lease portfolios the acl on loans and leases is determined using the cecl model whereby an expected lifetime credit loss is recognized at the origination or purchase of an asset including those acquired through a business combination which is then reassessed at each reporting date over the contractual life of the asset the calculation of expected credit losses includes consideration of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts generally expected credit losses are determined through a pooled collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics however if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches that of the collectively assessed pool it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses the total acl on loans and leases recorded by management represents the aggregated estimated credit loss determined through both the collective and individual assessments collectively assessed loans and leases collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on product type credit quality risk ratings andor collateral types within its commercial and consumer portfolios and expected losses are determined using a pd lgd and ead loss rate or discounted cash flow framework for portfolios using the pdlgdead framework credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting expected loss given the occurrence of a default and the expected exposure of a loan at default summing the product across loans over their lives yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio managements pd and lgd calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions historical loss information loanlevel risk attributes and credit quality indicators the calculation of ead follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of a similar segment within the same portfolio the calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses the loans amortization schedule and prepayment rates under the loss rate method expected credit losses are estimated using a loss rate that is multiplied by the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date for each loan segment identified above management applies an expected historical loss trend based on thirdparty loss estimates correlate them to observed economic metrics and reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions under the discounted cash flow method expected credit losses are determined by comparing the amortized cost of the asset at the balance sheet date to the present value of estimated future principal and interest payments expected to be collected over the remaining life of the asset the companys loss model generates cash flow projections at the loan level based on reasonable and supportable projections from which management estimates payment collections adjusted for curtailments recovery time pd and lgd table of contents the companys models incorporate a single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period the development of the reasonable and supportable forecast assumes each macroeconomic variable will revert to longterm expectations with reversion characteristics unique to specific economic indicators and forecasts reversion towards longterm expectations generally begins two to three years from the forecast start date and is complete within three to five years certain models use output reversion and revert to mean historical portfolio loss rates on a straightline basis in the third year of the forecast other models use input reversion and revert to the mean of macroeconomic variables in reasonable and supportable forecasts the company incorporates forecasts of macroeconomic variables in the determination of expected credit losses macroeconomic variables are selected for each class of financing receivable based on relevant factors such as asset type and the correlation of the variables to credit losses among others data from the forecast scenario of these variables is used as an input to the modeled loss calculation a portion of the collective acl is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics that are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses qualitative factors are based on managements judgement of the company market industry or business specific data including loan trends portfolio segment composition and loan rating or credit scores qualitative adjustments may be applied in relation to economic forecasts when relevant facts and circumstances are expected to impact credit losses particularly in times of significant volatility in economic activity individually assessed loans and leases if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches the risk characteristics of the collectively assessed pool it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses generally all nonaccrual loans tdrs and reasonably expected tdrs prior to january loans with a chargeoff and collateral dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty are individually assessed the measurement method used to calculate the expected credit loss on an individually assessed loan or lease is dependent on the type and whether the loan or lease is considered to be collateral dependent methods for collateral dependent loans are either based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell when the basis of repayment is the sale of collateral or the present value of the expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral for noncollateral dependent loans either a discounted cash flow method or other loss factor method is used any individually assessed loan or lease for which no specific valuation allowance is deemed necessary is either the result of sufficient cash flows or sufficient collateral coverage relative to the amortized cost of the asset additional information regarding the companys acl methodology can be found within note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data table of contents asset quality ratios the company manages asset quality using risk tolerance levels established through the companys underwriting standards servicing and management

data table of contents assetliability management and market risk an effective assetliability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both shortterm and longterm interest rate risk when determining the companys strategy and action to facilitate this process interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by the companys alco whose primary goal is to manage interest rate risk and maximize net income and net economic value over time in changing interest rate environments subject to limits approved by the board of directors limits for earnings at risk are set for parallel ramps in interest rates over a twelvemonth period of up and down and basis points and for interest rate curve twist shocks of up and down and basis points limits for net economic value referred to as equity at risk are set for parallel shocks in interest rates of up and down and basis points the alco also regularly reviews earnings at risk scenarios for nonparallel changes in interest rates as well as longerterm earnings at risk for up to four years in the future management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis and assetliability modeling software to calculate the companys earnings at risk and equity at risk key assumptions relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads prepayment speeds and the runoff of deposits from these simulations interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are formulated and implemented earnings at risk is defined as the change in net interest income due to changes in interest rates essentially interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion and the net interest income results in each scenario are compared to a flat rate base scenario the flat rate base scenario holds the end of period yield curve constant over a twelvemonth forecast horizon the earnings at risk simulation analysis incorporates assumptions about balance sheet changes ie product mix growth and loan and deposit pricing overall it is a measure of shortterm interest rate risk at december and the flat rate base scenario assumed a federal funds rate of and respectively the federal funds rate target range was at december and at december due to the federal funds target rate being at december the declining interest rate scenarios for both earnings at risk and equity at risk of down and basis points or more were not run per the alcos policy instead scenarios were run with shortterm and longterm interest rates declining to zero but not below since interest rates rose sharply throughout management has incorporated the down and basis point rate scenarios back into its assessment of interest rate risk at december as interest rates continue to rise scenarios that include upward and downward shifts of greater magnitude will also be incorporated equity at risk is defined as the change in the net economic value of financial assets and financial liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value equity at risk analyzes sensitivity in the present value of cash flows over the expected life of existing financial assets financial liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments it is a measure of the longterm interest rate risk to future earnings streams embedded in the current balance sheet asset sensitivity is defined as earnings or net economic value increasing when interest rates rise and decreasing when interest rates fall as compared to a base scenario in other words financial assets are more sensitive to changing interest rates than liabilities and therefore reprice faster likewise liability sensitivity is defined as earnings or net economic value decreasing when interest rates rise and increasing when interest rates fall as compared to a base scenario key assumptions underlying the present value of cash flows include the behavior of interest rates and spreads asset prepayment speeds and attrition rates on deposits cash flow projections from the model are compared to market expectations for similar collateral types and adjusted based on experience with the banks own portfolio the models valuation results are compared to observable market prices for similar instruments whenever possible the behavior of deposit and loan customers is studied using historical time series analysis to model future customer behavior under varying interest rate environments the equity at risk simulation process uses multiple interest rate paths generated by an arbitragefree trinomial lattice term structure model the base case rate scenario against which all others are compared currently uses the monthend liborswap yield curve as a starting point to derive forward rates for future months using interest rate swap option volatilities as inputs the model creates multiple rate paths for this scenario with forward rates as the mean in shock scenarios the starting yield curve is shocked up or down in a parallel fashion future rate paths are then constructed in a similar manner to the base case scenario cash flows for all financial instruments are generated using product specific prepayment models and account specific system data for properties such as maturity date amortization type coupon rate repricing frequency and repricing date the assetliability simulation software is enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation database financial instruments with explicit options ie caps floors puts and calls and implicit options ie prepayment and early withdrawal abilities require such modeling approach to quantify value and risk more accurately on the asset side risk is impacted the most by residential mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities which can typically prepay at any time without penalty and may have embedded caps and floors in the loan portfolio floors are a benefit to interest income in low interest rate environments floatingrate loans at floors pay a higher interest rate than a loan at a fully indexed rate without a floor as with a floor there is a limit on how low the interest rate can fall as market rates rise however the interest rate paid on these loans does not rise until the fully indexed rate rises through the contractual floor table of contents on the liability side there is a large concentration of customers with indeterminate maturity deposits who have options to add or withdraw funds from their accounts at any time implicit floors on deposits based on historical data are modeled the bank also has the option to change the interest rate paid on these deposits at any time four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk the size duration and credit risk of the investment portfolio the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio interest rate contracts and the pricing and structure of loans and deposits the alco meets frequently to make decisions on the investment and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook its interest rate expectations the risk position and other factors the alco delegates pricing and product design responsibilities to individuals and subcommittees but continuously monitors and influences their actions on a regular basis various interest rate contracts including futures options swaps caps and floors can be used to manage interest rate risk these contracts involve to varying degrees levels of credit and interest rate risk the notional amount of the derivative instrument or the amount from which interest and other payments are derived is not exchanged and therefore should not be used as a measure of credit risk in addition certain derivative instruments such as forward sales of mortgagebacked securities are used by the bank to manage the risk of loss associated with its mortgage banking activities generally prior to closing and funds disbursement an interestrate lock commitment is extended to the borrower during this time the bank is subject to the risk that market interest rates may change which could impact pricing on loan sales in an effort to mitigate this risk the bank establishes forward delivery sales commitments thereby setting the sales price the company will also hold futures options and forward foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the price volatility of certain financial assets and financial liabilities changes in the market value of these derivative positions are recognized in earnings additional information regarding derivatives can be found within note derivative financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data the following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of up and down and basis points might have on the companys net interest income over a twelvemonth period starting at december and as compared to actual net interest income and assuming no changes in interest rates table start 200bp 100bp 100bp 200bp december december na na table end asset sensitivity in terms of net interest income decreased at december as compared to at december primarily due to changes in the overall composition and size of the balance sheet on a combined basis postmerger with sterling and the relative size and duration of the securities portfolio loans at floors have decreased billion from billion at december to billion at december while loans with floors which are considered in the money have the impact of reducing overall asset sensitivity as interest rates rise these loans will move through their floors and reprice accordingly the following table summarizes the estimated impact that yield curve twists or immediate nonparallel changes in interest rates of up and down and basis points might have on the companys net interest income for the subsequent twelvemonth period starting at december and table start short end of the yield curve long end of the yield curve 100bp 50bp 50bp 100bp 100bp 50bp 50bp 100bp december december na na table end these nonparallel scenarios are modeled with the short end of the yield curve moving up or down and basis points while the long end of the yield curve remains unchanged and vice versa the short end of the yield curve is defined as terms less than eighteen months and the long end of the yield curve is defined as terms greater than eighteen months the results reflect the annualized impact of immediate interest rate changes sensitivity to the both the short end and the long end of the yield curve for net interest income generally decreased at december as compared to december primarily due to changes in the overall composition and size of the balance sheet on a combined basis postmerger with sterling as well as the relative size and duration of the securities portfolio and slower forecasted prepayment speeds as a result of increases in the yield curve which in turn extends the duration for mortgagebacked securities and residential mortgage loans table of contents the following table summarizes the estimated economic value of financial assets financial liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments and the corresponding estimated change in economic value if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points at december and table start book value estimated economic value estimated economic value change in thousands 100bp 100bp at december assets liabilities net net change as base net economic value at december assets na liabilities na net na net change as base net economic value na table end changes in economic value can best be described through duration which is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates for fixedrate financial instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time to receive future cash flows whereas for floatingrate financial instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time until the next rate reset overall the longer the duration the greater the price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates generally increases in interest rates reduce the economic value of fixedrate financial assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher interest rates in a rising interest rate environment the economic value of financial liabilities decreases for the same reason a reduction in the economic value of financial liabilities is a benefit to the company floatingrate financial instruments may have durations as short as one day and therefore may have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates duration gap represents the difference between the duration of financial assets and financial liabilities a duration gap at or near zero would imply that the balance sheet is matched and therefore would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for changes in interest rates at december and the companys duration gap was negative years and negative years respectively a negative duration gap implies that the duration of financial liabilities is longer than the duration of financial assets and therefore liabilities have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates at a slower pace consequently the companys net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise as the benefit of the decreased value of financial liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of financial assets the opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall over the long term absent the effects of any new business booked in the future at december longterm rates have risen by basis points as compared to december this higher starting point extends financial asset duration by decreasing residential mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities prepayment speeds these earnings and net economic value estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ and also assume that management does not take any additional action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates management believes that the companys interest rate risk position at december represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook management continues to monitor interest rates and other relevant factors given recent market volatility and is prepared to take additional action as necessary table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto in accordance with gaap and practices generally applicable to the financial services industry requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities while managements estimates are made based on historical experience current available information and other factors that are deemed to be relevant actual results could significantly differ from those estimates accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and can be susceptible to significant change in the near term critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with gaap that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations management has identified that the companys most critical accounting estimates are those related to the acl on loans and leases and business combinations accounting policies these accounting policies and their underlying estimates are discussed directly with the audit committee of the board of directors allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the acl on loans and leases is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense which represents managements best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses within the companys loan and lease portfolios at the balance sheet date the calculation of expected credit losses is determined using predictive methods and models that follow a pdlgdead loss rate or discounted cash flow framework and include consideration of past events current conditions macroeconomic variables ie unemployment gross domestic product property values and interest rate spreads and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts changes to the acl on loans and leases and therefore to the related provision for credit losses can materially affect financial results the determination of the appropriate level of acl on loans and leases inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends using existing qualitative and quantitative information and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions all of which may undergo frequent and material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers and macroeconomic variables that the company is more susceptible to unforeseen events such as natural disasters and pandemics along with new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problems loans the fair value of underlying collateral and other factors both within and outside the companys control may indicate the need for an increase or decrease in the acl on loans and leases it is difficult to estimate the sensitivity of how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall reserve because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the acl and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types further changes in factors and inputs may also be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the acl on loans and leases on a quarterly basis although the overall balance is determined based on specific portfolio segments and individually assessed assets the entire balance is available to absorb credit losses for any of the loan and lease portfolios additional information regarding the determination of the acl on loans and leases including the companys valuation methodology can be found in part ii under the section captioned allowance for credit losses on loans and leases contained elsewhere in this item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and within note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data business combinations the acquisition method of accounting generally requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the determination of fair value often involves the use of internal or thirdparty valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses or appraisals particularly the valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of loans and leases and the core deposit intangible asset acquired in the sterling merger include estimates related to discount rates credit risk and other relevant factors which are inherently subjective a description of the valuation methodologies used to estimate the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the sterling merger can be found within note mergers and acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item financial statements and
