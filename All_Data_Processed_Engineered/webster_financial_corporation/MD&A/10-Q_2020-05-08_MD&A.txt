the impacted policies are described within the recently adopted accounting standards updates section of this note certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation these reclassifications had an immaterial effect on the companys consolidated financial statements use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as income and expense during the reporting period economic and market assumptions are key factors in developing estimates declining economic activity and volatile market conditions related to the covid19 pandemic have impacted and may continue to impact accounting estimates actual results could differ significantly from assumptions previously used resulting in material changes for impacted accounting estimates in future periods operating results for the interim periods disclosed herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any future period recently adopted accounting standards updates effective january the following new accounting guidance was adopted by the company asu no reference rate reform topic facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting the update provides optional expedients and exceptions available to contracts hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform in addition to expedients for contract modifications the update allows for a onetime transfer or sale of heldtomaturity securities that reference an eligible rate the company will consider this onetime securities transfer along with other expedients available under the update as the company proceeds with reference rate reform activities for additional information on reference rate reform refer to the risk factors previously disclosed in websters annual report on form 10k for the year ended december the update became effective during the first quarter and applies to contract modifications and amendments made as of the beginning of the reporting period including the update issuance date march and applies through december the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements asu no codification improvements to topic financial instruments credit losses topic derivatives and hedging and topic financial instruments the update amends guidance on credit losses hedge accounting and recognition and measurement of financial instruments the changes provide clarifications and codification improvements in relation to recently issued accounting updates the amendments to the guidance on credit losses are considered in the paragraphs below related to our adoption of asu and has been adopted concurrently with those updates the company adopted the update during the first quarter on a prospective basis the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements asu no intangibles goodwill and other internaluse software subtopic customers accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract the update aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internaluse software the updated guidance also requires an entity to amortize the capitalized implementation costs as an expense over the term of the hosting arrangement and to present in the same income statement line item as the fees associated with the hosting arrangement the company adopted the update during the first quarter on a prospective basis to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements asu no fair value measurement topic disclosure framework changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement the update modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements the updated guidance no longer requires entities to disclose the amount and reasons for transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy however it requires public companies to disclose changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income oci for recurring level fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level measurements the company adopted the update during the first quarter on a prospective basis the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements asu no intangibles goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment the update simplifies quantitative goodwill impairment testing by requiring entities to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit up to but not exceeding the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit the update changes current guidance by eliminating the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis which involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination upon acquisition entities still have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary the company adopted the update during the first quarter on a prospective basis the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial statements asu no financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments and subsequent asus issued to clarify this topic the updates replace the existing incurred loss approach for recognizing credit losses with a new credit loss methodology known as the current expected credit loss cecl model the cecl methodology requires earlier recognition of credit losses using a lifetime credit loss measurement approach for financial assets carried at amortized cost the updates also revised the accounting for credit losses on availableforsale debt securities which is outside the scope of the cecl methodology the cecl accounting model applies to all assets measured at amortized cost including loans net investments in leases off balance sheet credit exposures and heldtomaturity debt securities cecl requires recognition of credit losses at purchase or origination using a lifetime credit loss measurement approach the allowance for credit losses is based on the composition characteristics and credit quality of the loan and securities portfolios as of the reporting date and includes consideration of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts at that date the cecl methodology also requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to determine the allowance for credit losses including economic forecasts allowance for credit losses on loans and leases under cecl the company determines its allowance for credit losses on loans and leases collectively using pools of assets with similar risk characteristics loans that no longer match the risk profile of the pool are individually assessed for credit losses collective assessments are performed based on two portfolio segments commercial loans and leases and consumer loans expected losses within the commercial and consumer portfolios are collectively assessed using pdlgd models based on the portfolio or class of financing receivable the companys lifetime credit loss models are based on historical data and incorporate forecasts of macroeconomic variables expected prepayments and recoveries outside of the model noneconomic qualitative factors are applied to further refine the expected loss calculation for each portfolio a two year reasonable and supportable forecast period is currently used for all loan and lease portfolios the expected loss models revert to historical loss rates on a linear basis over a one year period when the risk characteristics of a loan no longer match the characteristics of the collective pool the loan is removed from the pool and individually assessed for credit losses generally all nonaccrual loans tdrs potential tdrs loans with a chargeoff and collateral dependent loans are individually assessed the individual assessment for credit impairment is generally based on a discounted cash flow approach unless the asset is collateral dependent a loan is considered collateral dependent when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty collateral dependent loans are individually assessed and the expected credit loss is based on the fair value of the collateral the fair value is reduced for estimated costs to sell if the value of the collateral is expected to be realized through sale the company has elected to present accrued interest receivable separately from the amortized cost basis on the balance sheet and is not estimating an allowance for credit loss on accrued interest this election applies to loans and leases as well as debt securities the companys nonaccrual policies have not changed as a result of adopting the updates allowance for credit losses on investment securities heldtomaturity heldtomaturity debt securities follow the cecl accounting model expected losses are calculated on a pooled basis using statistical models which include forecasted scenarios of future economic conditions the forecasts revert to longrun loss rates implicitly through the economic scenario generally over three years if the risk of an heldtomaturity debt security no longer matches the collective assessment pool it is removed and individually assessed for credit deterioration a zero credit loss assumption is maintained for us treasuries and agencybacked securities in both the heldtomaturity and availableforsale portfolios the zero loss assumption is reconsidered on a quarterly basis to ensure it is still appropriate securities are placed on nonaccrual status when collection of principal and interest in accordance with contractual terms is doubtful generally when principal or interest payments become days delinquent unless the security is well secured and in process of collection or sooner if management concludes circumstances indicate that the borrower may be unable to meet contractual principal or interest payments allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments accounting for unfunded loan commitments also follows the cecl model with an allowance recorded on commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable by the company the calculation of the allowance includes the probability of funding to occur and a corresponding estimate of expected lifetime credit losses on amounts assumed to be funded the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and the related credit expense is recorded in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income accounting for availableforsale debt securities the updates revised the accounting for availableforsale debt securities by eliminating the otherthantemporary impairment model and requiring credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than a direct writedown of availableforsale debt securities under certain circumstances availableforsale debt securities continue to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in oci when the fair value of an availableforsale debt security falls below the amortized cost basis it is evaluated to determine if any of the decline in value is attributable to credit loss decreases in fair value attributable to credit loss are recorded directly to earnings with a corresponding allowance for credit losses limited to the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis if the credit quality subsequently improves the allowance is reversed up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit losses availableforsale debt securities follow the same nonaccrual policy as heldtomaturity debt securities when the company intends to sell an impaired availableforsale debt security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security prior to recovering the amortized cost basis the entire fair value adjustment will immediately be recognized in earnings with no corresponding allowance for credit losses impact of adoption the company adopted the updates during the first quarter using the modified retrospective method upon adoption the company recorded an increase in its allowance for credit losses as a cumulative effect adjustment this adjustment net of tax reduced the companys beginning total shareholders equity at january upon adoption the companys allowance for credit losses reflected all credit losses expected over the lifetime of the companys financial assets held at amortized cost the total increase in allowance and corresponding decrease in equity did not have a material impact to the companys regulatory capital amounts and ratios periods prior to january are reported in accordance with previously applicable gaap the impact of the january adoption entry is summarized in the table below december january in thousands preasc adoption impact of adoption reported under asc

adopted the following new accounting guidance applicable to the company has been issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb but is pending adoption asu no income taxes topic simplifying the accounting for income taxes the update provides simplification to the accounting for income taxes related to a variety of topics and makes minor codification improvements changes include a requirement that the effects of an enacted change in tax law be reflected in the computation of the annual effective tax rate in the first interim period that includes the enactment date of the new legislation the update will be effective for the company on january the company does not expect this update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements asu no compensationretirement benefits defined benefit plan general subtopic disclosure framework changes to the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans the update modifies disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans the update will be effective for the company on january the company does not expect this update to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements loan modifications under the cares act and interagency statement the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act section and the revised interagency statement on loan modifications and reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the coronavirus on march the cares act which provides relief from certain requirements under gaap was signed into law section of the cares act gives entities temporary relief from the accounting and disclosure requirements for troubled debt restructurings tdrs under asc in certain situations in addition on april certain regulatory banking agencies issued an interagency statement that offers practical expedients for evaluating whether loan modifications in response to the covid19 pandemic are tdrs the interagency statement was originally issued on march but was revised to address the relationship between their original tdr guidance and the guidance in section of the cares act to qualify for tdr accounting and disclosure relief under the cares act the applicable loan must not have been more than days past due as of december and the modification must be executed during the period beginning on march and ending on the earlier of december or the date that is days after the termination date of the national emergency declared by the president on march under the national emergencies act related to the outbreak of covid19 the cares act applies to modifications made as a result of covid19 including forbearance agreements interest rate modifications repayment plans and other arrangements to defer or delay payment of principal or interest the interagency statement does not require the modification to be completed within a certain time period if it is related to covid19 and the loan was not more than days past due as of the date of the companys implementation of its modification programs moreover the interagency statement applies to shortterm modifications including payment deferrals fee waivers extensions of repayment terms or other insignificant payment delays as a result of covid19 the company will apply section of the cares act and the interagency statement in connection with applicable modifications for modifications that qualify under either the cares act or the interagency statement tdr accounting and reporting is suspended through the period of the modification however the company will continue to apply its existing nonaccrual policies including consideration of the loans past due status which is determined on the basis of the contractual terms of the loan once a loan has been contractually modified the past due status is generally based on the updated terms including payment deferrals note variable interest entities the company has an investment interest in the following entities that meet the definition of a variable interest entity vie consolidated rabbi trust the company established a rabbi trust to meet the obligations due under its deferred compensation plan for directors and officers and to mitigate the expense volatility of the aforementioned plan the funding of the rabbi trust and the discontinuation of the deferred compensation plan for directors and officers occurred during invested assets in the rabbi trust primarily consist of mutual funds that invest in equity and fixed income securities the company is considered the primary beneficiary of the rabbi trust as it has the power to direct the activities of the rabbi trust that significantly affect the vies economic performance and it has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie the company consolidates the invested assets of the trust along with the total deferred compensation obligations and includes them in accrued interest receivable and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities respectively on the consolidated balance sheet earnings in the rabbi trust including appreciation or depreciation are reflected as other noninterest income and changes in the corresponding liability are reflected as compensation and benefits in the consolidated income statement refer to note fair value measurements for additional information nonconsolidated tax credit finance investments the company makes nonmarketable equity investments in entities that finance affordable housing and other community development projects and provide a return primarily through the realization of tax benefits in most instances the investments require the funding of capital commitments in the future while the companys investment in an entity may exceed of its outstanding equity interests the entity is not consolidated as webster is not involved in its management for these investments the company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vies the company applies the proportional amortization method to account for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects at march and december the aggregate carrying value of the companys tax creditfinance investments was million and million respectively which represents the companys maximum exposure to loss at both march and december unfunded commitments have been recognized totaling million and are

included in longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet and the related interest expense is reported as interest expense on longterm debt in the consolidated income statement other nonmarketable investments the company invests in various alternative investments in which it holds a variable interest these investments are nonpublic entities which cannot be redeemed since the companys investment is distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated for these investments the company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most

system has not changed with the adoption of cecl the credit risk grade system assigns a rating to each borrower and to the facility which together form a composite credit risk profile the credit risk grade system categorizes borrowers by common financial characteristics that measure the credit strength of borrowers and facilities by common structural characteristics the composite credit risk profile has ten grades with each grade corresponding to a progressively greater risk of loss grades are considered pass ratings and are considered criticized as defined by the regulatory agencies risk ratings assigned to differentiate risk within the portfolio are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in a borrowers current financial position and outlook risk profile and the related collateral and structural position loan officers review updated financial information on at least an annual basis for all pass rated loans to assess the accuracy of the risk grade criticized loans undergo more frequent reviews and enhanced monitoring a special mention credit has the potential weakness that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset a substandard asset has a welldefined weakness that jeopardizes the full repayment of the debt an asset rated doubtful has all of the same weaknesses as a substandard credit with the added characteristic that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full given current facts conditions and values improbable assets classified as loss in accordance with regulatory guidelines are

measurements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is best determined using quoted market prices however in many instances quoted market prices are not available in such instances fair values are determined using appropriate valuation techniques various assumptions and observable inputs must be relied upon in applying these techniques accordingly categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement as such the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate transfer of the respective asset or liability fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument these estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings or any part of a particular financial instrument fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience current economic conditions risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors these factors are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates fair value hierarchy the three levels within the fair value hierarchy are as follows level valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level fair value is calculated using significant inputs other than quoted market prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability the valuation may rely on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates rate volatility prepayment speeds credit ratings or inputs that are derived principally or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means level inputs for determining the fair value of the respective assets or liabilities are not observable level valuations are reliant upon pricing models and techniques that require significant management judgment or estimation assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis availableforsale investment securities when quoted prices are available in an active market the company classifies availableforsale investment securities within level of the valuation hierarchy us treasury bills are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy when quoted market prices are not available the company employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value such fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes market spreads cash flows yield curves live trading levels trade execution

established process to challenge their valuations or methodologies that appear unusual or unexpected availableforsale investment securities which include agency cmo agency mbs agency cmbs cmbs clo and corporate debt are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy derivative instruments foreign exchange contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and classified within level of the fair value hierarchy all other derivative instruments are valued using thirdparty valuation software which considers the present value of cash flows discounted using observable forward rate assumptions the resulting fair value is validated against valuations performed by independent third parties and are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy webster evaluates the credit risk of its counterparties to determine if any fair value adjustment related to credit risk may be required by considering factors such as the likelihood of default by the counterparty its net exposure remaining contractual life as well as the collateral securing the position the change in value of derivative assets and liabilities attributable to credit risk was not significant during the reported periods mortgage banking derivatives forward sales of mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities are utilized by the company in its efforts to manage risk of loss associated with its mortgage loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale prior to closing and funding certain singlefamily residential mortgage loans an interest rate lock commitment is generally extended to the borrower during the period from commitment date to closing date the company is subject to the risk that market rates of interest may change if market rates rise investors generally will pay less to purchase such loans resulting in a reduction in the gain on sale of the loans or possibly a loss in an effort to mitigate such risk forward delivery sales commitments are established under which the company agrees to deliver whole mortgage loans to various investors or issue mortgagebacked securities the fair value of mortgage banking derivatives is determined based on current market prices for similar assets in the secondary market and therefore classified within level of the fair value hierarchy originated loans held for sale residential mortgage loans typically are classified as held for sale upon origination based on managements intent to sell such loans the company generally records residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option of accounting standards codification asc topic financial instruments electing to measure originated loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of the derivatives used as an economic hedge on these assets the fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale is based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold

classified within level on the occasion that these loans should include adjustments for changes in loan characteristics using unobservable inputs the loans would be classified within level collateral dependent loans and leases loans and leases for which the payment is expected to be provided solely by the value of the underlying collateral are considered collateral dependent and are valued based

that represent its primary businesses commercial banking hsa bank and community banking these segments reflect how executive management responsibilities are assigned the type of customer served how products and services are provided and how discrete financial information is currently evaluated certain corporate treasury activities along with the amounts required to reconcile profitability metrics to amounts reported in accordance with gaap are included in the corporate and reconciling category description of segment reporting methodology webster uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by operating segment which is based on a series of management estimates for funds transfer pricing and allocations for noninterest expense provision for credit losses income taxes and equity capital these estimates and allocations certain of which are subjective in nature are periodically reviewed and refined changes in estimates and allocations that affect the reported results of any operating segment do not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of webster as a whole the full profitability measurement reports which are prepared for each operating segment reflect nongaap reporting methodologies the differences between full profitability and gaap results are reconciled in the corporate and reconciling category webster allocates interest income and interest expense to each business while any mismatch associated with the matched maturity funding concept called funds transfer pricing ftp is absorbed in corporate treasury activities the allocation process considers the specific interest rate risk and liquidity risk of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities in each line of business the matched maturity funding concept considers the origination date and the earlier of the maturity date or the repricing date of a financial instrument to assign a ftp rate for loans and deposits originated each day loans are assigned an ftp rate for funds used and deposits are assigned an ftp rate for funds provided beginning in webster refined the ftp calculation to reflect the allocation of capital credit to net interest income to better align segment results with key measurements used to review segment performance prior period net interest income and income tax expense were revised to reflect this change webster allocates a majority of noninterest expense to each reportable segment using a fullabsorption costing process costs including corporate overhead are analyzed pooled by process and
