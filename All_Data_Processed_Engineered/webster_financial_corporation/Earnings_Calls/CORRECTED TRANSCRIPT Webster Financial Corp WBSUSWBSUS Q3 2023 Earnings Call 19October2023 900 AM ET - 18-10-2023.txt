greater detail the results we announced today further illustrate the power of webster in terms of earnings potential as well as our sound operating and risk profile we continue to enhance our liquidity position and in contrast to broader industry trends we grew deposits by billion we also grew our net interest income and materially expanded net interest margin in the quarter in the quarter we also completed our core systems conversion marking a significant milestone in our integration and we are pleased with the outcome and did so with limited client disruption our streamlined technology architecture will allow us to further enhance client experience and more efficiently deliver for our clients in the future achieving this outcome took an exceptional effort on the part of our colleagues particularly our client facing colleagues and those dedicated to the conversion i want to express the gratitude of our executive team directors and shareholders for their efforts with the core conversion complete we expect our companys financial potential will become even more evident over the near to mediumterm and we will have significantly more opportunity to build upon our operating capabilities going forward including services that allow us to enhance noninterest income in our commercial consumer and hsa businesses furthermore our colleagues will direct their full attention to continuing to grow the organization as they deepen existing and develop new client relationships enhance our product capabilities and client service raise websters market profile and keep operations running smoothly with that as an introduction ill get into our financial highlights for the quarter ill start on slide on an adjusted basis we generated eps of with solid results across nearly all of our income statement lines and ppnr grew from the prior quarter this generated an adjusted return on assets of nearly and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of our efficiency ratio remained at among the best in the industry we grew our deposits by almost over prior quarter and we were able to grow net interest income despite a decline in loans as we have discussed in our prior calls and at our investor day in march weve continued to evaluate our capital allocation and the risk return dynamics across lending businesses since our merger closed nearly two years ago weve discussed with many of you that the time would come to deemphasize some businesses where our resources and capital could be better allocated and we are starting to see some of that today particularly in an environment where liquidity is at a premium and the credit environment remains uncertain in the quarter we focused our loan origination efforts on franchise building full relationships ci and nonoffice commercial real estate we purposely deemphasized our mortgage warehouse activities where balances materially declined as a result of our deposit growth and more targeted loan origination activities our loan to deposit ratio improved providing us a ton of flexibility as we move forward we have a solid loan pipeline and feel good about our ability to continue to safely grow earning assets even with the backdrop of sluggish loan demand our common equity tier ratio and tce ratio are strong at and respectively our robust capital position and returns provide us a great deal of flexibility and optionality in terms of capital deployment whether it be organic growth share repurchases payment on our common dividends webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 or in selective instances executing on complementary acquisitions such as the interlink and bend transactions that weve executed on over the last two years on slide we again provide a profile of our diverse and unique deposit funding many of you have seen this slide a few times now but we like to highlight what we believe to be one of our key competitive advantages particularly as deposits exit the banking system the deposit growth we generated this quarter was a team effort with most of these channels contributing and glenn will provide more details on our deposit growth shortly this business profile also enables our robust liquidity position which we review on the following slide slide we again increased our immediately available liquidity to billion from billion last quarter in the most recent quarter our uninsured deposits fell to of total from last quarter and our liquidity coverage of those uninsured deposits grew to versus last quarter ill touch on our office cre portfolio and credit in general as we turn to slide office loan exposure continues to be a focus of our conversations with investors and we continue to actively manage our risk in that asset class notably weve proactively reduced our office exposure which is now under billion or of loans including actions taken this quarter weve reduced the portfolio by million since the second quarter of or of the original balance the portfolio is generally well secured with an at origination weighted average ltv of and a current debt service coverage ratio of times no delinquencies in the portfolio and a low level of non accruing assets note that of the remaining portfolio almost twothirds of our exposure has some level of tertiary support in the form of a guarantee or reserve overall while its clear that the credit environment remains uncertain and that the industry trends indicate some level of bumpiness as we move forward we remain generally pleased with the resilience and credit metrics in our existing loan portfolio while our commercial classifieds increased in the quarter they remained well below prepandemic levels our nonperforming loans and chargeoffs remain stable and at historically favorable levels we continue to add to our overall allowance for credit losses and our coverage of loans and leases compares favorably to peers we continue to proactively manage credit exposure in our portfolio to ensure early identification of problem credits ill now turn it over to glenn to provide more details on the quarter glenn i macinnes chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thanks john and good morning everyone ill start on slide with our gaap and adjusted earnings we reported gaap net income to common shareholders of million with earnings per share of on an adjusted basis we reported net income to common shareholders of million an eps of excluding million in pretax mergerrelated expense mergerrelated charges were associated with our core conversion which was completed in the third quarter and will decline significantly in the fourth quarter next i will review our balance sheet trends beginning on slide total assets were billion at periodend down million from the second quarter interestbearing deposits primarily cash held at the fed was billion at periodend we averaged billion in cash for the quarter in line with what we anticipate going forward our security balances were relatively flat in the quarter as we reinvested proceeds from maturities and sales loans were down billion reflective of both lower loan demand and a decline in nonstrategic loan categories webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 deposits grew billion in the quarter and we reduced borrowings by billion deposit growth was across several product types and business lines including over million in noninterestbearing deposit growth our loantodeposit ratio was in the quarter down from last quarter and we anticipate operating in the mid going forward our capital levels are consistently strong the common equity tier ratio was and our tangible common equity ratio was tangible book value decreased to per share reflecting the impact of aoci the dividend a small share repurchase this was partially offset by retained earnings unrealized security losses included in tangible book value increased to million after tax from million last quarter driven by higher rates in a steady interest rate environment we anticipate roughly million of this would accrete back into capital annually loan trends are highlighted on slide in total loans were down by billion or on a linkedquarter basis the commercial bank continues to drive loan trends where declines were reflective of both lower demand and declines in nonstrategic categories mortgage warehouse was down million commercial real estate was down million as we continue to reduce our office exposure and ci was lower by million the yield on the loan portfolio increased basis points and floating and periodic loans were of total loans at quarter end we provide additional detail on deposits on slide the total deposits of billion from prior quarter were we saw growth in all major deposit categories with the exception of savings growth was aided by the seasonal inflow in public funds along with growth in interlink commercial and hsa in our commercial business we continue to recapture balances that have left in search of diversity earlier this year as well as new clients our total deposit costs were up basis points to basis points for cumulative cycletodate total deposit beta of on slide we have updated the forward progression of our deposit beta assumptions we anticipate our cycle todate beta will reach in the fourth quarter of this year while the macro data has pushed out the interest rate cycle we would still anticipate a beta in the low to mid by the middle of our expectations here aligned with our outlook for which we assume no further fed increases at this point with cuts beginning at the back half of moving to slide we highlight our reported to adjusted income statement compared to our adjusted earnings for the prior period overall adjusted net income was up million over prior quarter net interest income was up million as we continue to benefit from our asset sensitive balance sheet adjusted noninterest income was flat while expenses were down million we also benefited from a lower tax rate this quarter down from in the second quarter partially offsetting these trends the provision was up million the net interest margin was up basis points from the prior quarter the nim benefited from more normalized on balance sheet liquidity as well as our asset sensitive position and our efficiency ratio was on slide we highlight net interest income which grew million linked quarter net interest margin increased basis points from the prior quarter our yield on earning assets increased basis points from the prior quarter and the pace of deposit pricing moderated to basis points its important to note that our total cost of funds were up just basis points as growth in core deposit categories was used to replace wholesale funding and brokered cds webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 on slide we highlight our noninterest income which was flat to prior quarter an increase in derivative valuation and direct investment gains was offset by declines in deposit service fees transaction activity tied to commercial clients remain slow in the third quarter though the outlook is improving into next year the yearover year decrease was primarily driven by million in lower client deposit fees million lower loan related fees million from the outsourcing of the consumer investment service sic consumer investment services platform and lower client hedging activity noninterest expenses on slide we reported adjusted expenses of million down million from the prior quarter reductions in professional fees occupancy and marketing were partially offset by higher employee benefits and technology expense slide details components of our allowance for credit losses which were up million over prior quarter after recording million in net chargeoffs we incurred a million provision expense for macro and credit factors partially offset by the impact of lower loan balances as a result our allowance coverage to loans increased to basis points from basis points last quarter slide highlights our key asset quality metrics on the upper left nonperforming assets are flat to prior quarter and prior year with nonperforming loans representing just of loans basis points of loans commercial classified loans as a percent of commercial loans increased to basis points from basis points as classified loans increased by million on an absolute basis the balance was up as we saw migration of a few larger credits that we expect to cure over time net chargeoffs in the upper right totaled million or basis points of average loans on an annualized basis we divested another million in office loans in the quarter these divestitures generated million of the million in net chargeoffs worth repeating our total office exposure declined million inclusive of other actions this quarter on slide we maintained strong capital levels all capital levels remain in excess of regulatory and internal targets our common equity tier ratio was and our tangible common equity ratio was our tangible book value was a share including the afs mark on our securities portfolio our common equity tier ratio would be approximately as of september ill wrap up my comments on slide with our fourth quarter outlook we expect loans to grow in the range of to with growth focused in strategic segments we expect core deposits to be in the range of third quarter with a yearend loantodeposit ratio in the mid we expect net interest income of million to million on a nonfte basis and excluding accretion approximately million in accretion would be added to the interest income outlook and for those modeling net interest income on an fte basis i would add roughly million to the outlook our net interest income outlook assumes no further fed increases we currently expect nim to be flat to the third quarter noninterest income should be approximately million core expenses are expected to be around million with an efficiency ratio in the range of our expense outlook excludes the fdic special assessment we expect an effective tax rate of well continue to be prudent managers of capital and target a common equity tier ratio of with that ill turn it back to john for closing remarks john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 thanks a lot glenn as i wrap up my remarks i want to hit on the implications of the proposed regulatory changes for banks in excess of billion in assets as its among the topics were most frequently asked about we anticipate it will be several years before we reach the asset threshold at which the proposed regulations would impact webster during that time both the application of the regulations and the operating environment may significantly change as you would expect weve already begun to build the necessary capabilities talent and investment to tackle the enhanced risk framework requirements that may apply to us as we approach billion just as we have tackled the occs heightened standards requirements that came with crossing the billion threshold while there will likely be increased financial burdens such as required debt issuance and compliance costs there could be several paths to absorbing and overcoming these challenges including our increased scale and earnings power in the nearterm we believe our size brings a unique mix of scale and agility relative to many of our regional bank peers well utilize our strong operating position to grow in our key markets and business lines allocating our resources to the highest return opportunities all within a disciplined risk management framework with that i want to wrap up my comments by saying thank you to all our colleagues for their strong efforts both in moving our strategy forward completing the conversion and getting us to where we are today operator with that glenn and i will open up the line to questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of chris mcgratty of keefe bruyette woods your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey chris glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp good morning christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc john maybe a high level question this ongoing derisking that youve been doing i guess where are you in terms of like how much more do you think you need to do i mean the loss rates on the office the implied loss rates on the office from this quarter looks a bit higher than what youve been doing for the last several quarters could you just kind of big picture where are you in terms of derisking the book webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah its interesting i dont think chris theres kind of a dedicated timeline i think were as you heard me say the billion in office we have right now we sort of feel good about with respect on a relative basis to having getting credit enhancements continuing to work on the portfolio so for us its looking at loans looking at the strategic nature of them whether theyre with investors and clients that we know very well that were going to continue doing business with whether theyre standalone transactional what the kind of metrics and dynamics are and then each quarter jason and the team sit down and say hey we even though this may not be a problem now this is something thats not strategic for us or we have an opportunity at a reasonable economic cost to move down so were not really looking at a serial reduction in the exposure were being opportunistic and were making i think the right economic decisions because many of these loans are going to refinance fine theyre going to payoff fine some of which we think in the future may have some problems just given the paradigm shift but i think youll see us continue at this level looking at a million million portfolio or book of business in the quarter and if theres a good economic strategic way to exit those credits we will but were not kind of urgently and in a serial fashion trying to get rid of the exposure christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful maybe glenn you gave the loan to deposit and expectations for the balance sheet how should we be thinking about just the level of borrowings and the securities growth from here or decline glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so i think ill take securities first so were like billion billion i think you would expect expected over the course of say the next couple quarters to stay within that range depending on loan growth the question on borrowings is i think were at a level right now where we probably expect to be pretty flat to the say plus billion mark christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and maybe last one one of your peers turned the buyback back on this quarter im interested in your updated thoughts on whether buybacks at this point of that cycle make sense john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah chris i think its a great question we bought back million in the quarter in  we clearly have capital levels and capacity to generate capital to continue the program i would tell you that were looking at this from a position of having good flexibility but also recognizing that we want to make sure that we have capital if we do tuckin acquisition if we do grow loans significantly if we see cracks in the market from a credit perspective so i guess the way i would characterize it is i wouldnt rule it out but i think were being a little bit more cautious as we look in the fourth quarter to our activities in that area christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks thanks john webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of casey haire of jefferies your line is open casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc just following up i guess glenn on the nim so nim is going to be flat in the fourth quarter and borrowings which obviously helped in the third quarter the decline there sounds like theyre going to be flat so what is the offset to the beta creep that you expect to keep to keep an implied is it loan growth just looking for a little color on what holds nim stable in the fourth quarter glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yes sure so some of it is loan growth some of it is the rate on loans where we get the full benefit of the periodic loans repricing and then you do have we do pick up one day at least on a nim basis from an earnings standpoint and then its pretty much some of thats neutralized by what we think deposit growth will be or deposit cost will be going into the fourth quarter like i said in my comments we still think that theres therell be deposit pressure going into the fourth quarter albeit very more moderate than its been certainly in the last couple of quarters casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and then just a question on the funding strategy i mean your deposit growth was pretty broad based interlink still is doing a lot of the heavy lifting on that slide was it slide its of your deposit franchise what longterm is that a ceiling that you have for interlink or is that is the right level just trying to figure out how big that can become glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so were in the process of doing our outlook over the next couple of quarters and actually years and so i think if were at now depending on our sources of funds and other sources of funds we that could go up plus or minus it could go as high as but thats something that were still in the process of planning right now casey webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got it okay and just last one for me on the efficiency i know its early for but you guys obviously at are in more efficient than most of my coverage universe john you mentioned you are there are going to be some financial burdens about in getting the bank ready to be billion what can you pass that along or is that something that youre you might let the efficiency ratio drip up john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah thats a good question and again as glenn said were working through our plan now and were not going to sort of were not ready to provide guidance for but i will tell you our sense is look we still have some opportunity coming out of the conversion as we consolidate subledgers and look at back office processes and consolidate call centers which we still havent completed so casey we do still have some mergerrelated cost opportunities cost save opportunities and i kind of like where we are our feeling is we also have opportunities to invest and grow particularly if the market greenlights with respect to loan growth and people feel comfortable about a soft landing i think we can identify additional teams in commercial banking to bring on were definitely investing in our products and capital markets and fx and card and other commercial treasury products that enhance our balance of noninterest income so our kind of view is we think we can operate steadily in the low efficiency ratio and to the extent we can gain more cost savings that will itll provide us an opportunity to invest in key products and services and people so if we can continue to post the numbers that we promised when we did the merger the roatce the roa and an efficiency ratio in the low i think size scale and momentum will allow us to keep that efficiency ratio in the low without starving the bank with respect to future investment and then if you fast forward right three years you look at the size of our balance sheet as we approach billion i think well have some optionality and well be in a better place than others who are similarly situated given how kind of efficient our operating model is casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you operator your next question comes from line of matthew breese of stephens inc your line is open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning indiscernible matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i know office cre grabs a lot of the attention these days but i was curious thoughts and updated color on the sponsor specialty and leveraged loan book how have those portfolios been performing in a high rate environment webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah matt so far so good weve talked about it before those companies that we underwrite theyre tend to have protectable predictable cash flow streams recurring cash flow streams contractual cash flow streams and so we havent seen a deterioration significant deterioration in the credit profile id say its behaving like the rest of the book probably some level of moderate negative risk rating migration but it hasnt spooked us at all and again i its always hard to predict the future but one of the wonderful things about that portfolio besides the type of companies that we lend to are the private equity firms that weve been doing business with for and years that are kind of flushed with cash raising new funds and really not reticent to capitulate and give up these really good companies no question about the fact that these are floating generally floating rate loans so their debt service has increased they generally are lower in contractual amortization so really its the interest expense and so far the capacity to continue to service that debt has seemed strong and obviously we feel comfort in the fact that weve got strong private equity firms behind those companies in case things start to go sideways generally we work things through with them and the deals continue to perform so so far id say its coming out according to indiscernible which is theyre able to service the increased interest rate cost and we seem to have pretty stable performance in that book matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and then just a reminder what is the size of the what needs definition of leveraged loans and then anything beyond that that would be considered a syndicated loan portfolio john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah this is its tricky because theres overlap everywhere right and we reported on our regulatory statutory leverage loans that those have actually remained relatively flat over the last couple of quarters its about of our total loan book or billion and most of that as you intimated is in our sponsor and specialty book our shared national credits are about and there are some subset of that which is leveraged but about of total loans that number is actually down from premerger of webster numbers as a percentage of total loans just given kind of the mix that came together between webster and sterling again no kind of differentiated performance there so ive told this story a million times to the street over the last years about shared national credits we dont have a buyside desk were not a indiscernible for the big banks or the nonbanks who are syndicating out loans our use of shared national credits over the last years has been in strategy or in geography or in product meaning that its a middle market or corporate company within our middle market footprint where we have crosssell opportunities direct access to management but they have a million credit facility and certainly we dont have the balance sheet to provide that so well participate in that credit and crosssell its in our sponsor and specialty group where we have expertise in technology and other industry verticals where well strategically participate with access to management again we underwrite and portfolio manage all of our shared national credits exactly the same way we do a bilateral credit and our shared national credit book has a weighted average risk rating of about a full turn basis points better than the overall weighted average risk rating of our commercial portfolio because those bigger webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 companies tend to be more resilient and have more revenue streams so those are the data points and i figured id share with you our view on how we go about underwriting and participating in shared national credits matthew breese q analyst stephens inc so understanding its likely a blend of the leveraged loan portfolio probably some real estate in there is it fair to assume the underwriting characteristics like sponsor and specialty from a leverage perspective are similar to that book and from a commercial real estate perspective or similar to the ltvs and debt service coverage ratios we find in john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i think thats a fair statement but ill also tell you we have very little shared national credit exposure in commercial real estate and i mean very little most of our shared national credit exposure is in sponsor and specialty in our middle market geography groups on midcorporate and large corporate relationships we have and then we have some in assetbased lending those are the ones i worry about the least those are large retailers strong agents cash dominion we generally dont have any problems with those transactions so we dont have very much shared national credit exposure in commercial real estate its just not been one of our tools matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay last one for me john you had mentioned keeping capital handy for perhaps tuckin acquisitions i know historically its been discussions around perhaps hsa tuckin acquisitions but i was curious if that comment meant anything broader as in wholebanks or other sorts of fee income vehicles john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah no a great question and i think we quite clearly mean sort of complementary acquisitions around fee generating or deposit gathering businesses where we have a path to some organic growth but wed like to enhance and speed up that path to get a better balance of noninterest income and interest income rather than a wholebank acquisition we dont feel that right now you never say never and ive learned my lesson there but given where we are the great integration and conversion we just did given the look at the dynamics in the marketplace i would say the highly unlikely wholebank activity on the inorganic side and it would be something it would be targeted on further low cost deposit gathering or fee generating businesses that are complementary to our existing activities matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great ill leave it there thank you for taking all my questions john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mark fitzgibbon of piper sandler your line is open webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hi mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co glenn i wondered if you could share your thoughts on restructuring or selling available for sale securities in the fourth quarter given that rates may be stuck up here for a while glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so it is something we looked at mark and you know that we did that in first quarter of this year we restructured about million at that time what i would say is its something we continually look at and we balance that obviously against our capital levels and our capital forecast and things that we see as far as that so ill leave it at there and that is something that we continue to look at and theres obviously some opportunity there is competing against capital for other initiatives as well so thats where we are on it mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then can you update us on how much you sold in this quarter in performing office loans and roughly where you sold those relative to par glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so i think in my comments there was million that we sold and if you just do the math on the provision of million that equates to about on the dollar mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then lastly hopefully there arent any more failed banks but if there are would webster be a likely interested buyer and some fdic transactions john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah mark its interesting right i just made the comment to matt that wholebank acquisitions are not high priority for us i do think that it would behoove us to just make sure that if there is a clear strategic opportunity that makes a ton of sense economically i guess i wouldnt exclude us right but its im hoping there are no further failed banks as well but i think hopefully if we keep executing where we are then the dust settles i think well be in a good position and have the right financial characteristics and strength to be a buyer of a good strategic bank if something happened that way so i wouldnt rule it out but its certainly not on our game plan webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of brody preston of ubs your line is open brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone how are you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey good morning glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp good morning brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc sorry i joined a little bit late so if i repeat anything just feel free to tell me to review the transcript but i did think john i think i saw you gave the shared national credit percentage at do you happen to have what you guys are the lead underwriter arm or the agent arm john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah less than of that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay so less than of the john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp correct brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay cool and do you happen to have what the reserve on the office portfolio is at this point webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp we havent disclosed that number obviously its moved up and its at a higher level than the overall portfolio but we dont disclose that brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay glenn could you maybe speak around what the puts and the takes will be as it relates to nii and the nim going forward maybe help me better understand the cadence of fixed asset repricing throughout over the fourth quarter and then through and what the impact to loan yields will be to that glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp sure yeah let me give you a sense of and ill just look at the two dynamics that we have there brody are the fixed rate loans repricing and that if you think about it its about billion a quarter right so if you think you just think about that over the next couple of quarters its about billion repricing and given our rate forecast you probably pick up about basis points on that as it rolls forward right over the next couple of quarters and then depending on where the fed is in the back end of the year that might come in a little bit but that dynamic on the fixed rate loans i think about it in terms of the nim it probably supports our nim by about basis points going forward and then likewise on the investment portfolio you have about million that is typically reinvested and for that were probably picking up about basis points now thatll probably drop as rates change to like the low mid but there again were picking up about basis points of nim support going forward so if i look at those two factors as well as the periodic book which will continue to reprice on the loan side and then so you have that is going as a favorable tailwind and then the wildcard here is deposit pricing right and so we do think we did see it moderate in fourth quarter we do think its going to continue to moderate over the next couple of quarters and then the fed will begin to cut therell be a natural like 90day lag on that but we think the support that we have on the repricing side reinvestment side will sort of moderate any pressures that we get on the deposit side at least for the first half of the year and then we should actually we should be wellpositioned if the fed does proceed with cutting on the second half back half of the year brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you for that and then john i know you talked earlier about kind of the leverage loan and the sponsor specialty sponsor book but i guess i wanted to better understand kind of like some of the finer points of the details of the underwriting there and kind of the things you do to structure those loans to really give you protection and im not expecting you speak to the specific credit but like you all were on the right aid credit files for bankruptcy but like the abl filo notes in the market are trading at of par and so like market obviously expects very little loss it looks like you guys and the other banks are in a position to kind of get paid back first and it feels really well collateralized so could you just kind of help us better understand the structure of those deals and what you kind of do to help protect yourself in the event that something goes wrong john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i guess theres a couple questions there because you threw in the abl deal at the end right and so thats i think thats a completely different animal youre underwriting against liquidation value on a large retail company webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 thats kind of standard assetbased lending i do think the market believes what everybody believe is someone will come in and provide debt financing and therell be an orderly liquidation and everyone will get paid out and weve seen that story play over and over again in sponsor and specialty business i guess its about the strength of the people the continuity weve been doing it for years we deal with sponsors we know who support credits and have expertise in the industries and sectors theyre in youd be amazed at the level of diligence and detail we do in technology if were doing a deal as softwareasaservice deal were doing thirdparty evaluations of the software were evaluating the contracts the end users where we know the management team very well we know the sponsors very well we structure the deals that so theres some level of amortization we dont chase as you know the last couple of turns of leverage where the nonbanks are chasing we play in a different market so its just a combination of having the right people a really disciplined approach staying in the swim lanes and the sectors that we know and understand and not moving off of that disciplined process and its why through the great financial crisis and through the pandemic and through this higher interest rate environment weve been able to see resilience in that portfolio brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then the last one from me i just wanted to ask around the hsa book i feel like this has been a topic thats come up sporadically over the last several years but i wanted to ask just because other banks are looking to potentially monetize unique assets that they have and so when i look at kind of whats happened in hsa it feels like some of your nonbank competitors have been able to really kind of pay really high multiples to acquire other hsa portfolios that otherwise i think if they had the same investor base that you do they wouldnt be able to pay as much and so with the growth in that business line kind of slowing to some extent and the value of it really not showing up in the multiple and it being tough to kind of inorganically grow that business just given that youre treated like a bank versus others that are treated like nonbanks like how do you think about maybe monetizing that and doing something more strategic there to help your investors realize the full value of that business john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thats a great question and i think all of your observations in general are correct and weve talked about it over time the basic premise for us is that we have a very efficient way to deploy long duration low cost deposits as a bank that really helped profitability for us and while the market has slowed if you look at it youre still growing deposits at very low costs in the mid to high singledigits and there arent many channels that are doing that so and we are continuing to grow along with the market on an organic basis so i take your point in terms of the inorganic growth of some of the other top five players so it is very valuable to us it helps us generate the kind of returns and profitability we have albeit its a smaller part of the whole after the moe we are frustrated that the market doesnt recognize the value that were still building in that business as part of the bank and as you know we continue we talk about it all the time to evaluate hsa in the bank and the value it has in the bank outside of the bank because we have an obligation to make sure that were making the best decisions for our shareholders as we move forward and so up until now its continued particularly in this interest rate environment its pretty easy for us to say operating hsa as a division of our bank creates the most value for our shareholders in the longterm in terms of the quality and the value of the cash flows we dont think the market where were trading at a times multiple on future earnings is reflecting that unique company and webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 business and we want to continue to keep informing people and educating people about where we are we were able to execute on ph bend transaction last year which gave us higher levels of user experience and a better mousetrap if you will and i think its helped us compete in the marketplace we are still looking every time theres a deal in the market another portfolio because the market keeps consolidating i think the top now represent of the market well try and be in a participant in that but i think its going to be to continue evaluation for us and well make the right decision on where hsa belongs given the value we can create owning it or the value that it would receive as a different company or a company that was part of a joint venture or somewhere else outside the bank brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you for taking my questions everyone i appreciate it operator your next question comes from line of daniel tamayo of raymond james your line is open daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone thanks for taking my question maybe just starting in the decline in the commercial industrial commercial loan areas and you talked about deemphasizing some asset classes there just give a little more detail on where you were pulling back and i apologize i jumped on a little late if you already covered that john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp no its quite all right its a good question and we havent covered it in detail so the decline across the board on the ci side was generally driven by we had mortgage warehouse obviously down and i think youll likely can see that continuing to reduce from a strategic perspective we were very careful on transactiononly abl and equipment finance in the quarter since the crisis in march and so those did grow rapidly and may have had small declines our fund banking activity which high quality fund banking loans equity subscription lines to private equity firms was down about billion and that was driven by one big payoff and then just lower utilization our overall middle market ci utilization on lines after kind of holding steady for several quarters at was down into the mid so we did see seasonally lower usage and i dont know what that portends in terms of client confidence or anything but utilization was lower as well so that kind of drove the quarter results some of it was us pulling back on levers some of it was a seasonally slow third quarter more sluggish loan growth and thats where we ended up i think as you go forward weve talked about really making sure that we have the liquidity capacity the loan to deposit ratio and the capital to grow those full relationships across our middle market businesses or other ancillary ci businesses sponsor and specialty nonoffice commercial real estate we are seeing some level of increased demand as we move into the fourth quarter our pipelines up about billion so i think you think well make well continue to see mortgage warehouse run down there may be a couple of other small subscale businesses where we wont be generating the kind of loan growth that weve generated in the past but we think we can offset that with our core franchise building loan generation daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 terrific and then on the flip side the commercial classified loans were up both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of that portfolio maybe you could talk a little bit about what drove that increase john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp sure happy to first of all i didnt say up in my front comments but i did reference that that level of classified that of a smaller portfolio in the quarter is actually basis points lower than websters classified percentage in the fourth quarter of before the pandemic so just a reminder again that weve been the entire industry has been benefiting from really really favorable credit metrics and this is just a small step i think towards a more normalized rate going forward but in terms of the actual contributions there there werent any kind of correlations across geography asset class business lines we saw some ci and healthcare we had a small portion in abl we had some office migration that we talked about prior and then just generally across the other ci categories so it really wasnt we didnt see correlated risk we just saw creditspecific migration as part of our overall modest negative risk rating migration in the portfolio daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay terrific and lastly just one for glenn on the hedging strategy and how you expect the net interest income would react to rate cuts if they do materialize next year glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so daniel good morning we did talk a little about that as we look were not providing an outlook for at this point the point i made earlier is that i think our nim will continue to be supported into the fourth quarter and into the next couple of quarters through the benefit of both fixed rate loans repricing investment securities repricing as well as the periodic loans repricing some of that will be obviously offset by deposit cost in our thinking on where the cumulative deposit beta will end up but i think generally thats how were feeling going into the next couple of quarters daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thanks for all the color guys appreciate it glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp sure john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steve alexopoulos of jpmorgan your line is open alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone alex lau on for steve webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey alex alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey i want to touch on deposits so noninterestbearing deposits were up on a period end basis in the quarter what drove that uptick was it seasonal inflows and is it fair to say that the customers chasing higher yield products in these demand balances are largely done glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so let me take that and john and but i think there is a portion of the increase in noninterestbearing deposits that was related to the government inflow which is seasonality but i think the bigger point is weve gone back and looked at dda because were as we look at our forecast and ive gone back to all the way back to when if i add the combination of webster and sterling we had about billion in combined deposits and at that point the dda represented about if i looked at the third quarter and did the same sort of analysis and i stripped out the impact of interlink its relatively new will be in that range so its prepandemic and if i look to where we are its typically run about i think there will be some continued normalization in the average balances as customers move and weve looked at this on a customer by customer basis so there is some migration into higher yielding type of products but i think some of that to say i think look at normalization over the next couple of quarters but i think some of that will be offset by growth opportunities through whether its new relationship acquisitions or treasury management type services so i think if you think about that ph we have there will be puts and takes on that but over the course of time and were not giving guidance for that should be somewhere in the range john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp i agree with that glenn yeah alex i think your last statement was right that were going to continue to see a creep up of the deposit cost there in the core but that the rate of increase is slowing down because the customer behavior people that were more in tune and it was more important to them to chase rate have done so alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you and speaking of growth opportunities now that the conversion with sterling is done do you see any material crossselling opportunities in terms of growing these demand deposits now that youre integrated with sterling john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i mean i think i kind of hinted to that alex that one of the things that getting on our single core platform now and also being able to kind of pivot our resources to development and build out weve got a robust plan on the treasury side in commercial and thats broadly defined with cash management products fx capital markets other products corporate card where we believe that having deeper penetration and having a broader product webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 set for our really loyal commercial customers will have the added benefit of growing core operating deposits so i do think that thats something that we believe we can execute on and we believe will be successful as we move forward postconversion alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you for that and then i just had a followup on the hsa business so these balances for the past three quarters have been in the billion range can you talk about what it would take in the macro environment for a stronger hsa adoption for these balances to start increasing john i think you said mid to high singledigit how do we get to the higher end of the range would a weaker job market actually benefit this range thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yes its interesting we used to answer these questions all the time but i think generally higher healthcare costs push companies to higher adoption of full replacement high deductible health plans definitely if it was in a recessionary environment if labor market is not quite as tight companies are more willing to move to higher replacement cost i will tell you we believe that part of full transparency right part of the reason the market slowed a bit is that theres been significant penetration and adoption now so there arent as many green fields in terms of new opportunities but in this economic environment and in this job market environment we have obviously seen slower growth and im not rooting for a worse job market or a big recession so that we get a slight increase in our hsa growth but i think those are some of the dynamics there are higher healthcare costs coming in so i do know that people are continuing to look at it and ph chad does see opportunity and were obviously got a lot of rfps out there but the market from the growth days down to the growth days theres a lot of dynamics there and its not just economic its also just a maturing of the industry operator thank you now that we are close to end of conference we please ask you try to restrict yourself to one question so we can get everyone in the next question comes from the line of bernie von gizycki of deutsche bank your line is open bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah hi good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so my question is hey my question is on fees specifically so you talked about the pressure on fees from less capital markets activity but you have seen signs of an improving outlook into next year what are you hearing from clients what signs do you see that helps drive that improving outlook and maybe if i just combine this on the sterling integration you basically highlighted some areas in treasury cash management but in the fee side webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 could you provide any size timing of these opportunities so cap markets pick up next year and sterling integration opportunities sizing john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah its a great question i think ill stick with glenns comment that were working through our plan right now for and we havent sized some of those opportunities and the timing of the rollout as it relates to bau and organic where we are we did see in the quarter a relatively healthy level of noninterest income and underneath that were some good signs a little bit more of direct investment equity tag in income which shows some more activity on the sponsor side and that people may be getting more active as they normally do at yearend and so were thats a good sign for us as we move forward obviously the swap market given where interest rates are has been kind of down but we may see some more activity just given the fact that the fed may pivot so theres some decent signs and then well be able to as we give guidance in  we run out our roadmap on plan be able to maybe size some of the incremental benefit of postconversion investment operator thank you your next question comes from the line of timur braziler of wells fargo your line is open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc im wondering what the remaining credit mark is on the sterling book and then if you look at the linked quarter increase in allowance how much of that is commensurate with the linked quarter increase in classified loans and im just wondering kind of your expectation for allowance trajectory here given the macro backdrop john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah a good question i always kind of like and dislike answering these cecl questions because theres obviously a huge amount of work that goes into the modeling obviously a classified loan has a higher reserve on it so the dynamics in the quarter for cecl would be higher level of classified overall lower loan balances stable nonaccruals and chargeoff levels and economic outlook for us as were moving forward its why you still see a build in most of the industry right now because of concerns of office and others and then qualitative overlays on what you believe is going on in any particular portfolio like an office portfolio so the classified certainly would have been a component to add more reserves but there are some offsets like lower loan balances and stability in other areas and then obviously the economic outlook is still uncertain which webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 drives to a few basis point increase and im giving you kind of the qualitative high level because obviously its all modeldriven at the end of the day glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah and timur its glenn the only thing i would point out is we sort of laid this out on page of the slides right so you can see the impact of lower loan balances was million and then the macro third quarter macro and credit environment was a build of ph and if you look at the chart below there hasnt been that much movement really in unemployment and gdp growth and stuff like that so a portion of that is risk migration which you see in the classifieds and thats how id sort of characterize it operator thank you and your last question comes from the line of laurie hunsicker of seaport research partners your line is open laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc great hi thanks john and glenn good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning laurie laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc so just wanted to circle back to office here so slide is great but just wondered couple of things number one can you help us think about specifically in new york city and boston of that billion how much of that is new york city class a versus class b how much is boston class a versus class b and then also your slide is only investor can you help us think about the owneroccupied book how big that is any concerns that youre seeing there obviously owneroccupied is lower risk but and is still some of the same risks and then the last part of the office question the jump in past due loans from million to million roughly how much of that million jump was officerelated thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp all right i may ask you to come back on the last question but the one indiscernible the mix of a and b is pretty similar around in all the markets which also ladders up to the overall weve about right of the remaining offices in new york city and thats about class a and class b boston is smaller in the geography under of that and its also about in terms of class a and class b you asked about non investor cre owneroccupied cre so those would be ci companies that we lend to where we have office collateral thats a relatively small portion of our overall portfolio its around million which is pretty small regulatorily and internally we underwrite those as you know ci loans based on the cash flows of the company with having just the enhanced secondary source of repayment in the office weve seen no deterioration in that portfolio at all and what was the last question laurie laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 yeah just the indiscernible the jump in the past due loans the million to million how much of that if any was offset john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp oh thats a great question i dont know if i know the answer to that offhand but i will tell you one thing is that there was a million payment made on the 2nd of october so one of them was an administrative delinquency and so i would tell you that were down from million to whatever that would be million if i can do my math right mostly equipment finance loans in there so it really wasnt commercial real estates glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp its not yeah its not laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc right thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp you got it operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call over to john ciulla ceo for closing remarks john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you very much for joining us on this long call this morning enjoy the day operator this concludes todays conference call you may now disconnect
