joining us today ill provide remarks on our highlevel results and strategic positioning before turning it over to glenn to cover our financial results in greater detail webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 first quarter of was a memorable one for the banking industry unfortunately highlighted by high profile bank failures that caused dislocation across the system the good news is that the industry remains fundamentally strong and well capitalized and the nearterm view is less volatile than a month ago websters results in the quarter are reflective of our resilient business model and a shifting environment for banking we continue to deliver for our clients and in the quarter we prudently grew loans and core deposits we generated solid returns and our asset quality profile remained effectively unchanged from the prior quarter on an adjusted basis we generated eps of in light of the market dislocation and out of an abundance of caution we took actions to augment our balance sheet liquidity including increasing our cash position and utilizing highercost funding sources we also saw a decline in fees as a result of reduced direct investment gains and overall client financing activities among other effects due to these actions and some seasonal factors our ppnr was down from the prior quarter our adjusted roaa of was up from a year ago and our return on tangible common equity was a strong up from last year loans grew on a linked quarter basis with a focus on strategic categories with attractive risk profiles our total deposits were up also on a linked quarter basis with core deposits up while it seems like ages ago many of you attended our investor day on march just days before the market disruption during that event we provided a transparent look at our goforward strategies and differentiated businesses with a focus on our unique funding profile and credit and risk management practices all of which are especially beneficial during times of stress and uncertainty while ill touch again on some of the points we made in early march i would encourage you to revisit the investor day presentation and webcast that are posted on our website as we believe the attributes we outlined will continue to benefit our company and drive outperformance regardless of the operating environment let me spend just a minute on deposit and deposit trends and then provide you with an update on our office portfolio two topics that i know are of significant interest im on page of our presentation the unique qualities of our deposit franchise remain a core strength of webster our deposits consist of billion of consumer deposits largely originated in our retail footprint to long tenured clients billion of hsa bank deposits the entirety of these deposits are individual customer accounts and nearly all are within fdic insurance coverage limits and as you know hsa deposits are long duration and low cost billion of business banking deposits within our commercial bank generally these are smaller dollar and behave similarly to those in the consumer book billion of public fund deposits within the commercial bank the majority of which are collateralized with highly predictable behavioral characteristics our remaining commercial deposits of billion are diverse by industry customer type and geography there are no sector concentrations and these deposits are relatively small balance in nature with an average balance of less than per account i refer you again to chris motls presentation at investor day where we broke down the multiple deposit generating businesses in our commercial bank franchise and finally interlink the acquisition of which we completed in the first quarter has already proven to be highly valuable provides readily available core deposit funding to almost all fdic insured deposits and we have access to these funds at a very low cost of acquisition in summary between the consumer bank hsa and interlink of our total deposit accounts are consumer oriented small balance accounts that are long duration in nature webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 the past month of deposit activity highlights the tremendous value of our deposit franchise customer activity within the consumer bank and hsa was business as usual throughout the entire quarter and both of these categories grew in  in midmarch within the commercial bank we saw elevated twoway activity for a few days as clients looked to diversify their deposit concentrations but that activity quickly resumed its normal course i would also note that we have opened approximately accounts primarily operating accounts that are in the process of being funded with new commercial depositors since the middle of march in addition to the strength of our overall deposit franchise we maintained significant alternate sources of liquidity this is displayed on slide as of yesterday we had billion of immediately available liquidity between cash balances and undrawn borrowing facilities this represents of our uninsured and uncollateralized deposits we expect this ratio will continue to grow over the short term as it relates to credit at investor day jason soto our chief credit officer detailed the quality of our loan portfolio we are proud of our credit risk framework and our risk selection for many quarters our origination efforts have been focused on existing customers and higherrated loans our strict underwriting standards include stress testing economic and interest rate sensitivity and we continue to perform robust reviews of portfolio segments that are sensitive to environmental trends we proactively sold loans last year where we believed it would maximize our economics and help reduce future credit risk the net result of all of our actions is that the weighted average risk rating in our loan portfolio has improved over the past year each quarter and is unchanged on a linked quarter basis as you will see in our disclosures the level of classified assets in our portfolio has remained stable as well on slide we have refreshed and augmented our disclosures on our office portfolio as you can see our nonmedical office portfolio represents just of total loans has a low atorigination ltv a strong current and updated debt service coverage ratio profile has limited lease maturities and each of the next two years is diversified across geographies and thus far continues to perform well in fact criticized assets have fallen to of loans from of loans in the fourth quarter of ill also remind you that the billion in office exposure is down million or from the close our moe as we were proactive in managing this portfolio during and weve originated only a nominal amount of office exposure since the two banks came together a year ago with that ill turn it over to glenn to review the financial statements in more detail glenn i macinnes chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thanks john good morning everyone ill start on slide with our gaap in adjusted earnings we reported gaap net income to common shareholders of million with earnings per share of on an adjusted basis we reported net income to common shareholders of million and eps of after excluding onetime aftertax expenses of million merger expenses were related to professional fees severance and other compensationrelated charges and a provision adjustment for acquired unfunded lending commitments the strategic initiative expense is related to repositioning of our securities portfolio webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 next ill review balance sheet trends beginning on slide total assets were billion at period end up of billion from the fourth quarter as we bolstered our balance sheet liquidity and had billion in loan growth our securities balance increased modestly in the quarter as discussed at our investor day we sold million in lower yield securities in january recording a loss on sale the proceeds were used to purchase higher yielding securities resulting in an earn back of less than one year aoci attributed to unrealized losses against our afs portfolio improved to million from million last quarter in a steady interest rate environment we anticipate roughly million of this will accrete back into capital annually loan growth was billion driven primarily by commercial banking deposits were up billion from quarter end reflective of growth in interlink hsa and our cd portfolio and matched our quarterly loan growth from quarter end through april deposits have grown another billion borrowings increased by billion as we enhanced our liquidity position in light of recent market events our borrowings included billion of fhlb advances while we continue to enhance our liquidity profile as the funding rate environment stabilizes we anticipate holding more normalized levels of cash while replacing wholesale borrowings with deposit funding our capital levels remain strong as evidenced by our common equity tier ratio of and a tangible common equity ratio of and lastly we continue to grow tangible book value which ended the quarter at per share loan trends are highlighted on slide in total we grew loans by billion or on a linked quarter basis loan growth was diverse by category commercial grew by million commercial real estate grew by million and residential mortgage balances were up modestly the yield on the portfolio increased basis points as loan yield outpaced increases in deposit costs excluding accretion loan yields increased by basis points floating and periodic rate loans remained approximately at quarter end we provide additional detail on deposits on slide with total deposits of billion from prior quarter or in addition to growth in interlink and hsa we added million in cds our total deposit costs were up basis points to basis points for a cumulative cycletodate beta of its worth repeating that between consumer hsa and interlink of our deposits are in consumeroriented long duration categories and to a large extent fully fdic insured in our hsa business the average account balance is under in consumer banking our average account balance is under and in commercial bank our average account balance is under on slide you see the forward progression of our deposit beta assumptions we anticipate our total cycleto date deposit beta will increase to by the first quarter of with a more significant ramp in the second quarter followed by fairly steady progression throughout the remainder of the year moving to slide you can see our reported to adjusted income statement compared to the adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter of net interest income was down million or linked quarter reflecting a shorter day count and a funding mix shift inclusive of the actions to augment our liquidity adjusted fees were down million while expenses remained effectively flat ill provide additional line item detail on subsequent slides the net interest margin was down basis points from the prior quarter and our efficiency ratio was on slide net interest income was down million linked quarter or day count was roughly a headwind to net interest income growth quarteroverquarter excluding accretion income net interest income would have been down million or just net interest margin excluding accretion decreased basis points from the prior quarter webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 while yield on earning assets excluding accretion increased basis points over the prior quarter the decline in nim was driven by higher funding costs as we enhanced our liquidity position total cost of funds was up basis points quarteroverquarter slide which highlight our fee income for the quarter on an adjusted basis fees were down million linked quarter the primary drivers of the decline were lower direct investment income lower client hedging activity and valuation marks and lower client contract fees i will detail our outlook for the year later in my remarks but we expect to recapture a portion of the hedging and valuation mark as well as the direct investment income as we move through noninterest expenses are highlighted on slide we reported an adjusted expense of million in line with prior quarter the results reflect lower compensation and marketing expenses which were offset by an increase in the fdic assessment rate intangible amortization on interlink and operating costs associated with strategic investments including the bend and interlink acquisitions slide details components of our allowance for credit losses which was up million over prior quarter after recording million in net chargeoffs we incurred million in provision expense with loan growth representing million and the macro and credit factors of million additionally we completed the adoption of the tdr accounting rules effective january of this year this resulted in a million increase in reserve which was recorded as a charge to retained earnings as a result youll see our coverage ratio increased modestly to slide highlights our key asset quality metrics on the upper left nonperforming assets declined million from prior quarter and represent basis points of loans commercial classified loans as a percent of commercial loans declined to from despite a modest increase of million on an absolute basis net chargeoffs on the upper right totaled million or basis points of average loans on an annualized basis on slide we continue to exhibit strong capital levels all capital levels remain in excess of regulatory and internal targets our common equity tier ratio was and our tangible common equity ratio was our tangible book value per share increased to a share and in the last quarter including both afs and htm marks on our securities portfolio our tce ratio would be approximately and our common equity tier ratio would be approximately both as of march ill wrap up my comments on slide with our fullyear outlook for we expect loans to grow in the range of to with growth focused in strategic segments we expect a fullyear core deposit growth of to with a yearend loantodeposit ratio in the range of and we expect net interest income of billion to billion on a nonfte basis excluding accretion we expect million in accretion would be added to that interest income outlook for those modeling our net interest income on an fte basis i would add roughly million to the outlook our net interest income outlook includes the growth expectations above along with a 25basis point rate hike in may we assume that fed fund rate remains flat for the remainder of at fee income should be in a range of million to million core expenses are expected to be billion or billion with an efficiency ratio of roughly we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of to webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 we continue to be prudent managers of capital capital actions will be dependent on the market environment we continue to target a common equity tier ratio of over time with that ill turn it back over to john for closing remarks john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks glenn on page ill briefly hit on the next steps of our merger integration as we have or soontocomplete the largest aspects of bringing our company together most notably our core conversion is approaching in a few months time we successfully ran our first mock conversion last weekend and have several others planned through our golive date the list of additional integration activities outstanding is short as we approach our core conversion though we will continue to use the scale of our platform to invest in our technology people and continuing to improve the client experience were fortunate to operate from a position of strength our interest rate risk management diversity of funding and growing deposit base efficient operations and ability to invest in our platform position us well for the future we maintain high levels of capital both on a stated and marked basis and exhibit robust internal capital generation and the ability to consistently grow tangible book value per share going forward while the shift in operating environment will weigh on our nim to a degree our loan yields continue to reprice higher and we will continue to lock in the benefits of a higher interest rate environment the fullyear guidance we provided today is based on our best thinking around our base case for the impact of macro factors and its too early to anticipate all the effects of the recent events including future regulatory costs or the depth of a potential recession later in the year with that said its our strategic aim to ensure we continue to position our bank to support our key clients and business segments through any operating environment well continue to prudently grow loans and add franchise enhancing full relationships all within the confines of the credit economic and funding environment this will likely mean closer scrutiny of new and existing businesses and continued focus on funding loans with growing core deposits well continue to be good stewards of capital and well manage our balance sheet in an efficient and prudent manner depending on the environmental opportunities andor challenges in summary we expect we will continue to generate return to the top of our peer group thanks to the strength ive highlighted today i want to make this important point we believe that based on our guidance we provided our yearend performance metrics will continue to meet or exceed the targets we set forth not only at merger announcement but at investor day last month thats an roatce of approximately an roaa in range and efficiency ratio around we believe those metrics will still be kind of bestinclass in our peer group thank you to our colleagues for their exceptional work in this quarter they made special efforts to engage and stay in front of our clients and have kept our organization operating at a high level through an unusual period and before i conclude i just want to express our support for our colleagues at old national bank after the events that took place earlier this month in louisville we know a number of individuals there they run an organization of very strong character and we want jim ryan and their entire team to know that webster and the rest of the industry has them in our thoughts webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 operator glenn and i will open it up to questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from chris mcgratty from keefe bruyette woods please go ahead your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey john just want to make sure the roatce the and the what was the time period again just want to make sure i got it john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp the two years merger so think fourth quarter christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great in terms of the balance sheet could you help us with just your expectations for interlink from here how much youre going to continue to pull on that i mean maybe the implications for borrowings and ultimately where you wanted the loantodeposit to settle glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah hey so chris let me take that its glenn good morning so we think that the interlink will probably close the year closer to billion right now and so november as of now were at almost billion as of yesterday so were well on the path there john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp and chris weve talked about the beauty of that as its a lever we can pull adjust it down from an accordion perspective so if we continue to see momentum out of the business lines with respect to deposit growth we can throttle that down but its a wonderful tool to have particularly in this environment christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 and then just lastly on the buyback obviously lot of your peers indiscernible macro uncertainty i guess where do you shake out in terms of thinking about this in terms of timing john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i think thats great obviously with the uncertainty in the market we in the first quarter we werent active and in the second quarter well likely wont be but we do believe in our model now and our base case of whats going to happen in the macro environment as things settle that therell be several hundred million dollars in buybacks in the third and fourth quarter but again i always want to caveat that with the fact that well be prudent given the environment that well be in but certainly at this valuation its an attractive investment for us to return capital that way christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thanks a lot operator our next question comes from casey haire from jefferies please go ahead your line is open casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc a couple of questions on the expense front so the strategic expenses up on the quarter was any of that relating to the control issues around that caused the 10k delay john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah the answer is no it has to do with what were doing with respect to our conversion and other merger related charges so we have not had material expense increases related to resolution of the mw and were well on the path of remediation of all that too so its not going to pop anywhere casey haire q analyst jefferies llc so consistent with what you guys talked about at investor day this is not going to have a is not going to lead to a meaningful impact on expenses john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp no no webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and just following up so the efficiency ratio in the first quarter you guys are still shooting for that level which implies a sub efficiency ratio in the remaining quarters despite youre keeping your expense guide the same but youve taken down your revenue so im just trying to square what appears to be a tougher outlook and still holding that efficiency ratio glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yes so you saw our expenses for the first quarter at million basically flat quarteroverquarter so we think we have some opportunity there but i think as you push it forward we still feel good about operating in the range so we were a little elevated this quarter and i think itll play off fine john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah casey if you again look at the middle ranges of our guidance i think that comes out to about a so kind of flat and i said around with our targets i think we do have opportunities and levers to pull once we get through conversion on expenses and so i think thats where well be right in that low range casey haire q analyst jefferies llc very good thank you and just last one any commentary on hsa up yearoveryear i think thats a little bit lighter than what you guys talked about in investor day although john i agree with you that seems like a long time ago now but just color on a midsingledigit growth rate in hsa yearoveryear john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp so i think were where we are is kind of the industry growth slowed a little bit were pretty happy with where we are with respect to yearoveryear and the first quarter growth so i would say i dont think its anything unusual casey were still bullish its very difficult to find deposit growth in the highsingle digits on lowcost deposits so nothing unusual and actually i think we had a pretty good quarter relative to what devenir and yearoveryear relative to what devenir showed in terms of industry growth casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks guys john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from matthew breese from stephens please go ahead your line is open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 good morning i wanted to touch on credit first could you just give us some sense on loan resets for commercial real estate what is the average kind of change in loan yield for loans coming out of id assume vintages to today and what kind of impact does that have on debt service coverage ratios and then the second question i have is just same type of profile right or vintages to today whats kind of the average change in cap rates that youre using when you underwrite those properties and how are borrowers behaving and reacting to these changes john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah its interesting its hard to give sort of a blanket response to that because what were seeing is in maturities obviously what were doing is were renegotiating with borrowers theyre putting in either more proceeds or rates are increasing if were taking a little bit more risk on the ltv and debt service coverage ratios im trying to pull up some data i have around i think were a couple hundred basis points up from a cap rate perspective was our kind of allin yield thats probably up in march in commercial real estate thats probably up basis points since the and range and thats kind of what were originating now id say some of the research we have matt shows that like if a decline in noi increases im sorry impacts dcr about basis points im trying to think of my ltv number that i had here give me one second oh basis point increase in cap rates increases ltvs by about to in our portfolio as weve been going down and reviewing all of those dynamics so what i would say is were not seeing any issues with respect to current debt service coverage on our commercial real estate and as its coming up for renewal weve been taking really aggressive proactive steps to either rightsize the proceeds or work with the borrower to get additional enhancements if were settling for a lower debt service coverage ratio and a higher ltv so so far if you look at all of our asset classes we gave you a lot in office were in pretty good shape there and i think on one of the slides in office we showed the maturities left this year weve already kind of resolved about million in maturities in office in and we did that by either getting additional credit enhancements paying down the proceeds and working and getting additional equity from our borrowers and obviously as were settling those at the new yield were still comfortable that weve got reasonable debt service coverage and were still within ltvs matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay thank you and then i was hoping you could just talk about the new york city market in the wake of signature and everything going now with some of the other players in that market being dislocated does it change your view of how you attack or kind of man the field in regards to new york city what kind of opportunity is there to take market share in the wake of this disruption john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i guess we look at it two ways right so you think about managing from a credit perspective all of our new york city real estate exposure and i think the critical thing is we look again at having strong borrowers strong sponsors strong property and conservatively underwritten loans and so while obviously we believe that theyll be stressed particularly with the loans that signature bank will be selling and that new york community bank webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 didnt buy were not too worried about the impact on the overall market as long as weve got really good sponsors standing behind their properties and were able to work through borrowers and as we said in our commercial real estate portfolio in new york theres no cliff there right weve got limited maturities strong lease flows good ltvs and so were working with each of our individual borrowers as we move forward i think as the dust settles matt and we think about opportunities in the market we do believe that therell be potentially teams available we do believe that therell be highquality transactions available to us i think right now if you think about what our management team has been focused on for the last quarter its obviously what youd want us to be focused on which is making sure that weve got strong liquidity that were looking at our own credit and that were thinking about how were going to be able to react in the future and how much flexibility we have given our funding advantage given the fact that we think we can continue to grow deposits i think we will opportunistically take share but we want to make sure were doing it in asset classes we think are strong with the right relationships and at the right time so i do think theres an opportunity for us to continue to smartly grow our book there but were also very cognizant of the market dynamics in new york right now the potential for a recession at the end of the year so what id say is yes opportunity in the future but really prudent about how we go about deciding where and when to take that share matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it understood last one for me just on the interest rate sensitivity i see in the down rate 100basis point scenario i think nii is down now about this is off from i think at yearend as you continue to move the ball forward on this front by the time we do get to and potentially close to rate cuts where do you expect the balance sheet sensitivity on this metric to be glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so let me take that matt so you probably see on the same chart i think youre back on page or so that weve continued for we continue to reduce our asset sensitivity and so weve done some things that weve talked about at investor day of loan swaps collars and things like that so we continue to manage that down i dont think well be at a neutral point but i think we continue just to work that down matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay understood thats all i had thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks matt webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 operator our next question comes from daniel tamayo from raymond james please go ahead your line is open daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks good morning everyone john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey daniel daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc just one question for me i think glenn you mentioned that you expect to hold a higher percentage of normalized excess cash kind of going forward curious if thats similar to the amount that youre holding now or if you expect that to grow and kind of the timeframe where you think that might have to stay on the balance sheet thanks glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yes so thank you and good morning so we are holding right now elevated cash levels and i think over the course of the next couple of quarters well manage that down to a more normalized level and say that level is about billion as opposed to i think in the quarter were billion i think youll see that elevated in the second quarter a little bit because thats we only closed out the quarter so we continue to build some cash balances but well continue to manage that down for the remainder of the year and obviously that has implications from a nim standpoint right because its basically it doesnt it drives two charges from nim so youll see probably a little bit more nim compression in the third quarter but then as we deploy that cash and draw it down then it should come back up daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and this is all contemplated in your guidance the way you just laid it out glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yes yeah it is it is daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thanks thats all i had i appreciate it john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 operator our next question comes from mark fitzgibbon from piper sandler please go ahead your line is open mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co first question i had you had about million in commercial real estate growth in the first quarter was any particular concentrations that came in john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp it wasnt i can tell you again office is obviously disfavored but if you think about kind of multifamily across our footprint industrial mixed use thats kind of where it is mark and pretty spread across geographies the other interesting thing about commercial real estate and quite frankly all loan growth in the quarter mark is that prepays were down significantly so our originations were actually down materially from a year ago but obviously market conditions are having it so that properties arent trading in the regular ci and in the sponsor book the transaction volume is not as high so i just throw that in there for context that to get million of growth in the quarter the level of originations did not have to be nearly as high as it was a year ago where there was a lot more prepayments as well mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then secondly im curious if youre seeing any pressure to boost hsa deposit rates and is your modeling assuming that your deposit costs there stay at around basis points going forward john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yes so we are modeling at basis points you probably saw two quarters ago we did increase the rate so it went from like a basis points or basis points to basis points but as far as the data on that is at the very low end of the range so its one of those obviously one of those funding sources that are really important to us at a time like now mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then lastly i saw in some of the local papers here in connecticut that you expect you had a customer data breach i wondered if you could share with us whether thats likely to result in a large charge in coming quarters webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah we actually mark dont think therell be any financial impact to us as we said its a thirdparty vendor that we use for fraud monitoring that experienced the data security incident and had the release of our information and weve communicated with regulators and clients none of our systems were impacted and we believe that there will be no material financial impact to webster with respect to all aspects of putting that behind us mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you mark operator our next question comes from steve alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning john good morning glenn john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey steve glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so i wanted to start in the aftermath of silicon valley bank can you walk us through what happened to your deposit base john i thought you said there were inflows and outflows and im particularly curious on the sterling side john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah interestingly there was no differentiation really between the two legacy banks which i hate to say at this juncture into our deal and so behaviorally steve what we saw across the new webster was the same across our footprint which was as i mentioned business as usual in consumer and hsa we literally grew organically our consumer deposits across our branch footprint which was a terrific job by the team there in commercial across all of our relationships and across all of our business lines we had a handful of large deposit commercial customers think million million who either from pressure from their board or a webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 notforprofit they had a board that pushed on fiduciary duty and obviously im sure youre hearing this from everyone else in those two or three days that moved a portion of those deposits likely to where you work steve to jpm or the like and the interesting points there steve no one closed accounts no one drove their balances down to the fdic insurance limits they took million deposits a million or million deposit to million deposit and the more sophisticated borrowers and the larger corporate borrowers were the ones that kind of acted the most from that fiduciary weve seen that settle down really really quickly and you can see it in our numbers our commercial deposits were down some quartertoquarter were seeing some of that flow back were also seeing a significant amount of new deposit openings and i dont like to attribute it to the two bank failures but obviously activities in our footprint there are people that are reaching out to us and so weve got opportunity as we fund those accounts to grow our commercial deposits again so it was shorter lived than we thought with respect to the unusual activity we did see some level of outflow which quickly stabilized and now were on a trajectory where we think well continue to grow our core commercial deposits and no difference across geography or legacy bank steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful very helpful actually if i could shift to the loan side so the downshift in loan growth which is modest right you took the ranges down by each but how much of that is tied to you guys tightening the credit box first just assuming therell be less demand in the market just given the economic outlook john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp its a great question i talked about this yesterday steve i think there are three implications number one and probably most importantly to put a fine point on your question we probably lowered the guidance because of organic lower fed h8 loan demand so the market there is less loan demand and thats going to be a driver two i dont know whether its us shrinking the credit box but as we get into a more cyclical time potential recession a little more choppiness obviously were less inclined to lend into those industries that have significant cyclicality and maybe others that are under pressure so that has the impact of sort of shrinking the credit box maybe not tightening standards but shrinking the credit box and then obviously as it relates to liquidity and as liquidity continues to flow out of the industry i think thatll have an impact on everyones loan growth as they get a little bit more selective and prioritize existing customers over maybe new customers or national businesses that dont have deposit relationships with them so i think thats in the order of prioritization the three things that will have us going from a highsingle digits to midsingle digits steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thats great and maybe one last one for glenn around the margin so if the fed starts cutting rates at some point and i know your outlook is rates flat for the rest of the year but lets say they assume cut start cutting either second half of this year or early next year how do you think about the delay the lag in terms of either months or percentage of rate change we need before you could start reducing the cost of interestbearing deposits webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp on the deposit side so i think look i think if you look at our deposit beta weve lagged like two quarters or so in rate increases but i think on the way down as the fed begins to cut its probably within three months you begin to see it pretty quickly so i think the reaction on the way down would be more significant than the lag on the way up steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay perfect so that glenn if we did see that play out for the second half we saw two rate cuts would that materially impact this terminal beta youre calling out or would it not be material glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp no well it depends on where you see it in the second half i mean were thinking in the first quarter wed see a rate reduction so it probably if its in the fourth quarter youd probably wont see as much right because itd be like days or something like that days before you saw anything steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp i think what youre seeing here steve is that this is the deposit base catching up along with growth in our deposit base in part because of shoring up the balance sheet from a liquidity standpoint with things like interlink broker cds and stuff like that so thats really whats driving it and i think if youre thinking about it from a margin standpoint like i said before therell be some pressure in  because were ph holding whats excess cash which is the prudent thing to do but then as we get more clarity on the future in the next couple of quarters well manage that down and so youll see the margin come back up steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it perfect thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks steve operator operator instructions our next question comes from zach westerlind from ubs please go ahead your line is open webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc hi its zach on for brody my question is just around the basis points in chargeoffs could you provide any color on what loan categories drove that number john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp sure mostly commercial so if you think about our million million in credit chargeoffs in the quarter zach just to give you some because weve been talking about this the last several quarters about million of that were related to strategic loan sales about million in the quarter so obviously very very small discount on balance sheet optimization and proactive credit monitoring the rest of the million or so were all in about four commercial credits with actually i think four different business lines with no kind of correlated risk in terms of or anything that were seeing with respect to sector or industry or geography and that basis points annualized chargeoff rate is actually at or slightly below our prepandemic annualized chargeoff rate so we felt like it was another good quarter and i just wanted to give you that differentiation of the million of those chargeoffs that were done through proactive loan sales by us zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc understood thank you and then just one other quick one for me on the securities growth could you just provide if youre able to new purchase yields versus whats rolling off the book glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so i think when we purchased that it was a little over say somewhere around there and what came off was at about so theres about million that came off and about million that went on and in addition to that we had as i said in my prepared remarks about million in restructuring that we did so security sales effectively and those were at about or basis points zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc awesome thats it for me thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo please go ahead your line is open webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey guys good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey just looking at the quartertodate deposit growth can you give the composition of where you were seeing that i guess especially the contributions from brio and interlink and then to get to that higher terminal beta are you expecting higher contributions from brio and interlink than i guess you were assuming before glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so for the is your question about from the fourth quarter to the first quarter jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc well i guess both yeah and then what youve seen what you called out as seeing so far in april glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah yeah so interlink itself was for the first quarter was billion of the growth so basically thats from to billion so that was a big driver the offset to that was we let some of the broker deposits run off so they went from like billion to million right and then the other areas where we saw growth as i said in my prepared remarks were in like certificates of deposit that were up about billion and those were long dated a little over retail type of cds so thats how we ended the first quarter as i said in the prepared remarks were actually up in the second quarter by another billion and a big piece of that and i would say about million or million of that is interlink again and then the remainder is primarily brokered cds and our idea with that and theres some commercial growth as john indicated theres continued retail growth but in big chunks thats what it is and so that were using to pay down basically some fhlb borrowings and things like that so its sort of cost neutral from a nim standpoint and things like that but it also provides us more off balance sheet liquidity if you think of it that way and so we wanted to make sure we preserve the optionality of that and then the other dynamic as i said a few times is that were managing down cash and so you would expect to see our fhlb borrowings to come down the growth in interlink as we go through the year broker deposits will probably flatten out because i think we have other sources of funding that well get whether its briodirect or things like that so i think thats kind of how were thinking about it webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then when we just look at where these are on the balance sheet is interlink money market or i guess where were briodirect and interlink in terms of brokered cds glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah interlink jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc and money market glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so interlink is in money market but i would point you to our slide the slide presentation because we broke it out there so if you look on page of our presentation you can see the interlink piece so we sort of broke it out by product type and then by line of business and so you see in the corporate piece which is the treasury piece and john actually had it in his slide as well the net difference between interlink and whatever else is basically wholesale funding jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and just finally on interlink the cost of that for the quarter is that similar to fhlb i guess where is the cost on that indiscernible glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah its like fed funds its like fed funds plus jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you very much glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp sure john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you jared operator our
