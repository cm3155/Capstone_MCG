morning and welcome to webster financial corporations fourth quarter earnings call im going to provide remarks on our strategic execution high level results merger integration and strategic actions before turning it over to glenn to review our financials in more detail our strategy is straightforward and remains unchanged from the day we announced our merger in april of opportunistic and prudent growth in targeted areas where we have competitive differentiation while continuously enhancing a diverse and advantageous funding profile we continue to deploy capital and expense dollars into business activities that maximize shareholder returns and economic profit we are delivering on this strategy as a unified webster while at the same time executing on the integration of our merger with sterling we continue to exhibit solid credit performance and we are conservatively positioned in our capital levels and loan loss allowance the net results of executing on the strategic plan are evident in our performance this quarter on an adjusted basis we generated eps of versus last quarter and our ppnr grew quarteroverquarter or by million both our gaap and adjusted eps numbers are a quarterly record for webster underpinning our performance our net interest margin expanded basis points and loans grew over in the quarter with further moderate nim expansion and solid loan growth in our forecast with respect to our loan growth we again focused our origination activities in asset classes with stronger credit profiles such as public sector finance and fund banking for the fourth consecutive quarter the weighted average risk rating of our commercial originations were significantly stronger than that of the existing portfolio which is intentional when operating in a more uncertain macro environment we also enhanced our liquidity profile with the acquisition of interlink and we continue to have a solid capital position these results produced an adjusted roa of a return on tangible common equity of nearly and an efficiency ratio of all of these figures meet or exceed the pro forma metric targets we detailed at the time of our merger announcement while aided by a beneficial interest rate environment we are also delivering on our operational efficiencies growing loans in excess of our original targets and realizing new business opportunities from the merger we believe that our business can drive solid operating leverage and ppnr growth through a variety of macroeconomic operating environments and the interest rate backdrops and our goal is to generate consistent earnings and revenue growth throughout operating cycles we also feel confident that we can operate with an efficiency ratio in the low without sacrificing our ability to continue to invest in franchise enhancing and differentiated businesses in fact in  we invested several million dollars in expanding our commercial banking activities which should result in future growth over the coming years the strength of our franchise is also evident in our annual results which you can see on slide on a full year basis we grew our adjusted eps to from in the year prior and our return on tangible equity increased to we accomplished these results with a full year efficiency ratio of and postmerger loan growth of ahead of our to expectations webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 were certainly proud of the financial metrics achieved in the first year since merger closing but we may be even prouder of what weve accomplished from a culture and talent perspective we have an incredibly aligned and talented management team and a clearly defined valuesbased culture that is coming together ahead of our initial expectations one of the keys to our performance culture building and client retention as a company has been the consistency continuity and execution of our clientfacing colleagues among whom we have experienced virtually no loss of talent over the last two calendar years since deal announcement before turning it over to glenn i want to provide a brief overview of our acquisition of interlink which closed earlier this month and provides us with tremendous core funding optionality adding to what we believe is an already differentiated deposit funding profile deposits we access via interlink are considered core from a regulatory perspective have an extremely low cost of acquisition and thereby an attractive allin cost profile which works well in all rate scenarios and most importantly it can be scaled up or down relatively quickly according to our funding needs operationally interlink administers fdic insured deposit suite programs between broker dealers and banks such that broker dealers customers receive fdic insurance on idle cash balances in their account we currently administer around billion in deposit balances in the program a substantial portion of which webster could access over time theres a small portion of the deposits we would not access to ensure that customers in the program receive maximum fdic insurance coverage on their balances we collect a small fee on deposits that we do not hold on our balance sheet its only been two weeks since closing and weve already had great success with the program weve begun utilizing deposits on our balance sheet as a replacement for wholesale funding without changing our risk tolerances in terms of asset generation and weve signed up a brandnew broker dealer contract just last week were also excited about potential other revenue synergies with our broker dealer partners were pleased with our performance in the quarter excited about how were positioning the company for the future and confident in our ability to consistently deliver toptier financial performance as we take care of our clients our colleagues and our communities with that ill turn it over to glenn for the financial review glenn i macinnes chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thanks john and good morning everyone i will start with a reconciliation of core earnings on slide weve reported gaap net income to common shareholders of million with eps of on an adjusted basis we reported net income to common shareholders of million and eps of each of which exclude onetime aftertax expenses of million merger expenses were related to real estate consolidation severance and professional fees the strategic initiative expense is primarily repositioning of our securities portfolio next ill review balance sheet trends before moving on to the income statement on slide at period end total assets were billion with total loans of billion and total deposits of billion loan growth of billion was primarily driven by commercial banking which increased billion deposits were essentially flat quarteroverquarter i will provide additional detail for both on the next two slides slide highlights the diversity of our loan growth by category a great illustration of the breadth of our business lines in total we grew loans billion or on a linked quarter basis growth for the quarter was in the following verticals commercial real estate million fund banking million sponsor million and webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 residential mortgage million this was partially offset by lower mortgage warehouse lending of million quarteroverquarter the yield on the portfolio increased basis points and excluding accretion increased by basis points switching to deposits on slide total deposit balances were essentially flat from prior quarter this was the net result of a reduction in public funds which were down seasonally by billion and offset by wholesale deposits as we used a greater number of suite and other alternative sources of funds the total cost of deposits increased basis points to basis points from basis points prior quarter our effective beta was in the quarter and for the year beginning on slide i will review the details of our income statement we provided our reported to adjusted income statement by line item and compare our adjusted earnings to the third quarter net interest income grew by million or linked quarter driven by our origination volume and a higher rate environment the growth in net interest income drove meaningful improvement in ppnr net income and eps on an adjusted basis ppnr was up million or net income was up million or and eps was up or i will cover the individual line items in more detail on subsequent slides the net interest margin was up basis points on a reported basis and our efficiency ratio was down basis points from prior quarter on slide net interest income grew million relative to prior quarter adjusted for accretion in both periods net interest income was up million this was our third quarter of strong results driven by both loan growth and the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet excluding accretion the net interest margin increased basis points to and the earning asset yield was up basis points in the quarter as illustrated on the earlier slide the cost of deposits increased basis points quarteroverquarter we anticipate further deposit rate increases in the coming quarters and a throughthecycle cumulative beta of roughly excluding mix shift effect the mix shift effect from wholesale funding from interlink deposits on slide we highlight our fee income for the quarter on an adjusted basis fees were down million linked quarter the linked quarter decrease was driven primarily by the outsourcing of our consumer investment services platform as well as a number of smaller items and other fees the yearoveryear decline was a result of lower income in direct investment and mortgage banking fees as well as the outsourcing of our investment services slide summarizes noninterest expense we reported adjusted expense of million relative to prior quarter of million we continue to make progress on cost efficiencies related to the merger however this quarter included increased levels of performancebased compensation benefits expense and a strategic investment in commercial banking the yearoveryear increase of million is a combination of our cost save efforts todate offset by the increase in intangible amortization the bend acquisition and performancebased compensation slide highlights our allowance for credit losses which was up million over prior quarter after recording million in net chargeoffs we recorded million in provision expense with loan growth representing million of the increase and macro factors adding million slide highlights our key asset quality metrics on the upper left nonperforming assets declined million for prior quarter and represented basis points of loans likewise commercial classified loans declined million and represent basis points of total commercial loans net chargeoffs on the upper right totaled million or basis points of average loans on an annualized basis and the allowance coverage ratio remained flat periodoverperiod at basis points the allowance to nonperforming loan ratio increased to times up from webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 times last quarter coverage as a percent of commercial classified loans increased to from prior quarter our capital levels remain strong as illustrated on slide all capital ratios remain well in excess of regulatory and internal targets our common equity tier ratio was above the mediumterm operating target of the tangible common equity ratio was tangible book value per share increased to a share driven by our strong earnings growth ill wrap up my comments with our outlook on slide where we provide our fullyear projections our expectation for the rate curve is that the fed funds peak at in  and end the year basis points lower we expect loans to grow in the range of to with diverse growth across all business lines we expect deposits to grow to excluding the impact of interlink the acquisition of interlink provides flexibility in funding our forecasted loan growth given that and the structure of our balance sheet our fullyear outlook for net interest income excluding accretion is around billion on this slide you see the range of expected results we expect million in accretion that would be added to the net interest income outlook for those modeling net interest income on an fte basis i would add roughly million to the outlook fee income should be in the range of million to million which incorporates the full year impact of lower net fees from the outsourcing of our consumer investment services platform as well as lower derivative income as the range in our outlook illustrates core expenses are expected to be around billion to billion which will continue to result in an efficiency ratio in the range on capital our overall philosophy is unchanged as we approach our mediumterm operating target organic growth opportunities will likely occupy a greater share of capital deployment and were forecasting an effective tax rate of to with that ill turn it back over to john for closing remarks john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks a lot glenn were systematically executing on our merger integration and our core conversion timeline remains unchanged with final conversion targeted for the middle of this year weve continued to consolidate systems sitting on top of our core technology which enhances our colleagues capabilities and simplifies the conversion process as well as our operating processes weve also wrapped up our previously detailed corporate real estate consolidation while a tremendous amount of effort as you can imagine is going into ensuring a smooth systems conversion all of the business lines have turned the page and are functioning as a unified webster from an operating relationship management and client service perspective our strategic vision and values are integrated our operating structure is established and performing at a high level and across the bank we are focused on delivering for our clients overall was a terrific year for the bank our commercial loans grew for the full year we maintained a relatively low cost of funding as our transactional deposit balances including hsa deposits positioned us well for a higher rate environment and we should continue to benefit from a relatively lower cost of deposits in webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 we added to our technologyenabled businesses with the acquisition of bend at hsa bank and the announcement and subsequent close of the interlink transaction while also investing in digital enablement across the bank all of which enhances our differentiated funding profile during the year we repurchased million in stock enabled by our strong capital position and capital generation capability as we look forward for the rest of this year we understand that the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain however we are confident in our ability to generate solid operating results regardless of how the year plays out with respect to the economy our ability to operate a highly profitable company starts with our competitively differentiated business lines and our diversity of funding channels our efficient operating structure at efficiency and agile approach to our business and importantly very importantly prudent enterprise and credit risk management across our organization these attributes should allow us to generate industryleading results both in the near term and for years to come as we wrap up im sure most of you saw our announcement but i just want to highlight that will be holding our investor day on march in new york city where our talented management team will provide an extensive view of our disciplined approach to managing our business our goforward strategies and the significant opportunities for growth we have in front of us well also have an opportunity to do a deep dive on our loan portfolios enterprise and credit risk management frameworks and how we view our role importantly as a responsible communityfocused corporate citizen i look forward to seeing many of you there finally i want to thank all of our colleagues at webster the outstanding results we announced today are a direct result of their hard work and commitment to the culture and the focus on our clients operator glenn and i will open it up to questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and we will take our first question from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey john hey glenn i guess maybe a question on the interlink deal your stock has traded heavy over the past few weeks i think because of some concerns about liquidity and i think the quarter was very strong can you help us with just how you plan on using interlink and maybe it feels like arbitrage on the deposits just from a classification but what are the rates that are on these versus the borrowings you had in the quarter and just how much growth do you expect to put on the balance sheet thanks webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah glenn can give you some more detail on the cost of the deposits look it is interesting right weve gotten a lot of feedback some saying boy they had a liquidity issue they needed to beef up their liquidity on the other side concerns that we were going to take billion and generate and accelerate loan growth into an uncertain macro environment neither of those are the case chris we looked at this as a longterm opportunity from a position of strength to further enhance our optionality on funding sources so if you look at us even in a quarter like this quarter where we had seasonally low government deposits and we havent yet seen the first quarter inflow of hsa deposits our loan to deposit ratio even after billion of loan growth still comfortably in the low and in the first quarter were going to see million or million of hsa deposits flow in well have government seasonality work to our advantage so were not constrained at all from a growth perspective and a funding perspective but we looked at this as an opportunity to give us in terms of our three to five year plan optionality around how we can fund our growth with core deposits and it can replace wholesale funding it can help us if we do have acceleration of loan growth when we get the all clear from the economic environment it can help us there as well so we looked at this as a really opportunistic acquisition for us and we think when you add it to ph briodirect bank and you add it to hsa and you add it to our sticky core retail deposits and our commercial deposits and our government deposits were in a position now where we continue to build out this really diversified and broad funding source and we think this is a really good addition glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah and chris i would just add if you think about it from a cost standpoint fhlb if i use it as a proxy were paying about i think for the quarter we were like for million allin on fhlb and this is probably a product that has its priced at like fed funds plus million to million so really its just moving the geography of our funding and actually increasing our core funding ability christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful thank you maybe on credit last quarter you moved off roughly billion which i dont know got enough attention of riskier credits can you just john make a comment or two on how youre feeling about certain portfolios obviously the sponsor book gets a lot of attention and also remind us your acl is but do you have that stat with the marks thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah no i think all really good points obviously thats right the focus of everyone following the industry is what were going to see here from an economic perspective and what the impacts are going to be on credit so far again obviously were pretty pleased with where we are we interestingly saw npas come down and classifieds come down both on a real dollar basis and on a percentage of portfolio basis i did make the comment around the quality of our originations were being very thoughtful around trying to avoid cyclical businesses and stick to our knitting in areas where we think theres a lot of resiliency from a we did shed about billion strategically and i think that was a really good call just in terms of the way the markets continued to move in the third quarter chris we didnt have any material moves like that in webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 terms of portfolio sales in the fourth quarter our chargeoffs which are lower than prior quarter do include some losses taken on sale of loans not loans that have gone through a foreclosure process but again being proactive a couple of office deals are in the four or five commercial charges that we took that make up the million so were still being really proactive from a balance sheet management perspective and as we mentioned last quarter when we as we look into we are kind of right now currently evaluating all of our commercial niche businesses to see whether weve got some businesses that are subscale or are there portfolios that were concerned about we didnt take any material actions in the fourth quarter and right now quite frankly we dont see any urgency in terms of deteriorating credit performance more broadly and i dont want to ramble on forever but more broadly were still focused on office because we think not only does the economic environment impacted but as you probably talk to all the companies you cover people are just concerned about the paradigm shift there and so we still are in a pretty good position in terms of risk ratings there rent rolls classified so were not at all panicked were focused on it a lot but also really focused on all of our risk selection moving forward so pleased with where we are now we havent really seen the deterioration i think that people across the industry would have anticipated i think the whole industry is feeling that way but were certainly being more proactive in how we manage our balance sheet how we select onboarding credits making sure were doing more frequent and deep portfolio dives on what we have in our book right now christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just if i could you mentioned office do you can you provide the updated exposure anything on watch classified nonaccrual any trends there thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp sure our classifieds are down a little bit let me pull up i think were about billion in total office exposure now and when i say total office exposure its kind of traditional white collar its not including the medical office which as you know is performing really well across the board anyway and so i think our lets see yeah weve had a slight decline in classified some of that probably have to do with the fact that weve been lightning up on the portfolio but again we havent seen any material deterioration in the portfolio and what weve been doing is kind of selecting those class b and class c office loans which represent about half of that billion weve been kind of looking at them and trying to think about whether or not there is particular vulnerability and then seeing whether or not we can exit those credits kind of before maturity and so i think i would characterize it as weve come down from billion through actions were at billion its about class a and class b c and weve seen sort of stabilization in the general credit characteristics of that portfolio but we still are like everyone else concerned about the longterm nature of that asset class christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks john john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 thanks chris operator and we will take our next question from mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler your line is open mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp hey mark john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey mark how are you doing mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co good thanks just a quick followup on the office portfolio stuff of the billion is most of that in metro boston metro new york john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp it is not i would say yes theres probably about half mark actually thats not true hang on latest stat i have about of our office exposure is five boroughs mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and the boston portfolio is relatively small downtown boston john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i would say probably to of the portfolio mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co and if you looked at the average ltvs on that book and at origination what do those look like john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah the weighted average ltv the last time we updated this at the end of the third quarter we were about weighted average ltv and im actually reading this as we go through right our criticized and classifieds have gone down from about to and i said that improvements probably also because weve lowered the overall amount of the portfolio so pretty decent stability mark right now but as i said we continue to watch that like the rest of the industry does webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then i wondered if you could share with us how the renewal season in the hsa business is shaping up i thought i heard you say million or million of new hsa deposits coming in did i hear that right john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah sure you did and i know we historically have always answered this question in this earnings call by saying well be able to provide you more confident and detailed information when the first quarters done but i can tell you this it looks like were a couple of percentage points higher than the last enrollment seasons growth i think we expect about new accounts to come in in the first quarter and were maybe of the way there which is kind of slightly ahead of where we were last year and as i mentioned the expectation is for million or million its always harder to predict the deposits because of initial deposits and then the new accounts how the funding works and whether or not there is any attrition in those numbers but i think thats good enough to give you a comfort level as to what we feel were going to achieve and then obviously in the first quarter and at investor day well give you a deep dive and well tell you exactly where we are mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then lastly glenn i wondered if you could share any thoughts on the outlook for the provision over the next quarter or two glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so were at million as we reported in the quarter its been basically flat were at the top quartile of our peer group so we feel really good about that i think it will be impacted by loan growth as we go over the next couple of quarters but more importantly the macro environment and thats where the challenge is and so you saw we did build in the quarter and that was there was about million of build that was related to the macro environment so its hard for me to handicap but i think our coverage ratio could drift up if we do see us going into a light or a slowdown in the economy but thats about all i can tell you right now mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks mark operator and we will take our next question from matthew breese with stephens your line is open webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i wanted to touch on the nii outlook the core nii outlook it looks like its it averages about million for the quarter but as you alluded to theres going to be some the fed funds are going to go higher and then potentially get some cuts towards the back half of the year so i was hoping to get an idea of cadence and where we might see kind of the yearend nii glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah good ill take that so matt i think look if we look at it these numbers are exaccretion right so if you think about our fourth quarter exaccretion and i would probably say that by year end we end in the range of like the mid3 so going into the first quarter its sort of tapered by two less days but then we start getting a little bit of expansion over the next couple of quarters and thats a sum of a lot of factors obviously its it is we do think this is based on a forecast where fed funds peaks in the second quarter of then comes down by the end of the year like i said basis points so theres that theres the loan origination volume theres an assumption on data but thats where we ended up matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and mid3 just to clarify youre alluding to the core nim glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah yes core nim excluding accretion matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay going back to hsa so a couple of days ago we received the pricing on a million book of hsa deposits sold in november looked like its sold for a near deposit premium given the size of your book and the current valuation of the overall company it certainly doesnt feel like youre getting that kind of valuation recognition with that in mind i would love your thoughts on the underlying value of hsa and how to either better showcase it within webster or get your thoughts on potentially achieving it elsewhere john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thats a great question matt and it brings back to days when we answered this question more frequently look i would agree with you right now that just in terms of the overhang in the banking industry and valuations of bank stocks right its hard to kind of do a sum of the parts valuation and see that youre getting full value for webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 differentiated assets no matter who you are and what you own right now just given concerns about credit and interest rates we have said over and over again we continuously evaluate the hsa business and we continue to come from a pure economic profit perspective to the conclusion that our advantage of owning and wholly owning that business and our ability to deploy lowcost longduration deposits into the growth of our business and holistic relationships creates the most value over the long term and what youve seen here is throughout interest rate cycles you have seen us start to get recognition for having that business because of its unique growth trajectory the fees it generates and importantly the long duration sticky lowcost deposits the deposit cost in that business went from basis points to something like basis points this quarter thats still below our 10year average rate of what those cost of deposits are so we do believe that as we get more clarity just in terms of the economy that people realize the differentiation and it should grow faster than our other deposit channels just by its general nature and again become more of a contributor to the overall funding profile that people will start once again to recognize the power of that business both from a funding perspective and a growth perspective so i think your observation is correct i think we obviously we have a duty as stewards of capital in all our businesses to constantly look at the value and where are our assets and where are the things we own are most valuable and we continue to be determined that it will continue to provide value to bank shareholders the shareholders of webster bank and that owning it wholly right now is absolutely the best creation of value that we could have with hsa matthew breese q analyst stephens inc thank you i appreciate that two other ones for me the first one was just past dues there was a bit of a pickup in commercial real estate and abl loans curious what was going on there and if theres any sort of progress towards npa or maybe payoff john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah its a great question and actually i can i always am transparent im frustrated that that was the case they went up basically about million in reported delinquencies we have since the end of the year resolved more than the increase in delinquencies so if you looked at it those were all administrative delinquencies meaning we couldnt get the documents together and get the extensions or the payoffs or the restructurings or whatever they were off the books they were all paying and current and at the end of the day were now down to million million in delinquencies so that entire spike was really due to administrative delinquencies that since yearend have been resolved matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great i appreciate that and then the last one on the sponsor and specialty and leveraged loan portfolio i frequently go back to the first quarter of your presentation there where you laid out some really fantastic metrics across the entire book i was hoping for an update on a couple of them including leverage ratios cumulative chargeoffs nonperformance at this point in time and then loantovalue ratios if you have them handy webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp matt im going to defer that to our investor day were putting together all of our current numbers as of yearend to provide a really deep dive what i can tell you is that you have not we have not seen the significant risk rating migration we have certainly not seen a material loss in that portfolio we have again our i think to give you the answer that i can best give you right now is were seeing the same thing that weve seen in periods of uncertainty which is were in industries that seem to be more recession resilient with more predictable and contractual cash flows thats a general characteristic of the portfolio we deal with sponsors that we know and love and have spent a lot of time with and even if revenues have been challenged or even if valuations and enterprise valuations have been sort of revisited were in a position where the capital structure and our position in that capital structure is such that no one is close to wanting to hand us the keys and both us and the sponsors that we work with just make sure that we continue to evaluate opportunities and we continue to support each other going through so we have not seen significant migration we have not seen people deciding that the operating environment is too challenging and weve been pleased that in areas like healthcare and areas like technology and the places where we focus our sponsor and specialty activities weve seen pretty good resiliency from the portfolio so far that doesnt mean right that higher interest rates dont matter on debt service particularly if revenues are getting squeezed so were on top of the portfolio working closely with our sponsors and you can rest assured that on march we will update all the information and give you a really good deep dive on what that portfolio looks like as of yearend matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great well i appreciate you taking all my questions thank you very much operator operator instructions and we will take our next question from casey haire with jefferies your line is open casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yes thanks good morning everyone apologies if i missed this glenn any thoughts on what deposit beta cumulative deposit beta expectation is underlying this nii glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah yes sure so i did say casey if you missed it our legal since legal day one our cumulative deposit beta is quarter over that means quarteroverquarter our deposit beta was we think given our rate outlook meaning fed funds peak at and then drop by basis points by the end of the year that our cumulative throughthecycle beta will be around and i should point out that hsa since weve talked about hsa benefit that by about so the lowcost long duration nature of hsa deposits certainly benefits us there too webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc excellent thank you and then another followup on interlink first off can you disclose how much you have used since the deal closed earlier this month and then two one of the applications this that you guys have spoken to is like your forecast calls for fed cuts and using this funding vehicle to build the bond book would be a very nice way to kind of increase liability sensitivity ahead of a fed pivot so just wondering how glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah casey haire q analyst jefferies llc youre thinking about that as an application glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so let me hit a few and ill flip it over to john so first off the betas that i gave you are on our they exclude interlink because were at the beginning of this and so therell be some puts and takes to that as we decide whether to leverage the optionality that interlink provides or not todate i mean and this is as of two weeks close we have about million in deposits and paying off things first is the first tranche paying off some of our fhlb and i talked about the pricing dynamics of that to basically just a wash from a standpoint but it does provide us with core deposits and then going forward to your point we do have the optionality to pay off some future fhlb borrowings or to invest in securities so thats an option that were looking at going forward but i dont know if you want to john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i mean casey i think the last point you made thank you for making it i agree i mean we were traditionally right you heard me in my comments our committed desire to have more consistency in earnings given our asset sensitivity right and so weve been spending a lot of time on that this does provide different optionality yes on its face the cost of these deposits is fed funds and but obviously in a lower interest rate environment it does give us some opportunity to take advantages as the cost of those funds come down and we can deploy them into securities or deploy them into loans it as i said in the very beginning we looked at this and said given the opportunity given our position of strength and where we are and the fact that we really love our funding profile already wouldnt this great be great to have another tool in the tool kit to deploy in various interest rate scenarios in various asset growth scenarios in terms of seasonality and inflows and outflows of other deposits and potential other business opportunities with the broker dealers so i think your point is a very very good one and the answer would be yes casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got it great and then just one more on the expense side of things so the guide if i look at your run rate here in the fourth quarter youre kind of at the middle point of your guide webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah casey haire q analyst jefferies llc and youve got that conversion coming midyear john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah casey haire q analyst jefferies llc so there could be some leverage in the back half as you recognize some of the cost saves just where are we in terms of realization of those cost saves and i guess what can the expense run rate exit the year at in the fourth quarter john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp casey im going to let glenn give you the specifics i do want to make a strategic comment on expenses right i mean obviously what weve been able to do and again we can go into more depth obviously there are significant synergies related to this merger some of which we have already realized others that we still have to come including as you said million to million related to ultimate end state after technology conversion we also have said and ive said all along in terms of managing the businesses that this allows us to invest were operating at a efficiency ratio if you look at the guidance the efficiency ratio could go have a three handle on it at some point and our goal is to operate a really robust and resilient bank that has franchise value and the ability to continue to invest in differentiated businesses and drive high ph roatc and roa and i think were demonstrating that so just from a topofthehouse perspective we also look at the synergies not only to get to our lowest core run rate in expenses but to offset our ability and to not have increase in expenses while were continuing to invest glenn talked about million in commercial banking and hsa investments related to bend teams and some other initiatives that well talk about again more at investor day were able to do that without increasing our efficiency ratio significantly because we continue to look at the synergies that come out of the merger i would also comment that weve been very deliberate in terms of things like reducing square footage in the banking centers i think we were one of the only moes not to have a bunch of the economics predicated on taking out branches we havent closed any branches since the except for at a lease expiration maybe a oneoff or two off but weve had no reduction in square footage in our branch footprint obviously as weve talked about over time and the industry knows therell be opportunities to reduce square footage we want to make sure we get through the conversion take care of our customers but we have levers like that to pull as well to accelerate expense reductions over the longer term webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 so i wanted to give you just kind of my thoughts about the fact that were not managing quarterbyquarter that we think weve got a unique opportunity to continue to invest in key businesses and that the synergies underlying that will allow us not to have significant growth in expenses where many of our peers are seeing inflationary pressures and growth in expenses and then over time we do have more levers to pull should the revenue tailwinds kind of slow we look at our branch footprint and look at other potential cost saves we have and levers to pull glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah hey casey i would just add look our core expenses on a pro forma basis i think are about billion for and our guidance would suggest that we have an increase of to so thats anywhere from million to million and as john indicated whether its fdic cost going up million or whether its the investment in bend the investment in commercial business were pretty much offsetting the bulk of those through vendor fte redundancy all tied to the merger of equals so we feel really good about our expense projections at this point casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator we will take our next question from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is open alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning this is alex lau on for steve john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks alex say hi to steve for us alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc will do my first question is on dda deposits can you talk about your expectations for dda deposit outflows what are you hearing from your customers and what do you think is considered a more normal operating level and maybe as a reference point prepandemic you were about of total deposits this is excluding sterling do you expect to go back to that level or what is a more realistic mix going forward john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp so i think were running about of total deposits on dda right and i think on an average quarterover quarter basis there wasnt that much deterioration a couple maybe a couple of hundred million on a spot basis it was probably down i think about some of that is the municipal deposits that i talked about so youll webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 see some seasonality come back into that as well so i think as we looked out on a full year forecast we think its going to be in that range say to of total deposits which given our deposit outlook would indicate some growth alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you and then just a followup question on nim what are your spot loan yields as of relative to that for the average for the quarter glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp for the quarter our spot loan yields were let me see hold on just a minute alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you thanks for taking my question guys glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp all right alex thanks operator and we will take our next question from jared shaw with wells fargo securities your line is open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc audio gap everybody thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey maybe just following up on that whats the spot deposit cost glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp sure jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 at yearend as well glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp basis points jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then maybe just a little detail on the securities repositioning how much you sold what you glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc what you sort of picked up in terms of duration are you extending duration there and if you have aoc at the end of the year glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so it was relatively small jared we sold about million of securities and i think the earn back on that is probably it s less than a year and it was primarily munis sort of and weve repurchased the ginnie mae project so the yield on that so weve gone from like a rate to like a somewhere around there on that so and the duration was about years on it so it was a small amount of million as we think about asset sensitivity were looking more at that were looking weve done some collars were also looking at loan swaps and stuff like that and so there is we think its probably the right time given the asset sensitivity in our view on rates that we begin to take and protect on the downside a little bit more so these are some of the actions that were taking jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good and then whats the aoci at the end of the year glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so the aoci actually came back to us a little bit on a capital basis i think we had an improvement of about million aftertax so it actually we went from an aftertax of million to an aftertax of million so thats starting to accrete back into our capital its kind of tied to the fiveyear and think about it that way jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay and then just looking at loan growth in your comments that with the more broadly uncertain economic backdrop thats tampering it a little bit to is still pretty good where do you think it would be if webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 you werent holding yourself back based on economic uncertainty and i guess where do you think that could go in a better backdrop john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah jared thats a great question right and i always have a tough time answering it because i feel like weve said again and ive been pretty proud of this for seven or eight years right that we can grow commercial loans to and weve done that throughout different cycles and throughout different general circumstances loan demand economic environments and weve also said that were never going to try and grow loans at all if there is no safe loans that have the right risk return characteristics or that we feel comfortable about from a risk perspective and i think over time we had outsized loan growth to our original forecast there was i think market concern about whether or not as a bigger organization we could generate that and then obviously we did we talked about higher hold levels being able to take better risk with higher quality credits and higher hold levels i think everything we talked about in getting to our commercial loan growth in the year kind of played out and came true and we were disciplined we do we werent going for loan growth for loan growths sake where you can see areas like mortgage warehouse that are less relationshipdriven didnt really drive loan growth where we have loan growth were getting deposits were doing it in commercial real estate in multifamily and mixed use industrial right were not doing office were being careful about the asset classes were in were taking care of our geographic middle market clients were being careful in sponsor and were moving forward so i think the to if i could make it sort of as plain as possible is probably our general assumption that its to but understanding that this is a choppier year right and understanding that there may be less loan demand given economic growth characteristics and we want to be really careful so when you asked and said what would it be if we werent in this environment again i think we can safely and predictably as a bank grow loans to year in and year out i think youre seeing a little discount to that general guidance just because it would be prudent to put that out there given the economic uncertainty and concerns about risk return characteristics and quality of credit jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator and we will take our next question from manan gosalia with morgan stanley your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to ask on repricing expectations on the loan book can you talk about how spreads are holding up in the commercial portfolios just general competitive dynamics and what runway you have for loan repricing if the fed pauses data this quarter john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp great are you asking more about the competitive landscape on loan spreads or the impact of our floating rate portfolio and asset sensitivity and what happens when rates fall manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc the former john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp the former yeah so from a competitive perspective its interesting i actually read a couple of other my our peers and big bank transcripts i think everybody is seeing the same thing which is there is slightly less competition just given the macro environment the nonbank lenders that have been competing with the banks are less aggressive and active given cost of funding and other elements so i would say spreads that had been continuing to narrow over time during periods of high growth have kind of stabilized so from a competitive perspective i do feel that the regulated banking industry has a little bit more leverage in making sure they are getting paid for risk so i think weve seen rates kind of stabilize to slightly expand given the credit environment and then obviously the fact that we have a large floating rate book allows us in this interest rate environment to have higher yields on our loans but the underlying credit spreads i think i would say are stable to slightly improving manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thats helpful and then just a followup on interlink i think you mentioned that there are other revenue synergies you have with your broker partners can you talk about what those synergies are and what the timing of those synergies would be john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah again nothing is factored into our forward forecast but we have opportunities with respect to banking services and crosssell with the broker dealers we have opportunities potentially with hsa bank and investment platforms with the bds securities lending activities so there are a number of things that were exploring nothing is in our guidance so it would all be kind of upside to kind of the revenue and fee guidance that we provided webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 and again i think one of the focuses were going to have on march and i hope you can be there will be a look at a number of revenue synergies coming from the merger and from some of these acquisitions like bend and interlink so well provide a little bit more meat on the bone there but there are significant opportunities and weve already engaged with our partners there in discussing some of the potential opportunities we have manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc perfect i look forward to it thank you operator and we will take our next question from laurie hunsicker with compass point your line is open laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc great hi thanks good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey laurie laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc three unrelated questions here number one just going back to interlink if im looking at slide your forward guide how much are you assuming in interlink deposits that you actually pulled down this year in glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so like i said right now we have about million in the first quarter and i think you could expect billion to billion in the first quarter and then it to grow a couple of billion each quarter again that will depend on the optionality so i think the highest we would assume in our outlook right there is billion to billion by yearend but again we will monitor that and have optionality laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc got you okay thanks and your drop in wealth management revenues this quarter can you talk a little bit about how we should think about that glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so we announced i think on the third quarter call that we had outsourced our webster investment services which is our retail platform to lpl and so what you see there laurie is a netting of the fees with the expenses and so its generally around million to million reduction in fees as a result of lower expenses laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc got it okay perfect webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah so laurie we used to when we own that right we used to recognize gross revenue and we used to recognize all expenses the sterling model was an outsourced where there is a net fee of those two we did a lot of examination in terms of client satisfaction and where we are from an economic perspective and it made sense for us to adopt the legacy sterling model and so now we report lower overall fee revenue but significantly overall lower expenses there as well the actual net is slightly better from an economic perspective than where we are but that does not indicate any change in kind of the trajectory of the underlying business laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc got it perfect thanks for the refresh there and then last question office did you have any office sales this quarter and then your million or so of net commercial chargeoffs how much of that if any was office thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah so again were what was wonderful is our net chargeoff number on an annualized basis is kind of consistent with our prepandemic fouryear running average rate and in that to your point there are some as i mentioned on an earlier question there were a couple of proactive note sales that contributed so we had in our consumer business we had net neutral to net recovery all the chargeoffs were basically driven by four or five commercial credits two or three of which laurie were officerelated aggregating somewhere in the million range and two of those three office credits were proactive note sales and so thats about as granular as ill get there and again i think we feel pretty good about the way were proactively managing that book within and the sort of ultimate results from some of the asset sales weve gotten there are going to benefit us going forward laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc great thanks for taking my question john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp you got it have a great day operator and we will take our next question from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning everyone thanks for hanging on till the end john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp of course webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah just a few cleanups glenn anything else to call out on the fee expectations guidance anything new there is it just simple as pull out the losses and continue the path that you had in the fourth quarter glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp on the fee income line jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah fee income line and the fee income guidance glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so the guidance of million to million is that what youre talking about looking at jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes exactly glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp no i mean i think we just talked about part of that is part of a decline yearoveryear million or whatever is about half of that is the netting of the consumer investment platform we dont think that well get the swap income that we got last year obviously because of higher rates and then we did we have factored in lower deposit fees due to consumer behavior industry pricing and things like on hsa jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good fair enough glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp and on a gaap basis im sorry on a gaap basis for fourth quarter obviously you have that securities loss of million as well jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so that will be as we review the securities portfolio well spike that out obviously but if we take more actions that could influence that number on a gaap basis webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then on interlink is there a size limit you are thinking about in terms of deposits on your balance sheet and do you plan to report it separately like youre doing on slide john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah well absolutely provide that again the great thing about it is accordion feature where there is an automatic distribution valve in terms of whether we need the liquidity and its optimal for us i think just like we had the questions over years around hsa whats the right number we always got questions about whether the regulators care that hsa was becoming to of our deposits i think well use the same prudent risk management and we have so many different deposit channels when you think about retail commercial small business briodirect which is our direct channel hsa bank and now interlink that i think will just be prudent to make sure that there is not too much of a concentration but if you look at what glenn just said about and what weve mentioned earlier the opportunity even if billion or billion could be available to us it doesnt really represent a concentration going given the overall core funding deposit profile so i think its going to be less about us setting an artificial limit and more about do we have used an opportunity to deploy those deposits glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah and jon we have about billion in fhlb fundings at quarter end and theyre basically at million and so the pricing is pretty much very similar to interlink and so all if you think about on that perspective you can pay a bulk of that down and gain the core deposits at the same time right and then you have further optionality whether its the securities portfolio or things like that so it provides a significant amount of optionality for us we dont have to take i think i answered one of the questions that we could have up to billion or somewhere around there by yearend but thats an option for us right jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats a good slide slide i like that john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp well keep it in jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great and then on expenses you may not answer this you may have answered it already but you mentioned some expenses on expanding commercial activities and is that what you talked about sharing on investor day is there something more that you can talk about now in terms of that webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2023 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i mean there is nothing hidden right its new verticals its hiring teams and people there are a couple of new potential business initiatives that were viewing right now so its what youd expect and what youve actually quite frankly seen webster entirely and both of the legacy organizations that form this new bank do over time which is to continue to take advantage of opportunities in areas where we can get full relationships with deposits capital markets fees cash management and look at geographies asset classes and verticals and invest in those and i think id like to say that weve done it with success over time and i think we will share more at investor day but its not a top secret its about building out and kind of replicating what weve done in the past with respect to expanding activities jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thank you for everything glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thanks jon john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator and with no further questions i will now turn the call back to mr john ciulla for closing remarks john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster
