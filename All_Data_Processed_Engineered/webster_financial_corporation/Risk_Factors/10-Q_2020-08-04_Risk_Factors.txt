remote locations from home increases in requests for forbearance and loan modifications and additional health and safety precautions implemented at all physical locations to the extent that commercial and social restrictions remain in place or increase our delinquencies foreclosures and credit losses may materially increase and we could experience reductions in fee income as transaction volumes decline unfavorable economic conditions may also make it more difficult for us to maintain deposit levels and loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing furthermore such conditions have and may continue to cause the value of collateral associated with our existing loans to decline the persistence or worsening of current economic conditions could also adversely affect certain risks related to our accounting estimates as described within the use of estimates section of managements discussion and analysis within this document in addition in march the federal reserve lowered

availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business the business and operations of our thirdparty service providers who perform critical services for our business or the businesses of many of our customers and borrowers in addition as a result of the pandemic and the related increase in remote working by our personnel and the personnel of other companies the risk of cyberattacks breaches or similar events whether through our systems or those of third parties on which we rely has increased among the factors outside our control that are likely to affect the impact the covid19

longerterm shifts toward mobile banking telecommuting and telecommerce and geographic variation in the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic including in states in which we operate physically such as connecticut new york massachusetts rhode island and wisconsin the ongoing covid19 pandemic has resulted in severe volatility in the financial markets and meaningfully lower stock prices for many companies including our common stock depending on the extent and duration of the covid19 pandemic the price of our common stock may continue to experience volatility and declines we are continuing to monitor the covid19 pandemic and related risks although the rapid development and fluidity of the situation precludes any specific prediction as to its ultimate impact on us however if the pandemic continues to spread or otherwise result in a continuation or worsening of the current economic and commercial environments our business financial condition results of operations and cash
