item risk factors investment in our securities involves risks and uncertainties some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our business the discussion below addresses the material risks and uncertainties of which we are currently aware that could adversely affect our business and impact results of operations or financial condition before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks factors actually occurs our business results of operations or financial condition could be harmed as a result risks relating to the economy financial markets and interest rates difficult conditions in the economy and the financial markets may have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the united states as a whole unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth decreases in business activity weakening of investor or business confidence limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital increases in inflation changes in interest rates changes in laws high unemployment national and international political turmoil the imposition of tariffs on trade natural disasters or a combination of these or other factors in particular we may face the following risks in connection with developments in the current economic and market environment consumer and business confidence levels may decline and lead to less credit usage and increases in delinquencies and default rates our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select manage and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors customer desire to do business with us may decline whether as a result of a decreased demand for loans or other financial products and services or decreased deposits or other investments in accounts with us competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the continued consolidation of financial services companies and changes in financial services technologies and the effects of recent and proposed changes in laws the business environment and financial markets in the us have experienced volatility in recent years and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that economic conditions will not worsen difficult economic conditions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition changes in local economic conditions could adversely affect our business a significant percentage of our loans are secured by real estate primarily across the northeast our success depends in part upon economic conditions in southern new england and our other geographic markets adverse changes in such local markets could reduce our growth in loans and deposits impair our ability to collect our loans increase problem loans and chargesoffs and otherwise negatively affect our performance and financial condition the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect our business our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services companies or the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations we may not pay dividends if we are not able to receive dividends from our subsidiary webster bank we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries and depend on the payment of cash dividends from webster bank and our existing liquid assets as the principal sources of funds for paying cash dividends on our common stock unless we receive dividends from webster bank or choose to use our liquid assets we may not be able to pay dividends webster banks ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements see the subsection captioned dividends in item of this report for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations changes in interest rates and spreads could have an impact on earnings and financial condition which could have a negative impact on the value of our stock our consolidated earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings the narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition we cannot predict with certainty or control changes in interest rates regional and local economic conditions and the policies of regulatory authorities including monetary policies of the frb affect interest income and interest expense while we have ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability for example high interest rates could affect the amount of loans that we can originate because higher rates could cause customers to apply for fewer mortgages cause depositors to shift funds from accounts that have a comparatively lower cost to accounts with a higher cost or cause us to experience customer attrition due to competitor pricing if the cost of interestbearing deposits increases at a rate greater than the yields on interestearning assets increase net interest income will be negatively affected changes in the asset and liability mix may also affect net interest income similarly lower interest rates cause higher yielding assets to prepay and floating or adjustable rate assets to reset to lower rates if we were not able to reduce our funding costs sufficiently due to either competitive factors or the maturity schedule of existing liabilities then our net interest margin would decline the uncertainty about the future of london interbank offered rate libor may adversely impact our business the united kingdom financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor has announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after which may result in the use of libor in financial contracts being phased out by the end of the alternative reference rates committee arrc has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate sofr represents best practice as the alternative to libor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to libor arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor it is not possible at this time to predict what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for liborindexed financial instruments the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate such as sofr is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our loan and lease and investment portfolios assetliability management business financial condition and results of operations webster has interest rate swap agreements and other instruments that are indexed to libor and is currently monitoring and evaluating this activity and the related risks our stock price can be volatile stock price volatility may negatively impact the price at which our common stock may be sold and may also negatively impact the timing of any sale our stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors among other things actual or anticipated variations in operating results changes in recommendations by securities analysts operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us news reports relating to trends concerns and other issues in the financial services and healthcare industries new technology used or services offered by competitors perceptions in the marketplace regarding us andor our competitors significant acquisitions or business combinations strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions additional investments from third parties issuance of additional shares of stock changes in government regulations or actions by government regulators and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts general market fluctuations industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes credit loss trends or currency fluctuations could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results regulatory compliance environmental and legal risks we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision which may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and may negatively impact our financial results we primarily through webster bank and certain nonbank subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision banking regulations are intended to protect depositors funds the dif and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole not shareholders these regulations affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy and growth among other things congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products we may offer andor limit what we may charge for certain banking services among other things additionally recent changes to the legal and regulatory framework governing our operation including the continued implementation of doddfrank and egrrcpa have and will continue to affect the lending investment trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies doddfrank imposed additional regulatory obligations and increased scrutiny from federal banking agencies in general we expect this focus to continue and compliance requirements can be costly to implement compliance personnel and resources may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur see the section captioned supervision and regulation in item of this report for further information changes in accounting standards and policies could materially impact how we report our results of operations and financial condition our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition accordingly we exercise judgment in selecting and applying these accounting policies and methods so they comply with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the financial accounting standards board fasb regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements additionally those bodies may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied the impact of these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we report our results of operations and financial condition we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively which may result in the revision of prior period financial statements by material amounts such changes could also require the company to incur additional personnel technology or other costs for example under cecl the new accounting standard on credit losses which became effective for us on january credit losses on loans and heldtomaturity securities and other financial assets carried at amortized cost will be required to be recognized earlier than in the past the cecl methodology requires that expected lifetime credit losses be recorded at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired with adjustments each period to the extent the estimate for expected lifetime credit losses have changed the cecl methodology replaces the existing impairment models under gaap that generally require that a loss be incurred before it is recognized a discussion of accounting standards recently adopted and issued but not yet adopted including cecl can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements health care reforms could adversely affect our hsa bank division revenues financial position and results of operations the enactment of health care reforms affecting health savings accounts at the federal or state level may affect our hsa bank division which is a bank custodian of health savings accounts we cannot predict if any such reforms will ultimately become law or if enacted what their terms or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such laws will be any health care reforms enacted may be phased in over a number of years but if enacted could with respect to the operations of our hsa bank reduce revenues increase costs and require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business in addition our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by such changes changes in the federal state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance we are subject to changes in tax law that could increase our effective tax rates while the tax cuts and jobs act of tax act reduced the federal corporate tax rate from to beginning in which has had a favorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities the new legislation also enacted limitations on certain deductions such as fdic deposit insurance premiums which partially offset the increase in net earnings from the lower tax rate in addition further changes in the tax law changes in interpretations guidance or regulations that may be promulgated or actions that we may take as a result of the tax act could negatively impact our business similarly our customers are likely to continue to experience varying effects from both the individual and business tax provisions of the tax act and such effects whether positive or negative may have a corresponding impact on our financial performance and the economy as a whole we are subject to financial and reputational risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits the nature of our business ordinarily results in a certain amount of claims and legal action whether claims and related legal actions are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect our market perception the products and services we offer as well as impact customer demand for those products and services we assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings as well as certain threatened claims utilizing the latest and most reliable information for matters where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated no accrual is established for matters where it is probable we will incur a loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated we establish an accrual for the loss once established the accrual is adjusted periodically to reflect any relevant developments the actual cost of any outstanding legal proceedings or threatened claims however may turn out to be substantially higher than the amount accrued these costs may adversely affect our business results of operations and prospects we are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we obtain title a large portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate in the course of our business we may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties we may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage personal injury investigation and cleanup costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property the costs associated with investigation and remediation activities could be substantial in addition if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property these costs and claims could adversely affect our business results of operations and prospects risks relating to business environment and operations we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area if we fail to compete effectively our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than we do such competitors primarily include national regional and community banks within the various markets in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings and loans credit unions nonbank health savings account trustees finance companies brokerage firms insurance companies online lenders factoring companies and other financial intermediaries some of the financial services organizations with which the company competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured depository institutions which may give them certain advantages over the company in accessing funding and in providing various services the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks additionally due to their size many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and as a result may offer a broader range of products and services than we do as well as better pricing for those products and services our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things the ability to develop maintain and build upon longterm customer relationships based on top quality service high ethical standards and safe sound assets the ability to expand market position the scope relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors customer satisfaction with our level of service and products and industry and general economic trends failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the loss of key partnerships could adversely affect our hsa bank division our hsa bank division relies on partnerships with various health insurance carriers and other partners to maximize our distribution model in particular health plan partners who provide high deductible health plan options are a significant source of new and existing health savings account holders if these health plan partners or other partners choose to align with our competitors our results of operations business and prospects could be adversely affected we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or retain them the unexpected loss of services of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the business as we would lose their skills knowledge of the market and years of industry experience and may have difficulty promptly finding qualified replacement personnel we continually encounter technological change the failure to understand and adapt to these changes could negatively impact our business financial services industries continually experience rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services an effective use of technology can increase efficiency enable financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs however some new technologies needed to compete effectively result in incremental operating costs and capital investments our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations many of our competitors because of their larger size and available capital have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers within the same time frame as our large competitors failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations a failure or breach of our systems or those of our third party vendors and other service providers including as a result of cyber attacks could disrupt our businesses result in the misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses as a large financial institution we depend on our ability to process record and monitor a large number of customer transactions and customer public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased over time accordingly our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures disruptions and breakdowns our business financial accounting data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities including mobile banking and other recently developed technologies may stop operating properly or become disabled or compromised as a result of a number of factors that may be wholly or partially beyond our control for example there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters pandemics events arising from political or social matters including terrorist acts and cyber attacks although we have business continuity plans and believe we have robust information security procedures and controls in place disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks systems or devices on which customers personal information is stored and that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition regulatory fines penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensation costs andor additional compliance costs which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities including exchanges clearing houses financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us including breakdowns or failures of their own systems capacity constraints and cyber attacks in recent years information security risks for financial institutions have increased due in part to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists hostile foreign governments activists and other external parties there have been several instances involving financial services and consumerbased companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data there have also been highly publicized cases where hackers have requested ransompayments in exchange for not disclosing customer information although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened and as a result the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect and facilitate the recovery of our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a high priority for us as an additional layer of protection we have purchased network and privacy liability risk insurance coverage which includes digital asset loss business interruption loss network security liability privacy liability network extortion and data breach coverage though there can be no assurance that such insurance will fully cover any actual losses as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities disruptions in services provided by thirdparty vendors may result in a material adverse effect on our business we rely on thirdparty vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain daytoday operations for example we are dependent on our vendorprovided core banking processing systems to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions accordingly we are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or service level agreements because of changes in the vendors organizational structure financial condition support for existing products services and technology strategic focus or for any other reason such failure to perform could be disruptive to our operations which could have a materially adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition while we require thirdparty outsourced service providers to have business continuity and disaster recovery plans that are aligned with our overall recovery plans we cannot be assured that such plans will operate successfully or in a timely manner so as to prevent any such material adverse impact new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks a failure to successfully manage these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business from time to time we may implement new lines of business offer new products and services within existing lines of business or shift our asset mix there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services andor shifting asset mix we may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove attainable external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service furthermore any new line of business andor new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we face risks in connection with completed or potential acquisitions from time to time we may evaluate expansion through the acquisition of banks or branches or other financial businesses or assets such acquisitions involve various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things the possible loss of key employees and customers potential business disruptions potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the business potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities and potential difficulties in integrating the target business into our own acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of the companys tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented which may result in a material adverse effect on our business management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures failure to implement any necessary improvement of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our business may be adversely affected by fraud as a financial institution we are inherently exposed to operational risk in the form of theft and other fraudulent activity by employees customers and other third parties targeting the company or the companys customers or data such activity may take many forms including check fraud electronic fraud wire fraud phishing social engineering and other dishonest acts although we devote substantial resources to maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents given the increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators we may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud risks relating to accounting estimates our allowance for loan and lease losses may be insufficient our business is subject to periodic fluctuations based on national and local economic conditions these fluctuations are not predictable cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition for example declines in housing activity including declines in building permits and home prices may make it more difficult for our borrowers to sell their homes or refinance their debt sales may also slow which could strain the resources of real estate developers and builders we may suffer higher loan and lease losses as a result of these factors and the resulting impact on our borrowers a declining economy could negatively affect employment levels and impact the ability of our borrowers to service their debt bank regulatory agencies also periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan chargeoffs based on judgments different than those of management in addition if chargeoffs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses we may need depending on an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses any increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses will result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the adoption of the cecl methodology and the resulting impact to the company we may not be able to fully realize the balance of our net dta the value of our dta is partially reduced by a valuation allowance a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot that some portion of our dta will not be realized we regularly assess available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that our net dta will not be realized realization of a dta requires us to apply significant judgment and is inherently speculative because it requires estimates that cannot be made with certainty if we were to conclude that a significant portion of our remaining dta is not morelikelythannot to be realized the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and regulatory capital ratios if our goodwill were determined to be impaired it could have a negative impact on our profitability webster evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if necessary a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a continuing period of market disruption market capitalization to book value deterioration or slower growth rates may require us to record charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill if we were to conclude that a future writedown is necessary we would record the appropriate charge which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if all or a significant portion of the unrealized losses in our investment securities were determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired we would recognize a material charge to our earnings and our capital ratios would be adversely impacted when the fair value of a security declines management must assess whether that decline is otherthantemporary when management reviews whether a decline in fair value is otherthantemporary it considers numerous factors many of which involve significant judgment no assurance can be provided that the amount of the unrealized losses will not increase to the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio is determined to be otherthantemporary impairment we will recognize a charge to our earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made and our capital ratios will be adversely impacted if any such charge is deemed significant a rating agency might downgrade our credit rating or put us on a credit watch a downgrade or a significant reduction in our capital ratios might adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets or might increase our cost of capital even if we do not determine that the unrealized losses associated with the investment portfolio require an impairment charge increases in such unrealized losses adversely impact the tangible common equity ratio which may adversely impact credit rating agency and investor sentiment any such negative perception also may adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets or might increase our cost of capital
