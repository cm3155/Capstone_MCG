financial statements fair value assets at december the corporation periodically reviews its assumption for the longterm expected return on pension plans assets the pension was plans million the expected return on plan assets is determined by considering various factors including a total fund return estimate based on a weightedaverage of estimated returns for each asset class in each plan asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and market factors such as real rates of return inflation credit spreads equity risk premiums and excess return expectations as part of the review the corporations independent consulting actuaries performed an analysis of expected returns based on each plans expected asset allocation for the year using the willis towers watson us expected return estimator this analysis is reviewed by the corporation and used as a tool to develop expected rates of return together with other data this forecast reflects the actuarial firms view of expected long term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator as of january for example for large cap stocks for small cap stocks for international stocks for long corporate bonds and for long treasury bonds a range of expected investment returns is developed and this range relies both on forecasts and on broadmarket historical benchmarks for expected returns correlations and volatilities for each asset class as a consequence of the corporation recent increased its expected return on plan assets for year to and for the pension plans expected rates of return of and had been used for and and had been used for for the pension plans since the expected return assumption is on a longterm basis it is not materially impacted by the yearly fluctuations

corporations largest plan by approximately million if the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets the corporation shall recognize a liability equal to the unfunded projected benefit obligation and vice versa if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected benefit obligation the corporation recognizes an asset equal to the overfunded projected benefit obligation this asset or liability may result in a taxable or deductible temporary difference and its tax effect shall be recognized as an income tax expense or benefit which shall be allocated to various components of the financial statements including other comprehensive income the determination of the fair value of pension plan obligations involves judgment and any changes in those estimates could

link model to discount the expected projected cash flows of the plans the equivalent single weighted average discount rate ranged from to for the pension plans and for the opeb plan to determine the

management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities change pricing schedules adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities and enter into derivative contracts among other alternatives in managing interest interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts management objectives market and policy constraints expectations management utilizes various tools to assess irr including net interest income nii simulation modeling static gap analysis and economic value of equity eve the three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in simulation the evaluation of modeling is prepared for a fiveyear period which in conjunction with the eve analysis provides management a better view of longterm irr the corporations irr nii net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various nii simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve for example the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat implied forwards and parallel and nonparallel rate rates shocks management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures the asset and liability management group performs validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis in addition the model and processes used to assess irr are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the model governance and validation policy the corporation processes nii simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same magnitude parallel shifts the rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations reflect instantaneous parallel changes of and basis points during the succeeding twelvemonth period simulation analyses are based on many assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes interest rate spreads loan prepayments and deposit elasticity thus they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results further the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates additionally the corporation is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities including the basis related to using different rate indexes for the repricing of assets and liabilities as well as the effect of pricing lags which may be contractual or due to historical differences in the timing of management responses to changes in the rate environment forwardlooking nature computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future the following table presents the results of the simulations at december and december assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a oneyear time horizon these their by popular inc annual report table net interest income sensitivity one year projection dollars in thousands change in interest rate basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points december december amount change percent change amount change percent change compared to a substantially asset sensitive position as of december the primary reasons for the reduction in sensitivity are i the realization of much of the expected benefit in net interest income given the higher interest rates observed during ii a decrease in cash balances which reprice instantaneously term the deployment investments and loans and iii the market indexed nature of sector deposits which represented puerto rico public billion or of deposits as of december into longer via the corporations loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk which results from the ability of a third party to repay debt obligations prior to maturity prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of collateralized mortgage mortgagebacked obligations lower prepayments could extend the weighted average life of these portfolios could shorten or since prepayments securities and as of december nii simulations show the corporation has a neutral to slightly liability sensitive position driven by the rapid increase in shortterm interest rates throughout the year and its impact on puerto rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates as well as the deployment of cash to fund loan growth and purchase investments these results suggest that changes in net interest income are driven by changes in liability costs primarily puerto rico public sector deposits in declining rate scenarios net interest income would increase as the decline in the cost of these deposits generates a greater benefit than the changes in asset yields in rising rate scenarios populars sensitivity profile is also impacted by its large proportion of puerto rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates as short term rates have risen the cost of these deposits now increases in sync with market rates and therefore reduce the benefit banks typically have in

or the rate that it is required to pay on such deposits management does not believe that the impact should be material deposits at the corporations banking subsidiaries are federally all of insured subject to fdic limits and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings agencies rating deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less sensitive to changes in market rates refer to table for a breakdown of deposits by major types core deposits are generated from a large base of

restrictions by the regulators that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits which may hinder the corporations ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the corporation as of december total public sector deposits were billion compared to billion at december generally these deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral therefore liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return this now unpledged collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash however there are some timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the bank receives its collateral additionally the corporation mainly utilizes fixed rate us treasury debt securities as collateral while these securities have limited credit risk they are subject to market value risk based on changes in the interest rate environment when interest rates increase this collateral decreases and could result in the corporation having to provide to cover the same amount of deposit additional collateral liabilities this additional collateral could reduce unpledged securities otherwise available as to the corporation liquidity sources the value of for the years ended december subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the corporations financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate the corporations financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates the banking subsidiaries also are required to to meet margin deposit requirements other and collateralized borrowing facilities to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes the corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements thereby adversely affecting its liquidity finally if management is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth revenues may not increase

the total credit available on a continuing basis some of these lines could be subject to collateral requirements standards of creditworthiness regulatory requirements among other factors derivatives such as those embedded in longterm repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps and offbalance sheet exposures such as recourse performance bonds or credit card arrangements are subject to the collateral collateral requirements may increase thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities requirements as their fair value increases ratios other and for the importance of the puerto rico market the corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities in the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in puerto rico the credit quality of the corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs refer to the geographic and government risk section of this mda for some highlights on the current status of the puerto rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis for that are usually adopted contingency plans factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding in order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario management has raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of temporarily fully funds are unavailable these plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the fhlb and the frb the corporation is subject to positive tangible capital requirements to utilize secured loan facilities with the fhlb that could result in a limitation of borrowing amounts or maturity terms even if the corporation exceeds wellcapitalized regulatory capital levels available the credit ratings of populars debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the corporations ability to borrow in the capital markets its cost and access to funding sources credit ratings are based on the financial strength credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio the level popular inc annual report and volatility of earnings capital adequacy the quality of management geographic concentration in puerto rico the liquidity of the balance sheet the availability of a significant base of and the corporations ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources among other factors and commercial deposits retail core furthermore various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval a member bank must obtain the approval of the federal reserve board for any dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years after considering those years dividend activity less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock during the year ended december bppr declared cash dividends of million a portion of which was used by popular for the payments of the cash dividends on its outstanding common stock and million in accelerated stock repurchases at december bppr needed to obtain prior approval of the federal reserve board before declaring a dividend in excess of million due to its declared dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over the three years ended december in addition a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its report of condition and income unless the member bank has received the approval of the federal reserve board a member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the federal reserve board pursuant to these requirements pb may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the nysdfs the ability of a bank subsidiary to upstream dividends to its bhc could thus be impacted by its financial performance and thus capital potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the bhcs from the banking subsidiaries this could in turn affect the bhcs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock repurchase its securities or meet its debt obligations for example and regulatory including tangible capital the corporations banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the corporations overall credit ratings obligations subject to rating triggers or collateral requirements the corporations banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings the banking subsidiaries had million in deposits at december that are subject to rating triggers popular inc annual report in addition certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that bppr has with third parties include rating covenants in the event of a credit rating downgrade the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits andor increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations also as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements the corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions certain contractual agreements require the corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institutions required credit ratings are not maintained collateral pledged by the corporation to secure amounted to approximately million at december the corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed the requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the corporations liquidity resources and impact its operating results recourse obligations credit risk geographic and government risk the corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk the corporations composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements and revenue assets commonwealth of puerto rico a significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the commonwealth of puerto rico puerto rico which has faced severe economic and fiscal challenges in the past and may face additional challenges in the future caused significant damage economic performance puerto ricos economy suffered a severe and prolonged recession from to with real gross national product gnp contracting approximately during this period in and hurricane maría destruction across the island resulting in further economic contraction puerto ricos economy has been gradually recovering since in part aided by the large amount of federal disaster relief and recovery assistance funds injected into the puerto rico economy in connection with hurricane maría and other recent natural disasters this growth was interrupted by the economic shock caused by the covid19 pandemic in but has since resumed in part aided by additional federal assistance from pandemicrelated stimulus measures the latest puerto rico economic activity index published by the economic development bank for puerto rico the economic activity index reflected a increase in december compared to december during calendar year the economic activity index increased by compared to the same period in calendar year the economic activity index is a coincident indicator of ongoing economic activity but not a direct measurement of real gnp according to the puerto rico planning boards latest economic forecast dated august puerto ricos real gnp is projected to increase during the current fiscal year july 2022june while the puerto rico economy has not directly tracked the united states economy in recent years many of the external factors that impact the puerto rico economy are affected by the policies and performance of the united states economy these external factors include the level of interest rates and the rate of inflation inflation in the united states as measured by the united states consumer price index published by the us bureau of labor statistics increased in calendar year mainly driven by pentup demand and supplychain disruptions caused by the pandemic during the same period inflation in puerto rico as measured by the puerto rico consumer price index published by the department of labor and human resources of puerto rico increased for similar reasons the rate of inflation has slowed down in recent months following a mid2022 peak as the federal reserve has implemented a series of benchmark interest rate increases the speed and scope of the inflation slowdown will inform if and how much interest rates will continue to increase as well how these changes will impact the united states and puerto rico economies fiscal challenges the governments as the puerto rico economy contracted in part from borrowing to cover public debt rose rapidly to pay debt service pension benefits and other deficits government puerto rico by government had over billion in combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities had lost access to the capital markets and was in the midst of a fiscal crisis expenditures the corporations puerto ricos escalating fiscal and economic challenges and imminent widespread defaults in its public debt prompted the us congress to enact the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act promesa in june promesa created the oversight board with ample powers over puerto ricos fiscal and economic affairs and those of its and municipalities public instrumentalities collectively to pursuant pr government entities promesa the oversight board will be in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets are produced for at least four consecutive years promesa also established two mechanisms for the restructuring of the obligations of pr government entities a title iii which provides an incourt process that incorporates many of the powers and provisions of the us bankruptcy code and permits adjustment of a broad range of obligations and b title vi which provides for a largely outofcourt process through which modifications to financial debt can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors and bind holdouts since puerto rico and several of its instrumentalities have availed themselves of the debt restructuring mechanisms of titles iii and vi of promesa the puerto rico government emerged from title iii of promesa in march several instrumentalities including government development bank for puerto rico the puerto rico sales tax financing corporation and the puerto rico highways and transportation authority have also completed debt restructurings under titles iii or vi of promesa while the majority of the debt has already been restructured some pr government entities still face significant fiscal challenges for example the puerto rico electric power authority is still in the process of restructuring its debts under title iii of promesa and other pr government entities such as the puerto rico industrial development company have defaulted on their bonds but have not commenced debt restructuring proceedings under promesa municipalities fiscal and economic challenges have also puerto ricos adversely impacted its municipalities budgetary subsidies to municipalities have gradually declined in recent years and are scheduled to be ultimately eliminated by fiscal year as part the fiscal measures required by the oversight board of according to the latest puerto rico fiscal plan certified by the oversight board municipalities have made little to no progress towards implementing the fiscal discipline required to reduce reliance on these budgetary appropriations and this lack of certain fiscal management may threaten the municipalities to provide necessary services such as health sanitation public safety and emergency services to their residents expenditures municipalities are subject to promesa and at the oversight boards request are required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the oversight board for its review and approval they are also required to seek oversight board approval to issue guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of million or more with the oversight boards approval municipalities are also eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by promesa to date however no municipality has been subject to any such debt restructuring process them to ability of prioritize forcing exposure of the corporation the credit quality of bpprs loan portfolio reflects among other things the general economic conditions in puerto rico and other adverse conditions affecting puerto rico consumers and businesses deterioration in the puerto rico economy has resulted in the past and could result in the future in higher delinquencies greater chargeoffs and increased losses which popular inc annual report could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations the to us of resulting in losses at december the corporations direct exposure to pr government entities totaled million of which million were outstanding compared to million at december of which million were outstanding a deterioration in puerto ricos fiscal and economic situation could adversely affect the value of our puerto rico government obligations amount outstanding million consists of loans

cases these were general obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith credit and unlimited taxing power or special obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged basic property tax or sales tax revenues at december of the corporations exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of san juan guaynabo carolina and bayamón for additional discussion of the corporations direct exposure to the puerto rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities refer to note

the event of a borrower default and upon the conditions the corporation also had at december million in bonds issued by hfa which are secured by second mortgage loans on puerto rico residential properties and for which hfa also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions december million in the event that insured by hfa and held by the the mortgage loans corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the hfa bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans hfas ability to honor its insurance will depend among other factors on the financial condition of hfa at the time such obligations become due and payable the corporation does not consider the government guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated with this portfolio popular inc annual report bpprs commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers lessors suppliers or have other relationships with the government these borrowers could be negatively affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and economic situation of pr government entities similarly bpprs mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees and retirees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs or reductions in pension benefits if the fiscal and economic situation deteriorates rico puerto from the government as of december bppr had billion in deposits its instrumentalities and municipalities the rate at which public deposit balances may decline is uncertain and difficult to predict the amount and timing of any such reduction is likely to be impacted by for example the speed at which federal assistance is distributed and the financial condition liquidity and cash management practices of such entities as well as on the ability of bppr to maintain these customer relationships the corporation may also have direct exposure with regards to avoidance and other causes of action initiated by the oversight board on behalf of the commonwealth or other title such iii

of the debts of the usvi and its public corporations and instrumentalities to the extent that the fiscal condition of the usvi continues to deteriorate the us congress or the government of the usvi

considers current conditions macroeconomic economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable period historical loss experience portfolio composition by loan type and risk characteristics results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans and regulatory requirements amongst other factors evaluates lifetime the corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding

statistical models used to calculate in financial accounting standards and underwriting standards loan impairment measurements among others changes in the financial condition of in economic conditions

liquidity capital and results of operations could also be affected individual borrowers expected losses changes at december losses amounted to million an increase of million when the allowance for credit compared with december given that any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain the corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate its acl the baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability followed by the pessimistic scenario the corporation evaluates at least on an annual basis the assumptions tied to the cecl accounting framework these include the reasonable and supportable period as well as the reversion window during the third quarter of as part of its evaluation procedures the corporation decided to extend the reversion window from year to years the extension in the reversion window results in a better representation of historical movements for key macroeconomic variables that impact the acl this change in assumptions contributed to a reduction of million in the acl the reasonable and supportable period assumptions remained unchanged at 2years the baseline scenario assumes a annualized gdp growth for puerto rico and the united states of and for annualized expected growth was and for puerto rico and united states respectively the reduction in is due to the expected slowdown in the economy as a result of job growth and
