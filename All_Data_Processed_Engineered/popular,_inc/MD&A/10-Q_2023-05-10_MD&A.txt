deposits amounted to billion the rate at which public deposit balances may change is uncertain and difficult to predict the receipt by the puerto rico government of additional hurricane recovery related federal assistance and seasonal tax collections could increase public deposit balances at bppr in the near term the amount and timing of any reduction is likely to be impacted by for example

levels of the corporation are constantly exposed to market interest rate and liquidity risks market risk refers to the risk of a reduction in the corporations capital due to changes in the market valuation of its assets andor liabilities most of the assets subject to market valuation risk are debt securities classified as availableforsale refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the debt securities availableforsale and heldtomaturity portfolios debt securities classified as availableforsale amounted to billion as of march other assets subject to market risk include loans heldforsale which amounted to million mortgage servicing rights msrs which amounted to million and securities classified as trading which amounted to million as of march interest rate risk irr the corporations net interest income is subject to various categories of interest rate risk including repricing basis yield curve and option risks in managing interest rate risk management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities change pricing schedules adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities and enter into derivative contracts among other alternatives interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts management objectives market expectations and policy constraints management utilizes various tools to assess irr including net interest income nii simulation modeling static gap analysis and economic value of equity eve the three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of the corporations irr nii simulation modeling is prepared for a fiveyear period which in conjunction with the eve analysis provides management a better view of longterm irr net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various nii simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve for example the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates implied forwards and parallel and nonparallel rate shocks management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures the asset and liability management group performs validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis in addition the model and processes used to assess irr are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the model governance and validation policy the corporation processes nii simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same magnitude parallel shifts the rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations reflect instantaneous parallel changes of and basis points during the succeeding twelvemonth period simulation analyses are based on many assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes interest rate spreads loan prepayments and deposit elasticity thus they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results further the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates additionally the corporation is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities including the basis related to using different rate indexes for the repricing of assets and liabilities as well as the effect of pricing lags which may be contractual or due to historical differences in the timing of management responses to changes in the rate environment by their nature these forwardlooking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future the

reasons for the variation in sensitivity are changes in balance sheet composition that include a decrease in puerto rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates combined with an increase in time deposits as well as loan growth and maturities of investments these results suggest that changes in net interest income are driven primarily by changes in liability costs primarily puerto rico public sector deposits that represented billion or of deposits as of march and partly by portfolio management strategies in declining rate scenarios net interest income would increase as the decline in the cost of these deposits generates a greater benefit than the changes in asset yields in rising rate scenarios populars sensitivity profile is also impacted by its large proportion of puerto rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates as shortterm rates have risen the cost of these deposits now increases in sync with market rates and therefore reduce the benefit banks typically have in rising rate environments the corporations loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk which results from the ability of a thirdparty to repay debt obligations prior to maturity prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of mortgagebacked securities and collateralized mortgage obligations since prepayments could shorten or lower prepayments could extend the weighted average life of these portfolios trading the corporation engages in trading activities in the ordinary course of business at its subsidiaries bppr and popular securities popular securities trading activities consist primarily of marketmaking activities to meet expected customers needs related to its retail brokerage business and purchases and sales of us government and government sponsored securities with the objective of realizing gains from expected shortterm price movements bpprs trading activities consist primarily of holding us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities classified as trading and hedging the related market risk with tba tobeannounced market transactions the objective is to derive spread income from the portfolio and not to benefit from shortterm market movements in addition bppr uses forward contracts or tbas to hedge its securitization pipeline risks related to variations in interest rates and market volatility are hedged with tbas that have characteristics similar to that of the forecasted security and its conversion timeline at march the corporation held trading securities with a fair value of million representing approximately of the corporations total assets compared with million and respectively at december as shown in table the trading portfolio consists principally of mortgagebacked securities

derivatives total not on a taxable equivalent basis the corporations trading activities are limited by internal policies for each of the two subsidiaries the market risk assumed under trading activities is measured by the 5day net valueatrisk var with a confidence level of the var measures the maximum estimated loss that may occur over a 5day holding period given a probability the corporations trading portfolio had a 5day var of approximately million for the last week in march there are numerous assumptions and estimates associated with var modeling and actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates backtesting is performed to compare actual results against maximum estimated losses in order to evaluate model and assumptions accuracy in the opinion of management the size and composition of the trading portfolio does not represent a significant source of market risk for the corporation liquidity the objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that the corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations finance expected future growth fund planned capital distributions and maintain a reasonable safety margin for cash needs under both normal and stressed market conditions the board of directors is responsible for establishing the corporations tolerance for liquidity risk including approving relevant risk limits and policies the board of directors has delegated the monitoring of these risks to the boards risk management committee and the assetliability management committee the management of liquidity risk on a longterm and daytoday basis is the responsibility of the corporate treasury division the corporations corporate treasurer is responsible for implementing the policies and procedures approved by the board of directors and for monitoring the corporations liquidity position on an ongoing basis also the corporate treasury division coordinates corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities with the reportable segments oversees policy breaches and manages the escalation process the financial and operational risk management division is responsible for the independent monitoring and reporting of adherence with established policies an institutions liquidity may be pressured if for example it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow due deposit outflows whether due to a loss of confidence by depositors or other reasons exogenous events such as the covid19 pandemic a downgrading of its credit rating or some other event that causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook adverse ratings of its principal markets perceptions of the financial services industry and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding the corporation has adopted policies and limits to monitor the corporations liquidity position and that of its banking subsidiaries additionally contingency funding plans are used to model various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting different time horizons that assist management in evaluating the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events occur however such models may not predict accurately how the market and customers might react to every event and are dependent on many assumptions deposits including customer deposits brokered deposits and public funds deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for the corporation funding of the corporations total assets at march and at december the ratio of total ending loans to deposits was at march compared to at december in addition to traditional deposits the corporation maintains borrowing arrangements which amounted to approximately billion in outstanding balances at march december billion a detailed description of the corporations borrowings including their terms is included in note to the consolidated

for the corporations banking subsidiaries bppr and pb or collectively the banking subsidiaries include retail commercial and public sector deposits brokered deposits unpledged investment securities mortgage loan securitization and to a lesser extent loan sales in addition the corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the fhlb and at the discount window of the federal reserve bank of new york the frb and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged that can be used to raise funds under these facilities during the first quarter of the corporation had no material incremental use of its available liquidity sources at march the corporations available liquidity increased to billion from billion on december the liquidity sources of the corporation at march are presented in table

additional information of the corporations borrowing facilities available through its banking subsidiaries the principal uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include loan originations investment portfolio purchases loan purchases and repurchases repayment of outstanding obligations including deposits advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational expenses also the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with contractual commitments recourse provisions servicing advances derivatives and credit card licensing agreements the banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows the corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all shortterm borrowings and a portion of deposits the corporations ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits excluding brokered deposits depends on various factors including pricing service convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results and financial condition credit ratings by nationally recognized credit rating agencies customer confidence and importantly fdic deposit insurance coverage deposits at all of the corporations banking subsidiaries are federally insured subject to fdic limits and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of the aforementioned risks deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less sensitive to changes in market rates refer to table for a breakdown of deposits by major types core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and public sector customers core deposits include certificate of deposit under all non interest bearing deposits and savings deposits core deposits exclude brokered deposits core deposits have historically provided the corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and lowcost funds core deposits totaled billion or of total deposits at march compared with billion or of total deposits at december core deposits financed of the corporations earning assets at march compared with at december the distribution by maturity of certificates of deposits with denominations of and over at march is presented in the table that follows table distribution by maturity of certificate of deposits of and over in thousands months or less over to months over year to years over years total the corporation had billion in brokered deposits at march which financed approximately of its total assets december billion and respectively in the event that any of the corporations banking subsidiaries regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a wellcapitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits which may hinder the corporations ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the corporation as of march total public sector deposits were billion compared to billion at december generally these deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral therefore liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return this now unpledged collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash however there are some timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the bank receives its collateral additionally the corporation mainly utilizes fixedrate us treasury debt securities as collateral while these securities have limited credit risk they are subject to market value risk based on changes in the interest rate environment when interest rates increase the value of this collateral decreases and could result in the corporation having to provide additional collateral to cover the same amount of deposit liabilities this additional collateral could reduce unpledged securities otherwise available as liquidity sources to the corporation at march management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations as well as special needs and offbalance sheet commitments in the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity resources to address a stress event although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the corporations financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate the corporations financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates the banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements on repurchase agreements and other collateralized borrowing facilities to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes the corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements thereby adversely affecting its liquidity finally if management is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs in this case profitability would be adversely affected the corporation monitors uninsured deposits under applicable fdic regulations additionally the corporation monitors accounts with balances over while the corporation has a diverse deposit base from retail commercial corporate and government clients as well as wholesale funding sources such as brokered deposits it considers balance in excess of to have a higher potential liquidity risk table reflects the aggregate

million from the unsecured senior debt through maturity in september additionally the corporations latest quarterly dividend was per share or approximately million per quarter the bhcs have in the past borrowed in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their nonbanking subsidiaries and refinance debt obligations these sources of funding are more costly due to the fact that two out of the three principal credit rating agencies rate the corporation below investment grade which affects the corporations cost and ability to raise funds in the capital markets factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook interest rate volatility inflation disruptions in the debt market among others could also affect its ability to obtain funding the corporation has an automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the securities and exchange commission which permits the corporation to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities nonbanking subsidiaries the principal sources of funding for the nonbanking subsidiaries include internally generated cash flows from operations loan sales repurchase agreements capital injections and borrowed funds from their direct parent companies or the holding companies the principal uses of funds for the nonbanking subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt operational expenses and

available borrowing capacity under lines of credit are not necessarily a measure of the total credit available on a continuing basis some of these lines could be subject to collateral requirements changes to the value of the collateral standards of creditworthiness leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements among other factors derivatives such as those embedded in longterm repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps and offbalance sheet exposures such as recourse performance bonds or credit card arrangements are subject to collateral requirements as their fair value increases the collateral requirements may increase thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities the importance of the puerto rico market for the corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities in the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in puerto rico the credit quality of the corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs refer to the geographic and government risk section of this mda for some highlights on the current status of the puerto rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding in order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario management has adopted contingency plans for raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of funds that are usually fully available are temporarily unavailable these plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the fhlb and the frb the corporation is subject to positive tangible capital requirements to utilize secured loan facilities with the fhlb that could result in a limitation of borrowing amounts or maturity terms even if the corporation exceeds wellcapitalized regulatory capital levels the credit ratings of populars debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the corporations ability to borrow in the capital markets its cost and access to funding sources credit ratings are based on the financial strength credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio the level and volatility of earnings capital adequacy the quality of management geographic concentration in puerto rico the liquidity of the balance sheet the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits and the corporations ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources among other factors furthermore various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval a member bank must obtain the approval of the federal reserve board for any dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years after considering those years dividend activity less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock during the quarter ended march bppr declared cash dividends of million at march bppr can declare a dividend of approximately million without prior approval of the federal reserve board due to its retained income declared dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over the measurement period in addition a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its report of condition and income unless the member bank has received the approval of the federal reserve board a member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the federal reserve board pursuant to these requirements pb may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the nysdfs the ability of a bank subsidiary to upstream dividends to its bhc could thus be impacted by its financial performance and capital including tangible and regulatory capital thus potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the bhcs from the banking subsidiaries this could in turn affect the bhcs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock repurchase its securities or meet its debt obligations for example the corporations banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the corporations overall credit ratings obligations subject to rating triggers or collateral requirements the corporations banking subsidiaries currently do not issue unsecured senior debt as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings the banking subsidiaries had million in deposits at march that are subject to rating triggers in addition certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that bppr has with third parties include rating covenants in the event of a credit rating downgrade the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits andor increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations also as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements the corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions certain contractual agreements require the corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institutions required credit ratings are not maintained collateral pledged by the corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately million at march the corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed the requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the corporations liquidity resources and impact its operating results credit risk geographic and government risk the corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk the corporations assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements commonwealth of puerto rico a significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the commonwealth of puerto rico puerto rico which has faced severe economic and fiscal challenges in the past and may face additional challenges in the future economic performance puerto ricos economy suffered a severe and prolonged recession from to with real gross national product gnp contracting approximately during this period in hurricane maría caused significant damage and destruction across the island resulting in further economic contraction puerto ricos economy has been gradually recovering since in part aided by the large amount of federal disaster relief and recovery assistance funds injected into the puerto rico economy in connection with hurricane maría and other recent natural disasters this growth was interrupted by the economic shock caused by the covid19 pandemic in but has since resumed in part aided by additional federal assistance from pandemicrelated stimulus measures the latest puerto rico economic activity index published by the economic development bank for puerto rico the economic activity index reflected a and decrease in january and february respectively compared to the same months in during january and february the economic activity index increased by and respectively in a monthover month basis the economic activity index is a coincident indicator of ongoing economic activity but not a direct measurement of real gnp in february the puerto rico planning board revised its real gnp forecast for the current fiscal year july 2022june from growth to growth citing an anticipated deacceleration in the global economy while the puerto rico economy has not directly tracked the united states economy in recent years many of the external factors that impact the puerto rico economy are affected by the policies and performance of the united states economy these external factors include the level of interest rates and the rate of inflation inflation in the united states as measured by the united states consumer price index published by the us bureau of labor statistics increased during the 12month period ended march mainly driven by pentup demand and supplychain disruptions caused by the pandemic during the same period inflation in puerto rico as measured by the puerto rico consumer price index published by the department of labor and human resources of puerto rico increased for similar reasons the rate of inflation has slowed down in recent months following a mid2022 peak as the federal reserve has implemented a series of benchmark interest rate increases the speed and scope of the inflation slowdown will inform if and how much interest rates will continue to increase as well how these changes will impact the united states and puerto rico economies fiscal challenges as the puerto rico economy contracted the governments public debt rose rapidly in part from borrowing to cover deficits to pay debt service pension benefits and other government expenditures by the puerto rico government had over billion in combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities had lost access to the capital markets and was in the midst of a fiscal crisis puerto ricos escalating fiscal and economic challenges and imminent widespread defaults in its public debt prompted the us congress to enact the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act promesa in june promesa created the oversight board with ample powers over puerto ricos fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations instrumentalities and municipalities collectively pr government entities pursuant to promesa the oversight board will be in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets are produced for at least four consecutive years promesa also established two mechanisms for the restructuring of the obligations of pr government entities a title iii which provides an in court process that incorporates many of the powers and provisions of the us bankruptcy code and permits adjustment of a broad range of obligations and b title vi which provides for a largely outofcourt process through which modifications to financial debt can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors and bind holdouts since puerto rico and several of its instrumentalities have availed themselves of the debt restructuring mechanisms of titles iii and vi of promesa the puerto rico government emerged from title iii of promesa in march several instrumentalities including government development bank for puerto rico the puerto rico sales tax financing corporation and the puerto rico highways and transportation authority have also completed debt restructurings under titles iii or vi of promesa while the majority of the debt has already been restructured some pr government entities still face significant fiscal challenges for example the puerto rico electric power authority is still in the process of restructuring its debts under title iii of promesa and other pr government entities such as the puerto rico industrial development company have defaulted on their bonds but have not commenced debt restructuring proceedings under promesa municipalities puerto ricos fiscal and economic challenges have also adversely impacted its municipalities budgetary subsidies to municipalities have gradually declined in recent years and are scheduled to be ultimately eliminated by fiscal year as part of the fiscal measures required by the oversight board according to the latest puerto rico fiscal plan certified by the oversight board municipalities have made little to no progress towards implementing the fiscal discipline required to reduce reliance on these budgetary appropriations and this lack of fiscal management may threaten the ability of certain municipalities to provide necessary services such as health sanitation public safety and emergency services to their residents forcing them to prioritize expenditures municipalities are subject to promesa and at the oversight boards request are required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the oversight board for its review and approval they are also required to seek oversight board approval to issue guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of million or more with the oversight boards approval municipalities are also eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by promesa to date however no municipality has been subject to any such debt restructuring process exposure of the corporation the credit quality of bpprs loan portfolio reflects among other things the general economic conditions in puerto rico and other adverse conditions affecting puerto rico consumers and businesses deterioration in the puerto rico economy has resulted in the past and could result in the future in higher delinquencies greater chargeoffs and increased losses which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations at march the corporations direct exposure to pr government entities totaled million of which million were outstanding compared to million at december of which million were outstanding a deterioration in puerto ricos fiscal and economic situation could adversely affect the value of our puerto rico government obligations resulting in losses to us of the amount outstanding million consists of loans and million are securities million and million respectively at december all of the corporations direct exposure outstanding at march were obligations from various puerto rico municipalities in most cases these were general obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith credit and unlimited taxing power or special obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged basic property tax or sales tax revenues at march of the corporations exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of san juan guaynabo carolina and bayamón for additional discussion of the corporations direct exposure to the puerto rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities refer to note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in addition at march the corporation had million in loans insured or securities issued by puerto rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is nongovernmental million at december these included million in residential mortgage loans insured by the puerto rico housing finance authority hfa a pr government entity december million these mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on puerto rico residential properties and the hfa insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions the corporation also had at march million in bonds issued by hfa which are secured by second mortgage loans on puerto rico residential properties and for which hfa also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions december million in the event that the mortgage loans insured by hfa and held by the corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the hfa bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans hfas ability to honor its insurance will depend among other factors on the financial condition of hfa at the time such obligations become due and payable the corporation does not consider the government guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated with this portfolio bpprs commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers lessors suppliers or have other relationships with the government these borrowers could be negatively affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and economic situation of pr government entities similarly bpprs mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees and retirees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs or reductions in pension benefits if the fiscal and economic situation deteriorates as of march bppr had billion in deposits from the puerto rico government its instrumentalities and municipalities the rate at which public deposit balances may decline is uncertain and difficult to predict the amount and timing of any such reduction is likely to be impacted by for example the speed at which federal assistance is distributed and the financial condition liquidity and cash management practices of such entities as well as on the ability of bppr to maintain these customer relationships the corporation may also have direct exposure with regards to avoidance and other causes of action initiated by the oversight board on behalf of the commonwealth or other title iii debtors for additional information regarding such exposure refer to note to the consolidated financial statements united states virgin islands the corporation has operations in the united states virgin islands the usvi and has credit exposure to usvi government entities the usvi has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges which could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations promesa does not apply to the

heldinportfolio the corporation adopted the new cecl accounting standard effective on january the allowance for credit losses acl represents managements estimate of expected credit losses through the remaining contractual life of the different loan segments impacted by expected prepayments the acl is maintained at a sufficient level to provide for estimated credit losses on collateral dependent loans as well as loans modified to borrowers with financial difficulty including legacy troubled debt restructurings separately from the remainder of the loan portfolio the corporations management evaluates the adequacy of the acl on a quarterly basis in this evaluation management considers current conditions macroeconomic economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable period historical loss experience portfolio composition by loan type and risk characteristics results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans and regulatory requirements amongst other factors the corporation evaluates at least on an annual basis the assumptions tied to the cecl accounting framework including the reasonable and supportable period as well as the reversion window the corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic developments affecting specific customers industries or markets other factors that can affect managements estimates are recalibration of statistical models used to calculate lifetime expected losses changes in underwriting standards financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurements among others changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers in economic conditions and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may also affect the required level of the allowance for credit losses consequently the business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations could also be affected given that any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain the corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate its acl the baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability followed by the pessimistic scenario the baseline scenario assumes a annualized gdp growth in the baseline scenario stands at and for puerto rico and the united states respectively increasing from and in the previous quarter the forecasted average unemployment rate continues strong improving quarteroverquarter to and for puerto rico and the united states respectively from and respectively in the previous forecast at march the

cash flow dcf method this impact resulted in a release in the acl of approximately million presented as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings net of tax effect excluding asu impact the acl for bppr increased by million when compared to december mostly driven by reductions in the hpi forecast higher loan volumes and migration of consumer credit scores the acl for popular
