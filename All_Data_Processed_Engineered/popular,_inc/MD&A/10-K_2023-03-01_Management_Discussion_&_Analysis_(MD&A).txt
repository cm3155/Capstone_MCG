forwardlooking statements this accordingly this evaluation is composed of three major components us mainland operations puerto rico banking operations and holding company for the evaluation of the realization of the deferred tax asset by taxing jurisdiction refer to note to the consolidated financial statements under the puerto rico internal revenue code the corporation and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns the code provides a dividendsreceived deduction of on dividends received from controlled subsidiaries subject to taxation in puerto rico and on dividends received from other taxable domestic corporations changes in the corporations estimates can occur due to changes in tax rates new business strategies newly enacted guidance and resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions such changes could affect the amount of accrued taxes the corporation has made tax payments in accordance with estimated tax payments rules any remaining payment will not have any significant impact on liquidity and capital resources the valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns and future profitability the accounting for deferred tax consequences represents managements best estimate of those future events changes in managements current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on the corporations financial condition and results of operations the corporation establishes tax liabilities or reduces tax assets for uncertain tax positions when despite its assessment that the tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law the corporation believes it may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged in evaluating a tax position the corporation determines whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position the corporations estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the corporation evaluates these uncertain tax positions each quarter and adjusts the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations the corporation believes the estimates and assumptions used to support its evaluation of uncertain tax positions are reasonable the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons including adding amounts for current tax year positions expiration of open income tax returns due to the statutes of limitation changes in managements judgment about the level of uncertainty status of examinations litigation and legislative activity and the addition or elimination of uncertain tax positions although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain the corporation believes that adequate amounts of tax interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result from open years from time to time the corporation is audited by various federal state and local authorities regarding income tax matters although management believes its approach in determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in accordance with the accounting standards it is possible that the final tax authority will take a tax position that is different than the tax position reflected in the corporations income tax provision and other tax reserves as each audit is conducted adjustments if any are appropriately recorded in the consolidated financial statement in the period determined such differences could have an adverse effect on the corporations income tax provision or benefit or other tax reserves in the reporting period in which such determination is made and consequently on the corporations results of operations financial position and or cash flows for such period goodwill and other intangible assets the corporations goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment intangibles with indefinite lives are evaluated for impairment at least annually and on a more frequent basis if events or circumstances indicate impairment could have taken place such events could include among others a significant adverse change in the business climate an adverse action by a regulator an unanticipated change in the competitive environment and a decision to change the operations or dispose of a reporting unit other identifiable intangible assets with a finite useful life are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable goodwill impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of any of the reporting units exceeds its fair value up to the amount of the goodwill the corporation estimates the fair value of each reporting unit consistent with the requirements of the fair value measurements accounting standard generally using a combination of methods including market price multiples of comparable companies and transactions as well as discounted cash flow analyses subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted under applicable accounting standards for a detailed description of the annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed by the corporation during the third quarter of refer to note to the consolidated financial statements pension and postretirement benefit obligations the corporation provides pension and restoration benefit plans for certain employees of various subsidiaries the corporation also provides certain health care benefits for retired employees of bppr the noncontributory defined pension and benefit restoration plans the pension plans are frozen with regards to all future benefit accruals the estimated benefit costs and obligations of the pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plan opeb plan are impacted by the use of subjective assumptions which can materially affect recorded amounts including expected returns on plan assets discount rates termination rates retirement rates and health care trend rates management applies judgment in the determination of these factors which normally undergo evaluation against current industry practice and the actual experience of the corporation the corporation uses an independent actuarial firm for assistance in the determination of the pension plans and opeb plan costs and obligations detailed information on the plans and related valuation assumptions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements the corporation periodically reviews its assumption for the longterm expected return on pension plans assets the pension plans assets fair value at december was million the expected return on plan assets is determined by considering various factors including a total fund return estimate based on a weightedaverage of estimated returns for each asset class in each plan asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and market factors such as real rates of return inflation credit spreads equity risk premiums and excess return expectations as part of the review the corporations independent consulting actuaries performed an analysis of expected returns based on each plans expected asset allocation for the year using the willis towers watson us expected return estimator this analysis is reviewed by the corporation and used as a tool to develop expected rates of return together with other data this forecast reflects the actuarial firms view of expected longterm rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator as of january for example for large cap stocks for small cap stocks for international stocks for long corporate bonds and for long treasury bonds a range of expected investment returns is developed and this range relies both on forecasts and on broadmarket historical benchmarks for expected returns correlations and volatilities for each asset class as a consequence of recent reviews the corporation increased its expected return on plan assets for year to and for the pension plans expected rates of return of and had been used for and and had been used for for the pension plans since the expected return assumption is on a longterm basis it is not materially impacted by the yearly fluctuations either positive or negative in the actual return on assets the expected return can be materially impacted by a change in the plans asset allocation net periodic benefit cost pension expense for the pension plans amounted to a net benefit of million in the total pension expense included a benefit of million for the expected return on assets pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets for example decreasing the expected rate of return for from to would increase the projected pension expense for the banco popular de puerto rico retirement plan the corporations largest plan by approximately million if the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets the corporation shall recognize a liability equal to the unfunded projected benefit obligation and vice versa if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the projected benefit obligation the corporation recognizes an asset equal to the overfunded projected benefit obligation this asset or liability may result in a taxable or deductible temporary difference and its tax effect shall be recognized as an income tax expense or benefit which shall be allocated to various components of the financial statements including other comprehensive income the determination of the fair value of pension plan obligations involves judgment and any changes in those estimates could impact the corporations consolidated statements of financial condition management believes that the fair value estimates of the pension plans assets are reasonable given the valuation methodologies used to measure the investments at fair value as described in note to the consolidated financial statements also the compositions of the plan assets are primarily in equity and debt securities which have readily determinable quoted market prices the corporation had recorded a pension liability of million at december the corporation uses the spot rate yield curve from the willis towers watson rate link model to discount the expected projected cash flows of the plans the equivalent single weighted average discount rate ranged from to for the pension plans and for the opeb plan to determine the benefit obligations at december a basis point decrease to each of the rates in the december willis towers watson rate link model would increase the projected expense for the banco popular de puerto rico retirement plan by approximately million the change would not affect the minimum required contribution to the pension plans the opeb plan was unfunded no assets were held

conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall popular bppr and pb are required to maintain this additional capital conservation

economic growth and regulatory paperwork reduction act of that simplified several requirements in the agencies regulatory capital rules these rules simplified the regulatory capital requirement for mortgage servicing assets msas deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions by raising the cet1 deduction threshold from to the cet1 deduction threshold which applies to the aggregate amount of such items was eliminated the rule also requires among other changes increasing from to the risk weight to msas and temporary difference deferred tax asset not deducted from capital for investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions the risk weight would be based on the exposure category of the investment the decrease in the cet1 capital ratio tier capital ratio and total capital ratio as of december compared to december was mostly due to an increase in risk weighted assets driven by the growth in the commercial and consumer loan portfolios partially offset by the annual earnings net of the accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase an aggregate of million and million of populars common stock the increase in leverage capital ratio was mainly due to the decrease in average total assets driven by the reduction in zerorisk weighted investments in money market fed accounts and zero or lowrisk weighted debt securities that therefore did not have a significant impact on the riskweighted assets pursuant to the adoption of cecl on january the corporation elected to use the fiveyear transition period option as provided in the final interim regulatory capital rules effective march the fiveyear transition period provision delays for two years the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of the capital benefits provided during the initial twoyear delay as of december the corporation had phasedin of the cumulative cecl deferral with the remaining impact to be recognized over the remaining two years in the first quarter of the corporation will phase in a cumulative of the deferral on august federal banking regulators issued a final rule to modify the basel iii regulatory capital rules applicable to banking organizations to allow those organizations participating in the paycheck protection program ppp established under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act to neutralize the regulatory capital effects of participating in the program specifically the agencies have clarified that banking organizations including the corporation and its bank subsidiaries are permitted to assign a zero percent risk weight to ppp loans for purposes of determining riskweighted assets and riskbased capital ratios additionally in order to facilitate use of the paycheck protection program liquidity facility the pppl facility which provides federal reserve bank loans to eligible financial institutions such as the corporations bank subsidiaries to fund ppp loans the agencies further clarified that for purposes of determining leverage ratios a

common share which are presented in the table that follows are nongaap measures management and many stock analysts use the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare the capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method of accounting for mergers and acquisitions neither tangible common equity nor tangible assets or related measures should be considered in isolation or as a

which the corporation calculates its tangible common equity tangible assets and any other related measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names the decrease in the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio during was mainly related to the decrease in the fair value of the corporations fixed rate available for sale debt securities portfolio and its impact on the unrealized loss component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci given its ability due to the corporations liquidity position and its intention to reduce the impact on aoci and tangible capital of further increases in interest rates management changed its intent to hold certain securities to maturity therefore in october the corporation transferred us treasury securities

assets andor liabilities most of the assets subject to market valuation risk are debt securities classified as availableforsale refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the debt securities availableforsale and heldtomaturity portfolios debt securities classified as availableforsale amounted to billion as of december other assets subject to market risk include loans heldforsale which amounted to million mortgage servicing rights msrs which amounted to million and securities classified as trading which amounted to million as of december interest rate risk irr the corporations net interest income is subject to various categories of interest rate risk including repricing basis yield curve and option risks in managing interest rate risk management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities change pricing schedules adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities and enter into derivative contracts among other alternatives interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts management objectives market expectations and policy constraints management utilizes various tools to assess irr including net interest income nii simulation modeling static gap analysis and economic value of equity eve the three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of the corporations irr nii simulation modeling is prepared for a fiveyear period which in conjunction with the eve analysis provides management a better view of longterm irr net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various nii simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve for example the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates implied forwards and parallel and nonparallel rate shocks management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures the asset and liability management group performs validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis in addition the model and processes used to assess irr are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the model governance and validation policy the corporation processes nii simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same magnitude parallel shifts the rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations reflect instantaneous parallel changes of and basis points during the succeeding twelvemonth period simulation analyses are based on many assumptions including relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes interest rate spreads loan prepayments and deposit elasticity thus they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results further the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates additionally the corporation is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities including the basis related to using different rate indexes for the repricing of assets and liabilities as well as the effect of pricing lags which may be contractual or due to historical differences in the timing of management responses to changes in the rate environment by their nature these forwardlooking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future the following table presents the results of the simulations at december and december assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a oneyear time horizon table net interest income sensitivity one year projection dollars in thousands change in interest rate basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points december december amount change percent change amount change percent change as of december nii simulations show the corporation has a neutral to slightly liability sensitive position driven by the rapid increase in shortterm interest rates throughout the year and its impact on puerto rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates as well as the deployment of cash to fund loan growth and purchase investments these results suggest that changes in net interest income are driven by changes in liability costs primarily puerto rico public sector deposits in declining rate scenarios net interest income would increase as the decline in the cost of these deposits generates a greater benefit than the changes in asset yields in rising rate scenarios populars sensitivity profile is also impacted by its large proportion of puerto rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates as shortterm rates have risen the cost of these deposits now increases in sync with market rates and therefore reduce the benefit banks typically have in rising rate environments as of december popular has a more neutral position as compared to a substantially asset sensitive position as of december the primary reasons for the reduction in sensitivity are i the realization of much of the expected benefit in net interest income given the higher interest rates observed during ii a decrease in cash balances which reprice instantaneously via the deployment into longer term investments and loans and iii the market indexed nature of puerto rico public sector deposits which represented billion or of deposits as of december the corporations loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk which results from the ability of a thirdparty to repay debt obligations prior to maturity prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of mortgagebacked securities and collateralized mortgage obligations since prepayments could shorten or lower prepayments could extend the weighted average life of these portfolios table

with var modeling and actual results could differ from these assumptions and estimates backtesting is performed to compare actual results against maximum estimated losses in order to evaluate model and assumptions accuracy in the opinion of management the size and composition of the trading portfolio does not represent a significant source of market risk for the corporation derivatives derivatives may be used by the corporation as part of its overall interest rate risk management strategy to minimize significant unexpected fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that are caused by interest rate volatility derivative instruments that the corporation may use include among others interest rate caps indexed options and forward contracts the corporation does not use highly leveraged derivative instruments in its interest rate risk management strategy credit risk embedded in these transactions is reduced by requiring appropriate collateral from counterparties and entering into netting agreements whenever possible all outstanding derivatives are recognized in the corporations consolidated statements of condition at their fair value refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the corporations involvement in derivative instruments and hedging activities cash flow hedges the corporation manages the variability of cash payments due to interest rate fluctuations by the effective use of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and that are linked to specified hedged assets and liabilities the cash flow hedges relate to forward contracts or tba mortgagebacked securities that are sold and bought for future settlement to hedge mortgagebacked securities and loans prior to securitization the seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date a specified instrument at a specified price or yield these securities are hedging a forecasted transaction and are designated for cash flow hedge accounting the notional amount of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges at december amounted to million million refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative information on these derivative contracts fair value hedges the corporation did not have any derivatives designated as fair value hedges during the years ended december and trading and nonhedging derivative activities the corporation enters into derivative positions based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and markets mostly to economically hedge a related asset or liability the corporation also enters into various derivatives to provide these types of derivative products to customers these freestanding derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as part of the results of operations for the period following is a description of the most significant of the corporations derivative activities that are not designated for hedge accounting the corporation has overthecounter option contracts which are utilized in order to limit the corporations exposure on customer deposits whose returns are tied to the sp or to certain other equity securities or commodity indexes in these certificates the customers principal is guaranteed by the corporation and insured by the fdic to the maximum extent permitted by law the instruments pay a return based on the increase of these indexes as applicable during the term of the instrument accordingly this product gives customers the opportunity to invest in a product that protects the principal invested but allows the customer the potential to earn a return based on the performance of the indexes the risk of issuing certificates of deposit with returns tied to the applicable indexes is economically hedged by the corporation indexed options are purchased from financial institutions with strong credit standings whose return is designed to match the return payable on the certificates of deposit issued by hedging the risk in this manner the effective cost of these deposits is fixed the contracts have a maturity and an index equal to the terms of the pool of retail deposits that they are economically hedging the purchased indexed options are used to economically hedge the bifurcated embedded option these option contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and therefore cannot be designated as accounting hedges at december the notional amount of the indexed options on deposits approximated million million with a fair value of million asset million while the embedded options had a notional value of million million with a fair value of million liability million refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other nonhedging derivative activities utilized by the corporation during and foreign exchange the corporation holds an interest in bhd león in the dominican republic which is an investment accounted for under the equity method the corporations carrying value of the equity interest in bhd león approximated million at december this business is conducted in the countrys foreign currency the resulting foreign currency translation adjustment from operations for which the functional currency is other than the us dollar is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of condition except for highlyinflationary environments in which the effects would be included in the consolidated statements of operations at december the corporation had approximately million in an unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustment as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss compared with an unfavorable adjustment of million at december and million at december liquidity the objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that the corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations finance expected future growth fund planned capital distributions and maintain a reasonable safety margin for cash commitments under both normal and stressed market conditions the board of directors is responsible for establishing the corporations tolerance for liquidity risk including approving relevant risk limits and policies the board of directors has delegated the monitoring of these risks to the boards risk management committee and the assetliability management committee the management of liquidity risk on a longterm and daytoday basis is the responsibility of the corporate treasury division the corporations corporate treasurer is responsible for implementing the policies and procedures approved by the board of directors and for monitoring the corporations liquidity position on an ongoing basis also the corporate treasury division coordinates corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities with the reportable segments oversees policy breaches and manages the escalation process the financial and operational risk management division is responsible for the independent monitoring and reporting of adherence with established policies an institutions liquidity may be pressured if for example it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow due to exogenous events such as the covid19 pandemic its credit rating is downgraded or some other event causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook adverse ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding liquidity is managed by the corporation at the level of the holding companies that own the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries it is also managed at the level of the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries as further explained below a principal source of liquidity for the bank holding companies the bhcs are dividends received from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries the corporation has adopted policies and limits to monitor more effectively the corporations liquidity position and that of the banking subsidiaries additionally contingency funding plans are used to model various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting different time horizons that assist management in evaluating the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events occur however such models may not predict accurately how the market and customers might react to every event and are dependent on many assumptions deposits including customer deposits brokered deposits and public funds deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for the corporation funding of the corporations total assets at december and at december the ratio of total ending loans to deposits was at december compared to at december in addition to traditional deposits the corporation maintains borrowing arrangements which amounted to approximately billion in outstanding balances at december december billion a detailed description of the corporations borrowings including their terms is included in note to the consolidated financial statements also the consolidated statements of cash flows in the accompanying consolidated financial statements provide information on the corporations cash inflows and outflows on july the corporation completed an asr program for the repurchase of an aggregate million of populars common stock for which an initial  were delivered in march the march asr agreement upon the final settlement of the march asr agreement the corporation received an additional  of common stock the corporation repurchased a total of  at an average purchase price of which were recorded as treasury stock by million under the march asr agreement on december the corporation completed the settlement of another asr agreement for the repurchase of an aggregate million of populars common stock for which an initial  were delivered on august the august asr upon the final settlement of the asr agreement the corporation received an additional  of common stock the corporation repurchased a total of  at an average purchase price of which were recorded as treasury stock by million under the august asr agreement refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the following sections provide further information on the corporations major funding activities and needs as well as the risks involved in these activities banking subsidiaries primary sources of funding for the corporations banking subsidiaries bppr and pb or collectively the banking subsidiaries include retail commercial and public sector deposits brokered deposits unpledged investment securities mortgage loan securitization and to a lesser extent loan sales in addition the corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the fhlb and at the discount window of the federal reserve bank of new york the frb and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged that can be used to raise funds under these facilities refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information of the corporations borrowing facilities available through its banking subsidiaries the principal uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include loan originations investment portfolio purchases loan purchases and repurchases repayment of outstanding obligations including deposits advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational expenses also the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with contractual commitments recourse provisions servicing advances derivatives and credit card licensing agreements the banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows the corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all shortterm borrowings and a portion of deposits the corporations ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits excluding brokered deposits depends on various factors including pricing service convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results credit ratings by nationally recognized credit rating agencies and importantly fdic deposit insurance although a downgrade in the credit ratings of the corporations banking subsidiaries may impact their ability to raise retail and commercial deposits or the rate that it is required to pay on such deposits management does not believe that the impact should be material deposits at all of the corporations banking subsidiaries are federally insured subject to fdic limits and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of a downgrade in the credit ratings deposits are a key source of funding as they tend to be less volatile than institutional borrowings and their cost is less sensitive to changes in market rates refer to table for a breakdown of deposits by major types core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and public sector customers core deposits include all noninterest bearing deposits savings deposits and certificates of deposit under excluding brokered deposits with denominations under core deposits have historically provided the corporation with a sizable source of relatively stable and lowcost funds core deposits totaled billion or of total deposits at december compared with billion or of total deposits at december core deposits financed of the corporations earning assets at december compared with at december the distribution by maturity of certificates of deposits with denominations of and over at december is presented in the table that follows table distribution by maturity of certificate of deposits of and over in thousands months or less over to months over year

table average total deposits in thousands noninterest bearing demand deposits savings accounts now money market and other interest bearing demand accounts certificates of deposit total interest bearing deposits total average deposits for the years ended december the corporation had billion in brokered deposits at december which financed approximately of its total assets december billion and respectively in the event that any of the corporations banking subsidiaries regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a wellcapitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators that banking subsidiary faces the risk of not being able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and faces limitations on the rate paid on deposits which may hinder the corporations ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the corporation as of december total public sector deposits were billion compared to billion at december generally these deposits require that the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral therefore liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return this now unpledged collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash however there are some timing differences between the time the deposit outflow occurs and when the bank receives its collateral additionally the corporation mainly utilizes fixedrate us treasury debt securities as collateral while these securities have limited credit risk they are subject to market value risk based on changes in the interest rate environment when interest rates increase the value of this collateral decreases and could result in the corporation having to provide additional collateral to cover the same amount of deposit liabilities this additional collateral could reduce unpledged securities otherwise available as liquidity sources to the corporation at december management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations as well as special needs and offbalance sheet commitments in the ordinary course of business and have sufficient liquidity resources to address a stress event although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the corporations financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate the corporations financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates the banking subsidiaries also are required to deposit cash or qualifying securities to meet margin requirements on repurchase agreements and other collateralized borrowing facilities to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines because of market changes the corporation will be required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements thereby adversely affecting its liquidity finally if management is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to meet its future growth revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs in this case profitability would be adversely affected bank holding companies the principal sources of funding for the bhcs which are popular inc holding company only and pna include cash on hand investment securities dividends received from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries asset sales credit facilities available from affiliate banking subsidiaries and proceeds from potential securities offerings dividends from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory limits and authorization requirements that are further described below and that may limit the ability of those subsidiaries to act as a source of funding to the bhcs the principal use of these funds includes the repayment of debt and interest payments to holders of senior debt and junior subordinated deferrable interest related to trust preferred securities the payment of dividends to common stockholders repurchases of the corporations securities and capitalizing its banking subsidiaries the outstanding balance of notes payable at the bhcs amounted to million at december and million at december the contractual maturities of the bhcs notes payable at december are presented in table table distribution of bhcs notes payable by contractual maturity year later years total in thousands the corporations unsecured senior debt securities mature in the september of annual debt service at the bhcs is approximately million and the corporations latest quarterly dividend was per share or approximately million per quarter as of december the bhcs had cash and money markets investments totaling million and borrowing potential of million from its secured facility with bppr the bhcs liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash on hand investments and other sources of liquidity which are expected to be enough to meet all interest payments and dividend obligations during the foreseeable future the corporation intends to refinance the unsecured senior debt prior to its maturity in september if we are unable to refinance these notes we could have to declare extraordinary dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to repay such notes our ability to declare such dividends could be subject to approval of the federal reserve board the bhcs have in the past borrowed in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their nonbanking subsidiaries and refinance debt obligations these sources of funding are more costly due to the fact that two out of the three principal credit rating agencies rate the corporation below investment grade which affects the corporations cost and ability to raise funds in the capital markets factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook interest rate volatility inflation disruptions in the debt market among others could also affect its ability to obtain funding the corporation has an automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the securities and exchange commission which permits the corporation to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities on july the corporation exchanged a portion of evertec shares as part of a transaction in which it acquired certain critical channels from evertec and renegotiated several service agreements the corporation completed the sale of its remaining shares of evertec on august following the evertec stock sale popular no longer owns any evertec common stock nonbanking subsidiaries the principal sources of funding for the nonbanking subsidiaries include internally generated cash flows from operations loan sales repurchase agreements capital injections and borrowed funds from their direct parent companies or the holding companies the principal uses of funds for the nonbanking subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt operational expenses and payment of dividends to the bhcs the liquidity needs of the nonbanking subsidiaries are minimal since most of them are funded internally from operating cash flows or from intercompany borrowings or capital contributions from their holding companies during the period ended december popular inc made capital contributions to

source of liquidity other funding sources and capital the debt securities portfolio provides an additional source of liquidity which may be realized through either securities sales or repurchase agreements the corporations debt securities portfolio consists primarily of liquid us government debt securities us government sponsored agency debt securities us government sponsored agency mortgagebacked securities and us government sponsored agency collateralized mortgage obligations that can be used to raise funds in the repo markets the availability of the repurchase agreement would be subject to having sufficient unpledged collateral available at the time the transactions are to be consummated in addition to overall liquidity and risk appetite of the various counterparties the corporations unpledged debt securities amounted to billion at december and billion at december a substantial portion of these debt securities could be used to raise financing in the us money markets or from secured lending sources additional liquidity may be provided through loan maturities prepayments and sales the loan portfolio can also be used to obtain funding in the capital markets in particular mortgage loans and some types of consumer loans have secondary markets which the corporation could use offbalance sheet arrangements and other commitments in the ordinary course of business the corporation engages in financial transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet or may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction as a provider of financial services the corporation routinely enters into commitments with offbalance sheet risk to meet the financial needs of its customers these commitments may include loan commitments and standby letters of credit these commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process used for onbalance sheet instruments these

of which million were related to dividend distributions in addition during the year ending december the obligor group recorded million in proceeds from the sale of two of its direct equity method investees risks to liquidity total lines of credit outstanding are not necessarily a measure of the total credit available on a continuing basis some of these lines could be subject to collateral requirements standards of creditworthiness leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements among other factors derivatives such as those embedded in longterm repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps and offbalance sheet exposures such as recourse performance bonds or credit card arrangements are subject to collateral requirements as their fair value increases the collateral requirements may increase thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities the importance of the puerto rico market for the corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities in the case of a deterioration in economic and fiscal conditions in puerto rico the credit quality of the corporation could be affected and result in higher credit costs refer to the geographic and government risk section of this mda for some highlights on the current status of the puerto rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook and credit ratings of its principal markets and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding in order to prepare for the possibility of such scenario management has adopted contingency plans for raising financing under stress scenarios when important sources of funds that are usually fully available are temporarily unavailable these plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the fhlb and the frb the corporation is subject to positive tangible capital requirements to utilize secured loan facilities with the fhlb that could result in a limitation of borrowing amounts or maturity terms even if the corporation exceeds wellcapitalized regulatory capital levels the credit ratings of populars debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the corporations ability to borrow in the capital markets its cost and access to funding sources credit ratings are based on the financial strength credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio the level and volatility of earnings capital adequacy the quality of management geographic concentration in puerto rico the liquidity of the balance sheet the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits and the corporations ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources among other factors furthermore various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval a member bank must obtain the approval of the federal reserve board for any dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years after considering those years dividend activity less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock during the year ended december bppr declared cash dividends of million a portion of which was used by popular for the payments of the cash dividends on its outstanding common stock and million in accelerated stock repurchases at december bppr needed to obtain prior approval of the federal reserve board before declaring a dividend in excess of million due to its declared dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over the three years ended december in addition a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its report of condition and income unless the member bank has received the approval of the federal reserve board a member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the federal reserve board pursuant to these requirements pb may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the nysdfs the ability of a bank subsidiary to upstream dividends to its bhc could thus be impacted by its financial performance and capital including tangible and regulatory capital thus potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the bhcs from the banking subsidiaries this could in turn affect the bhcs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock repurchase its securities or meet its debt obligations for example the corporations banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the corporations overall credit ratings obligations subject to rating triggers or collateral requirements the corporations banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings the banking subsidiaries had million in deposits at december that are subject to rating triggers in addition certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that bppr has with third parties include rating covenants in the event of a credit rating downgrade the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits andor increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations also as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements the corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions certain contractual agreements require the corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institutions required credit ratings are not maintained collateral pledged by the corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately million at december the corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed the requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the corporations liquidity resources and impact its operating results credit risk geographic and government risk the corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk the corporations assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements commonwealth of puerto rico a significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the commonwealth of puerto rico puerto rico which has faced severe economic and fiscal challenges in the past and may face additional challenges in the future economic performance puerto ricos economy suffered a severe and prolonged recession from to with real gross national product gnp contracting approximately during this period in hurricane maría caused significant damage and destruction across the island resulting in further economic contraction puerto ricos economy has been gradually recovering since in part aided by the large amount of federal disaster relief and recovery assistance funds injected into the puerto rico economy in connection with hurricane maría and other recent natural disasters this growth was interrupted by the economic shock caused by the covid19 pandemic in but has since resumed in part aided by additional federal assistance from pandemicrelated stimulus measures the latest puerto rico economic activity index published by the economic development bank for puerto rico the economic activity index reflected a increase in december compared to december during calendar year the economic activity index increased by compared to the same period in calendar year the economic activity index is a coincident indicator of ongoing economic activity but not a direct measurement of real gnp according to the puerto rico planning boards latest economic forecast dated august puerto ricos real gnp is projected to increase during the current fiscal year july 2022june while the puerto rico economy has not directly tracked the united states economy in recent years many of the external factors that impact the puerto rico economy are affected by the policies and performance of the united states economy these external factors include the level of interest rates and the rate of inflation inflation in the united states as measured by the united states consumer price index published by the us bureau of labor statistics increased in calendar year mainly driven by pentup demand and supplychain disruptions caused by the pandemic during the same period inflation in puerto rico as measured by the puerto rico consumer price index published by the department of labor and human resources of puerto rico increased for similar reasons the rate of inflation has slowed down in recent months following a mid2022 peak as the federal reserve has implemented a series of benchmark interest rate increases the speed and scope of the inflation slowdown will inform if and how much interest rates will continue to increase as well how these changes will impact the united states and puerto rico economies fiscal challenges as the puerto rico economy contracted the governments public debt rose rapidly in part from borrowing to cover deficits to pay debt service pension benefits and other government expenditures by the puerto rico government had over billion in combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities had lost access to the capital markets and was in the midst of a fiscal crisis puerto ricos escalating fiscal and economic challenges and imminent widespread defaults in its public debt prompted the us congress to enact the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act promesa in june promesa created the oversight board with ample powers over puerto ricos fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations instrumentalities and municipalities collectively pr government entities pursuant to promesa the oversight board will be in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets are produced for at least four consecutive years promesa also established two mechanisms for the restructuring of the obligations of pr government entities a title iii which provides an in court process that incorporates many of the powers and provisions of the us bankruptcy code and permits adjustment of a broad range of obligations and b title vi which provides for a largely outofcourt process through which modifications to financial debt can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors and bind holdouts since puerto rico and several of its instrumentalities have availed themselves of the debt restructuring mechanisms of titles iii and vi of promesa the puerto rico government emerged from title iii of promesa in march several instrumentalities including government development bank for puerto rico the puerto rico sales tax financing corporation and the puerto rico highways and transportation authority have also completed debt restructurings under titles iii or vi of promesa while the majority of the debt has already been restructured some pr government entities still face significant fiscal challenges for example the puerto rico electric power authority is still in the process of restructuring its debts under title iii of promesa and other pr government entities such as the puerto rico industrial development company have defaulted on their bonds but have not commenced debt restructuring proceedings under promesa municipalities puerto ricos fiscal and economic challenges have also adversely impacted its municipalities budgetary subsidies to municipalities have gradually declined in recent years and are scheduled to be ultimately eliminated by fiscal year as part of the fiscal measures required by the oversight board according to the latest puerto rico fiscal plan certified by the oversight board municipalities have made little to no progress towards implementing the fiscal discipline required to reduce reliance on these budgetary appropriations and this lack of fiscal management may threaten the ability of certain municipalities to provide necessary services such as health sanitation public safety and emergency services to their residents forcing them to prioritize expenditures municipalities are subject to promesa and at the oversight boards request are required to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets to the oversight board for its review and approval they are also required to seek oversight board approval to issue guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of million or more with the oversight boards approval municipalities are also eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by promesa to date however no municipality has been subject to any such debt restructuring process exposure of the corporation the credit quality of bpprs loan portfolio reflects among other things the general economic conditions in puerto rico and other adverse conditions affecting puerto rico consumers and businesses deterioration in the puerto rico economy has resulted in the past and could result in the future in higher delinquencies greater chargeoffs and increased losses which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations at december the corporations direct exposure to pr government entities totaled million of which million were outstanding compared to million at december of which million were outstanding a deterioration in puerto ricos fiscal and economic situation could adversely affect the value of our puerto rico government obligations resulting in losses to us of the amount outstanding million consists of loans and million are securities million and million respectively at december all of the corporations direct exposure outstanding at december were obligations from various puerto rico municipalities in most cases these were general obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith credit and unlimited taxing power or special obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged basic property tax or sales tax revenues at december of the corporations exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of san juan guaynabo carolina and bayamón for additional discussion of the corporations direct exposure to the puerto rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities refer to note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in addition at december the corporation had million in loans insured or securities issued by puerto rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is nongovernmental million at december these included million in residential mortgage loans insured by the puerto rico housing finance authority hfa a pr government entity december million these mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on puerto rico residential properties and the hfa insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions the corporation also had at december million in bonds issued by hfa which are secured by second mortgage loans on puerto rico residential properties and for which hfa also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions december million in the event that the mortgage loans insured by hfa and held by the corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the hfa bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans hfas ability to honor its insurance will depend among other factors on the financial condition of hfa at the time such obligations become due and payable the corporation does not consider the government guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated with this portfolio bpprs commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers lessors suppliers or have other relationships with the government these borrowers could be negatively affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and economic situation of pr government entities similarly bpprs mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees and retirees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs or reductions in pension benefits if the fiscal and economic situation deteriorates as of december bppr had billion in deposits from the puerto rico government its instrumentalities and municipalities the rate at which public deposit balances may decline is uncertain and difficult to predict the amount and timing of any such reduction is likely to be impacted by for example the speed at which federal assistance is distributed and the financial condition liquidity and cash management practices of such entities as well as on the ability of bppr to maintain these customer relationships the corporation may also have direct exposure with regards to avoidance and other causes of action initiated by the oversight board on behalf of the commonwealth or other title iii debtors for additional information regarding such exposure refer to note to the consolidated financial statements united states virgin islands the corporation has operations in the united states virgin islands the usvi and has credit exposure to usvi government entities the usvi has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges which could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations promesa does not apply to the usvi and as such there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the usvi and its public corporations and instrumentalities to the extent that the fiscal condition of the usvi continues to deteriorate the us congress or the government of the usvi may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of usvi government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies including by making promesa applicable to the usvi at december the corporation had approximately million in direct exposure to usvi government entities december million british virgin islands the corporation has operations in the british virgin islands bvi which has been negatively affected by the covid19 pandemic particularly as a reduction in the tourism activity which accounts for a significant portion of its economy although the corporation has no significant exposure to a single borrower in the bvi at december it has a loan portfolio amounting to approximately million comprised of various retail and commercial clients compared to a loan portfolio of million at december us government as further detailed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements a

financial statements for additional information of guaranteed loans allowance for credit losses acl the corporation adopted the new cecl accounting standard effective on january the allowance for credit losses acl represents managements estimate of expected credit losses through the remaining contractual life of the different loan segments impacted by expected prepayments the acl is maintained at a sufficient level to provide for estimated credit losses on collateral dependent loans as well as troubled debt restructurings separately from the remainder of the loan portfolio the corporations management evaluates the adequacy of the acl on a quarterly basis in this evaluation management considers current conditions macroeconomic economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable period historical loss experience portfolio composition by loan type and risk characteristics results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans and regulatory requirements amongst other factors the corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic developments affecting specific customers industries or markets other factors that can affect managements estimates are recalibration of statistical models used to calculate lifetime expected losses changes in underwriting standards financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurements among others changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers in economic conditions and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may also affect the required level of the allowance for credit losses consequently the business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations could also be affected at december the allowance for credit losses amounted to million an increase of million when compared with december given that any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain the corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate its acl the baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability followed by the pessimistic scenario the corporation evaluates at least on an annual basis the assumptions tied to the cecl accounting framework these include the reasonable and supportable period as well as the reversion window during the third quarter of as part of its evaluation procedures the corporation decided to extend the reversion window from year to years the extension in the reversion window results in a better representation of historical movements for key macroeconomic variables that impact the acl this change in assumptions contributed to a reduction of million in the acl the reasonable and supportable period assumptions remained unchanged at 2years the baseline scenario assumes a annualized gdp growth for puerto rico and the united states of and for annualized expected growth was and for puerto rico and united states respectively the reduction in is due to the expected slowdown in the economy as a result of tight monetary policy weaker job growth and persistent inflation the average unemployment rate is forecasted at and for puerto rico and united states respectively compared to average levels of for puerto rico and for the united states in weaker job growth due to the expected slowdown in the economy will contribute to the increase in unemployment rate the acl for bppr increased by million to million when compared to december mostly driven by changes in the economic scenario higher loan volumes and changes in credit quality the acl
