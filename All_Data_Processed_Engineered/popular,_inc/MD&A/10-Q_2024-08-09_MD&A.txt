certain distributions from us subsidiaries net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis nongaap financial measure net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis is a nongaap financial measure management believes that this presentation provides meaningful information since it facilitates the comparison of revenues arising from taxable and taxexempt sources the corporations interest earning assets include investment securities and loans that are exempt from income tax principally in puerto rico the main sources of taxexempt interest income are certain investments in obligations of the us government its agencies and sponsored entities certain obligations of the commonwealth of puerto rico andor its agencies and municipalities and assets held by the corporations international banking entities to facilitate the comparison of interest related to these assets the interest has been converted to a taxable equivalent basis using the applicable statutory income tax rates for each period according to the puerto rico tax law a portion of interest cost based on an equal proportion of taxexempt assets to total assets and an allocation of general and administrative expenses should be attributed to exempt income reducing the benefit of the tax exempt income and as such the disallowance of such deduction is considered in the taxable equivalent computation the effective yield on a taxable equivalent basis will vary depending on the level of these expenses that are attributed to the available exempt income net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis with its different components along with the reconciliation to net interest income gaap for the quarter ended june as compared with the same period in segregated by major categories of interest earning assets and

the use of the purchase accounting method for mergers and acquisitions tangible common equity tangible assets and other related measures should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for stockholders equity total assets or any other measure calculated in accordance with gaap moreover the manner in which the corporation calculates its tangible common equity tangible assets and other

risk management market interest rate risk the financial results and capital levels of the corporation are constantly exposed to market interest rate and liquidity risks market risk refers to the risk of a reduction in the corporations capital due to changes in the market valuation of its assets andor liabilities most of the assets subject to market valuation risk are debt securities classified as availableforsale refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the debt securities availableforsale and heldtomaturity portfolios debt securities classified as availableforsale amounted to billion as of june other assets subject to market risk include loans heldforsale which amounted to million mortgage servicing rights msrs which amounted to million and securities classified as trading which amounted to million as of june interest rate risk irr the corporations net interest income is subject to various categories of interest rate risk including repricing basis yield curve and option risks in managing interest rate risk management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities change pricing schedules adjust maturities through sales and purchases of investment securities and enter into derivative contracts among other alternatives interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate rate risk position given line of business forecasts management objectives market expectations and policy constraints management utilizes various tools to assess irr including net interest income nii simulation modeling static gap analysis and economic value of equity eve the three methodologies complement each other and are used jointly in the evaluation of the corporations irr nii simulation modeling is prepared for a fiveyear period which in conjunction with the eve analysis provides management a better view of longterm irr net interest income simulation analysis performed by legal entity and on a consolidated basis is a tool used by the corporation in estimating the potential change in net interest income resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates sensitivity analysis is calculated using a simulation model which incorporates actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity and interest yields or costs management assesses interest rate risk by comparing various nii simulations under different interest rate scenarios that differ in direction of interest rate changes the degree of change and the projected shape of the yield curve for example the types of rate scenarios processed during the quarter include flat rates implied forwards and parallel and nonparallel rate shocks management also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis and prepayment risk exposures the asset and liability management group performs validation procedures on various assumptions used as part of the simulation analyses as well as validations of results on a monthly basis in addition the model and processes used to assess irr are subject to independent validations according to the guidelines established in the model governance and validation policy the corporation processes nii simulations under interest rate scenarios in which the yield curve is assumed to rise and decline by the same magnitude parallel shifts the rate scenarios considered in these market risk simulations include instantaneous parallel changes of and basis points during the succeeding twelvemonth period simulation analyses are based on many assumptions including that the balance sheet remains flat the relative levels of market interest rates across all yield curve points and indexes interest rate spreads loan prepayments and deposit elasticity thus they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results further the estimates do not contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in interest rates additionally the corporation is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities including the basis related to using different rate indexes for the repricing of assets and liabilities as well as the effect of pricing lags which may be contractual or due to historical differences in the timing of management responses to changes in the rate environment by their nature these forwardlooking computations are only estimates and may be different from what may actually occur in the future the following table presents the results of the simulations at june and december assuming a static balance sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over a oneyear time horizon table net interest income sensitivity one year projection june december  in thousands amount change percent change amount change percent change change in interest rate basis points basis points basis points basis points as of june nii simulations show the corporation maintains an asset sensitive position that slightly increased as compared to the results as of december the primary reasons for the variation in sensitivity are changes in balance sheet composition driven by an increase in shortterm us treasury bills t bills partly offset by a reduction in overnight fed funds and us treasury notes t notes coupled with a larger loan portfolio on the asset side combined with an increase in puerto rico public sector deposits which are indexed to market rates and higher time deposits these results suggest that changes in the corporations net interest income sensitivity are driven by changes in the composition of the investment portfolio as the term bond portfolio continues to run off and get reinvested together with excess reserves in shortterm investments such as tbills additionally variations in liability cost primarily driven by puerto rico public sector deposits that represented billion or of deposits as of june as well as changes in the composition and mix of deposits also impact the sensitivity profile in the more extreme declining rate scenarios net interest income would be affected as the repricing of shortterm assets and variable rate loans slightly exceeds the benefit in cost reduction of these deposits in rising rate scenarios populars net interest income is also impacted by its large proportion of puerto rico public sector deposit however the repricing of assets as they either reset or mature lead to an increase in net interest income the corporations loan and investment portfolios are subject to prepayment risk which results from the ability of a thirdparty to repay debt obligations prior to maturity prepayment risk also could have a significant impact on the duration of mortgagebacked securities and collateralized mortgage obligations since prepayments could shorten or lower prepayments could extend the weighted average life of these portfolios trading the corporation engages in trading activities in the ordinary course of business at its subsidiaries bppr and popular securities popular securities trading activities consist primarily of marketmaking activities to meet expected customers needs related to its retail brokerage business and purchases and sales of us government and government sponsored securities with the objective of realizing gains from expected shortterm price movements bpprs trading activities consist primarily of holding us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities classified as trading and hedging the related market risk with tba tobeannounced market transactions the objective is to derive spread income from the portfolio and not to benefit from shortterm market movements in addition bppr uses forward contracts or tbas to hedge its securitization pipeline risks related to variations in interest rates and market volatility are hedged with tbas that have characteristics similar to that of the forecasted security and its conversion timeline at june the corporation held

derivatives total not on a taxable equivalent basis the corporations trading activities are limited by internal policies for each of the two subsidiaries the market risk assumed under trading

corporations trading portfolio had a 5day var of approximately million for the last week in june var models include assumptions and estimates thus actual results could differ from the outputs from these models and assumptions back testing is performed on model results to compare actual results against maximum estimated losses in order to evaluate model and assumptions accuracy in the opinion of management the size and composition of the trading portfolio does not represent a significant source of market risk for the corporation liquidity the objective of effective liquidity management is to ensure that the corporation has sufficient liquidity to meet all of its financial obligations finance expected future growth fund planned capital distributions and maintain a reasonable safety margin for cash needs under both normal and stressed market conditions the board of directors is responsible for establishing the corporations tolerance for liquidity risk including approving relevant risk limits and policies the board of directors has delegated the monitoring of these risks to the boards risk management committee and the assetliability management committee the management of liquidity risk on a longterm and daytoday basis is the responsibility of the corporate treasury division the corporations corporate treasurer is responsible for implementing the policies and procedures approved by the board of directors and for monitoring the corporations liquidity position on an ongoing basis also the corporate treasury division coordinates corporate wide liquidity management strategies and activities with the reportable segments oversees policy breaches and manages the escalation process the financial and operational risk management division is responsible for the independent monitoring and reporting of adherence with established policies an institutions liquidity may be pressured if for example it experiences a sudden and unexpected substantial cash outflow due deposit outflows whether due to a loss of confidence by depositors or other reasons including exogenous events such as the covid19 pandemic a downgrading of its credit rating or some other event that causes counterparties to avoid exposure to the institution factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook adverse ratings of its principal markets perceptions of the financial services industry and regulatory changes could also affect its ability to obtain funding the corporation has adopted policies and limits to monitor the corporations liquidity position and that of its banking subsidiaries additionally contingency funding plans are used to model various stress events of different magnitudes and affecting different time horizons that assist management in evaluating the size of the liquidity buffers needed if those stress events occur however such models may not predict accurately how the market and customers might react to every event and are dependent on many assumptions deposits including customer deposits brokered deposits and public funds deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for the corporation funding of the corporations total assets at june and december the ratio of total ending loans to deposits was at june and at december in addition to traditional deposits the corporation maintains borrowing arrangements which amounted

corporations banking subsidiaries bppr and pb or collectively the banking subsidiaries include retail commercial and public sector deposits brokered deposits unpledged investment securities mortgage loan securitization and to a lesser extent loan sales refer to table in this mda section for a breakdown of deposits by major types core deposits are generated from a large base of consumer corporate

relatively stable and lowcost funds pr public funds while linked to market interest rates provide a stable source of funding with an attractive earnings spread core deposits totaled billion or of total deposits at june compared with billion or of total deposits at december core deposits financed of the corporations earning assets at june compared with at december in addition the corporation

including deposits advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational expenses also the banking subsidiaries assume liquidity risk related to collateral posting requirements for certain activities mainly in connection with contractual commitments recourse provisions servicing advances derivatives and credit card licensing agreements the banking subsidiaries maintain sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows the corporation has established liquidity guidelines that require the banking subsidiaries to have sufficient liquidity to cover all shortterm borrowings and a portion of deposits the corporations ability to compete successfully in the marketplace for deposits excluding brokered deposits depends on various factors including pricing service convenience and financial stability as reflected by operating results and financial condition credit ratings by nationally recognized credit rating agencies customer confidence and importantly fdic deposit insurance coverage deposits at all of the corporations banking subsidiaries are federally insured subject to fdic limits and this is expected to mitigate the potential effect of the aforementioned risks the distribution by maturity of certificates of deposit with denominations of and over at june is presented in the table that follows table distribution by maturity of certificates of deposit of and over in thousands months or less over to months over year to years over years total the corporation had billion in brokered deposits at june which financed approximately of its total assets december billion and respectively in the event that any of the corporations banking subsidiaries regulatory capital ratios fall below those required by a wellcapitalized institution or are subject to capital restrictions by the regulators the corporation would be at risk that such banking subsidiary would not be able to raise or maintain brokered deposits and could also face limitations on the rate paid on deposits which may hinder the corporations ability to effectively compete in its retail markets and could affect its deposit raising efforts deposits from the public sector represent an important source of funds for the corporation as of june total puerto rico public sector deposits were billion compared to billion at december these deposits require that the bank pledges high credit quality securities as collateral therefore liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower given that the bank receives its collateral in return this now unpledged collateral can either be financed via repurchase agreements or sold for cash however timing differences between the time the deposit outflow and when the bank receives its collateral may occur additionally the corporation uses fixedrate us treasury debt securities as collateral that have limited credit risk but are nonetheless subject to market value risk based on changes in the interest rate environment when interest rates increase the value of this collateral decreases and could result in the corporation having to provide additional collateral to cover the same amount of deposit liabilities this additional collateral could reduce unpledged securities otherwise available as liquidity sources to the corporation as of june management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources to meet their anticipated cash flow obligations as well as special needs and offbalance sheet commitments in the ordinary course of business management also believes that as of june its banking subsidiaries have sufficient liquidity current and projected resources to address a stress event although the banking subsidiaries have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances no assurance can be given that they would be able to replace those funds in the future if the corporations financial condition or general market conditions were to deteriorate the corporations financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future financing needs at acceptable interest rates the corporations banking subsidiaries have to meet margin requirements on repurchase agreements and other collateralized borrowing facilities that include certain required levels of cash deposits and qualifying securities to the extent that the value of securities previously pledged as collateral declines below such required amounts because of market changes the corporation is required to deposit additional cash or securities to meet its margin requirements thereby adversely affecting its liquidity finally to the extent the corporation relies more heavily on more expensive funding sources in order to meet its future growth revenues may not increase in a manner that is proportionate to cover these costs in this case the corporations profitability would be adversely effected the corporation monitors uninsured deposits under applicable fdic regulations additionally

per quarter the bhcs have in the past borrowed in the corporate debt market primarily to finance their nonbanking subsidiaries and refinance debt obligations the issuance of corporate debt as a source of funding is likely more costly due to the fact that two out of the three principal credit rating agencies rate the corporation below investment grade which affects the corporations cost and ability to raise funds in the capital markets factors that the corporation does not control such as the economic outlook interest rate volatility inflation disruptions in the debt market among others could also affect its ability to obtain funding the corporation has an automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the securities and exchange commission which permits the corporation to

operations table above during the six months ended june the obligor group recorded a million of capital distributions from nonobligor subsidiaries which were in an accumulated loss position and accordingly were recorded as a reduction to the investments risks to liquidity total lines of credit outstanding or available borrowing capacity under lines of credit are not necessarily a measure of the total credit available on a continuing basis these lines may be subject to collateral requirements changes to the value of the collateral standards of creditworthiness leverage ratios and other regulatory requirements among other factors derivatives such as those embedded in longterm repurchase transactions or interest rate swaps and offbalance sheet exposures such as recourse performance bonds or credit card arrangements are subject to collateral requirements as their fair value increases the collateral requirements may increase thereby reducing the balance of unpledged securities the importance of the puerto rico market for the corporation is an additional risk factor that could affect its financing activities in the case of a deterioration in the outlook andor credit ratings of its principal markets andor due to regulatory changes and fiscal conditions in puerto rico that are outside the control of the corporation the credit quality of the corporation could be adversely affected and result in higher credit costs these adverse events could also affect the corporations ability to obtain funding to plan for the possibility of such a scenario management adopted contingency plans to address events that could limit or partially limit important sources of funds that are usually fully available for use these plans call for using alternate funding mechanisms such as the pledging of certain asset classes and accessing secured credit lines and loan facilities put in place with the fhlb and the frb the corporation is subject to positive tangible capital requirements to utilize secured loan facilities with the fhlb that could result in a limitation of borrowing amounts or maturity terms even if the corporation exceeds wellcapitalized regulatory capital levels the credit ratings of populars debt obligations are a relevant factor for liquidity because they impact the corporations ability to borrow in the capital markets its cost and access to funding sources credit ratings are based on the financial strength credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio the level and volatility of earnings capital adequacy the quality of management geographic concentration in puerto rico the liquidity of the balance sheet the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits and the corporations ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources among other factors furthermore various statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends an insured depository institution may pay to its holding company without regulatory approval a member bank must obtain the approval of the federal reserve board for any dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the member bank during the calendar year would exceed the combined net income for that year and the retained net income for the preceding two years net of those years dividend activity less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock in addition a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as reported in its report of condition and income unless the member bank has received the approval of the federal reserve board a member bank also may not permit any portion of its permanent capital to be withdrawn unless the withdrawal has been approved by the federal reserve board the ability of a bank subsidiary to upstream dividends to its bhc could thus be impacted by its financial performance and capital including tangible and regulatory capital thus potentially limiting the amount of cash moving up to the bhcs from the banking subsidiaries this could in turn affect the bhcs ability to declare dividends on its outstanding common and preferred stock repurchase its securities or meet its debt obligations for example during the six months ended june bppr declared cash dividends of million to pihc as of june bppr can declare a dividend of approximately million without prior approval of the federal reserve board due to its retained income declared dividend activity and transfers to statutory reserves over the measurement period pursuant to the requirements listed above pb may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the federal reserve board and the new york state department of financial services the corporations banking subsidiaries have historically not used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance its operations and therefore are less sensitive to the level and changes in the corporations overall credit ratings refer to the geographic and government risk section of this mda for some highlights on the status of the puerto rico economy and the ongoing fiscal crisis obligations subject to rating triggers or collateral requirements the corporations banking subsidiaries currently do not issue unsecured senior debt as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings the banking subsidiaries had million in deposits at june that are subject to rating triggers in addition certain mortgage servicing and custodial agreements that bppr has with third parties include rating covenants in the event of a credit rating downgrade the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for escrow deposits andor increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements the corporation services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions certain contractual agreements require the corporation to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if the institutions required credit ratings are not maintained collateral pledged by the corporation to secure recourse obligations amounted to approximately million at june the corporation could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements management expects that it would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed the requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the corporations liquidity resources and impact its operating results credit risk geographic and government risk the corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk the corporations assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements commonwealth of puerto rico a significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the commonwealth of puerto rico puerto rico which has faced severe economic and fiscal challenges in the past and may face additional challenges in the future economic performance puerto ricos economy suffered a severe and prolonged recession from to with real gross national product gnp contracting approximately during this period in hurricane maría caused significant damage and destruction across the island resulting in further economic contraction puerto ricos economy has been gradually recovering since in part aided by the large amount of federal disaster relief and recovery assistance funds injected into the puerto rico economy in connection with hurricane maría and other recent natural disasters this growth was interrupted by the economic shock caused by the covid19 pandemic in but has since resumed in part aided by additional federal assistance from pandemicrelated stimulus measures the latest puerto rico economic activity index published by the economic development bank for puerto rico the economic activity index reflected a yearoveryear decline and a monthovermonth decline in april the economic activity index is a coincident indicator of ongoing economic activity but not a direct measurement of real gnp the puerto rico planning board estimates that puerto ricos real gnp grew during fiscal year july 2023june and projects real gnp growth for fiscal year july 2024june while the puerto rico economy has not directly tracked the united states economy in recent years many of the external factors that impact the puerto rico economy are affected by the policies and performance of the united states economy these external factors include the level of interest rates and the rate of inflation inflation in the united states as measured by the united states consumer price index published by the us bureau of labor statistics increased during the 12month period ended june inflation in puerto rico as measured by the puerto rico consumer price index published by the department of labor and human resources of puerto rico increased during the 12month period ended april the rate of inflation gradually decreased from a mid2022 peak as the federal reserve implemented a series of benchmark interest rate increases fiscal challenges as the puerto rico economy contracted the governments public debt rose rapidly in part from borrowing to cover deficits to pay debt service pension benefits and other government expenditures by the puerto rico government had over billion in combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities had lost access to the capital markets and was in the midst of a fiscal crisis puerto ricos escalating fiscal and economic challenges and imminent widespread defaults in its public debt prompted the us congress to enact the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act promesa in june promesa created the oversight board with ample powers over puerto ricos fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations instrumentalities and municipalities collectively pr government entities pursuant to promesa the oversight board will be in place until market access is restored and balanced budgets are produced for at least four consecutive years promesa also established two mechanisms for the restructuring of the obligations of pr government entities a title iii which provides an in court process that incorporates many of the powers and provisions of the us bankruptcy code and permits adjustment of a broad range of obligations and b title vi which provides for a largely outofcourt process through which modifications to financial debt can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors and bind holdouts since puerto rico and several of its instrumentalities have availed themselves of the debt restructuring mechanisms of titles iii and vi of promesa the puerto rico government emerged from title iii of promesa in march several instrumentalities including government development bank for puerto rico the puerto rico sales tax financing corporation the puerto rico highways and transportation authority and the puerto rico industrial development company have also completed debt restructurings under titles iii or vi of promesa while the majority of the debt has already been restructured some pr government entities still face significant fiscal challenges for example the puerto rico electric power authority is still in the process of restructuring its debts under title iii of promesa municipalities puerto ricos fiscal and economic challenges have also adversely impacted its municipalities historically the central government provided significant annual subsidies to municipalities based on a statutory formula however as part of the fiscal measures required by the oversight board municipal subsidies have decreased significantly over several years and are now approved through specific nonrecurring appropriations this decrease has been partially offset by substantial nonrecurring federal disaster and covidrelief funding received by municipalities in recent years the latest puerto rico fiscal plan certified by the oversight board provides for the implementation of a restructured grant and transfer system through which the commonwealth would award specific service grants to municipalities to augment existing municipal service delivery while also incentivizing performance and enhanced accountability through the monitoring of outcome metrics municipalities are subject to promesa and the oversight board has the authority to require them to submit fiscal plans and annual budgets for review and approval the oversight board has imposed this requirement for certain municipalities municipalities are also required to seek oversight board approval to issue guarantee or modify their debts and to enter into contracts with an aggregate value of million or more with the oversight boards approval municipalities are also eligible to avail themselves of the debt restructuring processes provided by promesa to date however no municipality has been subject to any such debt restructuring process exposure of the corporation the credit quality of bpprs loan portfolio reflects among other things the general economic conditions in puerto rico and other adverse conditions affecting puerto rico consumers and businesses deterioration in the puerto rico economy has resulted in the past and could result in the future in higher delinquencies greater chargeoffs and increased losses which could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations at june the corporations direct exposure to pr government entities totaled million of which million were outstanding compared to million at december of which million were outstanding a deterioration in puerto ricos fiscal and economic situation could adversely affect the value of our puerto rico government obligations resulting in losses to us of the amount outstanding million consists of loans and million are securities million and million respectively at december substantially all of the corporations direct exposure outstanding at june were obligations from various puerto rico municipalities in most cases these were general obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith credit and unlimited taxing power or special obligations of a municipality to which the applicable municipality has pledged basic property tax or sales tax revenues at june of the corporations exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of san juan guaynabo carolina and caguas in july the corporation received scheduled principal payments amounting to million from various obligations from puerto rico municipalities for additional discussion of the corporations direct exposure to the puerto rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities refer to note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in addition at june the corporation had million in loans insured or securities issued by puerto rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is nongovernmental million at december these included million in residential mortgage loans insured by the puerto rico housing finance authority hfa a pr government entity december million these mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on puerto rico residential properties and the hfa insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions the corporation also had at june million in bonds issued by hfa which are secured by second mortgage loans on puerto rico residential properties and for which hfa also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions december million in the event that the mortgage loans insured by hfa and held by the corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the hfa bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans hfas ability to honor its insurance will depend among other factors on the financial condition of hfa at the time such obligations become due and payable the corporation does not consider the government guarantee when estimating the credit losses associated with this portfolio bpprs commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers lessors suppliers or have other relationships with the government these borrowers could be negatively affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and economic situation of pr government entities similarly bpprs mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees and retirees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs or reductions in pension benefits if the fiscal and economic situation deteriorates as of june bppr had billion in deposits from the puerto rico government its instrumentalities and municipalities the rate at which public deposit balances may decline is uncertain and difficult to predict the amount and timing of any such reduction is likely to be impacted by for example the speed at which federal assistance is distributed and the financial condition liquidity and cash management practices of such entities as well as on the ability of bppr to maintain these customer relationships united states virgin islands the corporation has operations in the united states virgin islands the usvi and has credit exposure to usvi government entities the usvi has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges which could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations promesa does not apply to the usvi and as such there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the usvi and its public corporations and instrumentalities to the extent that the fiscal condition of the usvi continues to deteriorate the us congress or the government of the usvi may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of usvi government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies including by making promesa applicable to the usvi at june the corporation had approximately million in direct exposure to usvi government entities december million british virgin islands the corporation has operations in the british virgin islands bvi which was negatively affected by the covid19 pandemic particularly as a reduction in the tourism activity which accounts for a significant portion of its economy although the corporation has no significant exposure to a single borrower in the bvi at june it has a loan portfolio amounting to approximately million comprised of various retail and commercial clients compared to a loan portfolio of million at december us government as further detailed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements a substantial portion of the corporations investment securities represented exposure to the us government in the form of us government sponsored entities as well as agency mortgagebacked and us treasury securities in addition billion of residential mortgages and million commercial loans were insured or guaranteed by the us government or its agencies at june

through the remaining contractual life of the different loan segments impacted by expected prepayments the acl is maintained at a sufficient level to provide for estimated credit losses on collateral dependent loans as well as loans modified for borrowers with financial difficulties separately from the remainder of the loan portfolio the corporations management evaluates the adequacy of the acl on a quarterly basis in this evaluation management considers current conditions macroeconomic economic expectations through a reasonable and supportable period historical loss experience portfolio composition by loan type and risk characteristics results of periodic credit reviews of individual loans and regulatory requirements amongst other factors the corporation must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic developments affecting specific customers industries or markets other factors that can affect managements estimates are recalibration of statistical models used to calculate lifetime expected losses changes in underwriting standards financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurements among others changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers in economic conditions and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may also affect the required level of the allowance for credit losses consequently the business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations could also be affected on june the acl was flat from december at million the acl for bppr increased by million driven by higher commercial and auto loan volume higher qualitative reserves and changes in credit quality in part offset by changes in macroeconomic scenarios and lower ncos in pb the acl decreased by million when compared to december mainly driven by lower consumer loan volumes the corporations ratio of the allowance for credit losses to loans

inherently uncertain the corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate its acl the baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability followed by the pessimistic scenario the weight assigned to the pessimistic scenario decreased during the first quarter of in response to the positive momentum in the economy as expectations for the federal reserve achieving a soft landing have improved the corporation evaluates at least on an annual basis the assumptions tied to the cecl accounting framework these include the reasonable and supportable period as well as the reversion
