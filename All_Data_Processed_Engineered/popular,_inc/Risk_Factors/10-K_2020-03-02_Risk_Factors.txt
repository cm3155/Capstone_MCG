significant portion of our business is concentrated in puerto rico where economic and fiscal challenges have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us our credit exposure is concentrated in puerto rico which accounted as of december for approximately of our revenues of our total assets and of our deposits as such our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the general trends of the puerto rico economy and in particular the residential and commercial real estate markets and asset values in puerto rico puerto rico entered recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and its gross national product gnp thereafter contracted in real terms every year between fiscal years and inclusive except fiscal year pursuant to the latest puerto rico planning board the planning board estimates published in july the commonwealths real gnp for fiscal years and decreased by and respectively the planning boards report projected an increase in real gnp of approximately and in fiscal years and respectively in part due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments that followed hurricanes irma and maría the commonwealths ability to achieve such projections however will depend to a large extent on the amount federal disaster relief funding actually received and the timing of the approval and disbursement of such funds the commonwealths government has also been facing significant fiscal challenges the structural imbalance between revenues and expenditures on the one hand and unfunded legacy pension obligations on the other hand coupled with the commonwealths inability to access financing in the capital markets or from private lenders resulted in the commonwealth and various public corporations defaulting on and eventually seeking to restructure their debts the commonwealths fiscal and economic crisis prompted the us congress to enact the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act promesa in june promesa among other things established a sevenmember federallyappointed oversight board the oversight board with broad powers over the finances of the commonwealth and its instrumentalities and provided to the commonwealth its public corporations and municipalities broadbased restructuring authority including through a bankruptcytype process similar to that of chapter of the us bankruptcy code in august president obama appointed the seven voting members of the oversight board through the process established in promesa which authorized the president to select the members from several lists required to be submitted by congressional leaders the constitutionality of such appointments however is currently being challenged before the us supreme court any outcome that results in the voidance of the oversight boards past actions could create further fiscal instability and adversely affect the puerto rico economy the credit quality of bpprs loan portfolio necessarily reflects among other things the general economic conditions in puerto rico and other adverse conditions affecting puerto rico consumers and businesses the prolonged recession resulted in limited loan demand and in an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in puerto rico the measures taken to address the fiscal crisis and those that may have to be taken in the future could affect many of our individual customers and customers businesses which could cause credit losses that adversely affect us fiscal adjustments have resulted and may continue to result in significant resistance from local politicians and other stakeholders which may lead to social and political instability any reduction in consumer spending because of these issues may also adversely impact our interest and noninterest revenues if global or local economic conditions worsen or the government of puerto rico is unable to manage its fiscal crisis including completing an orderly restructuring of its debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services those adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict and that are outside of our control under such circumstances we could experience an increase in the level of provision for loan losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses these factors could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition our assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report in this form 10k further deterioration in collateral values of properties securing our commercial mortgage loan and construction portfolios would result in increased credit losses and continue to harm our results of operations the value of properties in some of the markets we serve in particular in puerto rico declined during the past decade as a result of adverse economic

financial condition could be adversely affected by difficult conditions in the us and global financial industries during the financial crisis that commenced in market instability and lack of investor confidence led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers including other financial institutions this led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies lack of consumer confidence increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity in general the resulting economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty about the financial markets adversely affected our industry and our business results of operations and financial condition a reoccurrence of these or other difficult conditions would exacerbate the economic challenges facing us and others in the financial industry legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations popular is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by federal new york and puerto rico banking authorities any change in applicable federal new york or puert o ric o law s or regulation s coul d hav e a

a negative impact on popular furthermore the commonwealth has enacted various reforms in response to its fiscal and economic problems and is likely to implement additional reforms as part of its obligations under promesa risks relating to our business we are subject to default risk in our loan portfolio we are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans we originate or acquire we establish provisions for loan losses which lead to reductions in our income from operations in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures and guidelines this process which is critical to our financial results and condition requires difficult subjective and complex judgments about the future including forecasts of economic and market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay the loans there can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of future loan losses or that popular will not have to increase the provision for loan losses in the future as a result of future increases in nonperforming loans or for other reasons beyond our control any such increases in our provisions for loan losses or any loan losses in excess of our provisions for loan losses would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and result of operations we will continue to evaluate our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and may be required to increase such amounts the fiscal and economic challenges of some of the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our portfolio of government securities and our loans to government entities in such jurisdictions as well as the value and performance of commercial mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action in such jurisdictions a reduction in puerto rico government deposits could also adversely affect our net interest income we have direct and indirect lending and investment exposure to the puerto rico government its public corporations and municipalities a deterioration of the commonwealths fiscal and economic condition including as a result of actions taken by the commonwealth government or the oversight board to address the ongoing fiscal and economic crisis in puerto rico could materially adversely affect the value and performance of our puerto rico government obligations as well as the value and performance of commercial mortgage and consumer loans to private borrowers who have significant relationships with the government or could be directly affected by government action resulting in losses to us at december our direct exposure to puerto rico government obligations was limited to obligations from various municipalities and amounted to million of the amount outstanding at december million consisted of loans and million consisted of securities these municipal obligations are mostly general obligations backed by property tax revenues and to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith credit and unlimited taxing power or special obligations to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues at december of our exposure to municipal loans and securities was concentrated in the municipalities of san juan guaynabo carolina and bayamón in may the oversight board designated all municipalities as covered entities under promesa for a discussion of the implications of being designated a covered entity under promesa refer to the geographic and government risk section in the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of the annual report the commonwealths certified fiscal plan does not contemplate a restructuring of the debts of puerto ricos municipalities the plan however provides for the gradual phase out of commonwealth appropriations to municipalities which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of certain municipalities since fiscal year commonwealth appropriations to municipalities have been reduced by approximately from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year the commonwealth fiscal plan provides for additional reductions in appropriations to municipalities every fiscal year holding appropriations constant at million starting in fiscal year before ultimately phasing out all appropriations in fiscal year although the certified fiscal plan contemplates that the reduction in subsidies may be offset by other measures the reduction in subsidies could have a material negative impact on the financial condition of various municipalities particularly if such offsetting measures are not fully or timely implemented furthermore municipalities may also be affected by the negative effects resulting from other expense revenue or cash management measures taken to address the commonwealths fiscal and liquidity shortfalls in addition at december the corporation had million in loans insured or securities issued by puerto rico governmental entities but for which the principal source of repayment is nongovernmental these included million in residential mortgage loans insured by the puerto rico housing finance authority hfa a governmental instrumentality that has been designated as a covered entity under promesa these mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on puerto rico residential properties and the hfa insurance covers losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions the corporation also had at december million in bonds issued by hfa which are secured by second mortgage loans on puerto rico residential properties and for which hfa also provides insurance to cover losses in the event of a borrower default and upon the satisfaction of certain other conditions in the event that the mortgage loans insured by hfa and held by the corporation directly or those serving as collateral for the hfa bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans hfas ability to honor its insurance will depend among other factors on the financial condition of hfa at the time such obligations become due and payable although the governor is currently authorized by local legislation to impose a temporary moratorium on the financial obligations of the hfa she has not exercised this power as of the date hereof in addition at december the corporation had million in securities issued by hfa that have been economically defeased and refunded and for which securities consisting of us agencies and treasury obligations have been escrowed and million of commercial real estate notes issued by government entities but that are payable from rent paid by nongovernmental parties bpprs commercial loan portfolio also includes loans to private borrowers who are service providers lessors suppliers or have other relationships with the puerto rico government these borrowers could be negatively affected by the fiscal measures to be implemented to address the commonwealths fiscal crisis and the ongoing debt restructuring proceedings under promesa similarly bpprs mortgage and consumer loan portfolios include loans to government employees which could also be negatively affected by fiscal measures such as employee layoffs or furloughs furthermore bppr has a significant amount of deposits from the commonwealth its instrumentalities and municipalities the amount of such deposits may fluctuate depending on the financial condition and liquidity of such entities as well as on the ability of bppr to maintain these customer relationships a portion of such deposits could also be used by the commonwealth as part of its restructuring agreements under title iii of promesa while a significant decrease in these deposits should not materially affect our liquidity since such deposits are collateralized a significant decrease in the amount of such deposits could adversely affect our net interest income bppr also has operations in the usvi and has credit exposure to usvi government entities at december bpprs direct exposure to usvi instrumentalities and public corporations amounted to approximately million of which million is outstanding the usvi has been experiencing a number of fiscal and economic challenges that could adversely affect the ability of its public corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding debt obligations promesa does not apply to the usvi and as such there is currently no federal legislation permitting the restructuring of the debts of the usvi and its public corporations and instrumentalities to the extent that the fiscal condition of the usvi continues to deteriorate the us congress or the government of the usvi may enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the financial obligations of usvi government entities or imposing a stay on creditor remedies including by making promesa applicable to the usvi the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions

transaction s expos e u s t o credi t ris k i n th e even t of defaul t of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized

exposures with other financial institutions and monitor these on a regular basis nonetheless market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by us and result in losses our ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence in times when market confidence is affected by events related to wellknown financial institutions risk aversion among participants may increase substantially and make it more difficult for us to borrow in the credit or capital markets our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time receive requests for information from departments of the us and puerto rico governments including those that investigate mortgagerelated conduct our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and we from time to time selfreport compliance matters to or receive requests for information from departments of the us and puerto rico governments in particular bppr has received subpoenas and other requests for information from the departments of the us government that investigate mortgagerelated conduct mainly concerning real estate appraisals and residential and construction loans in puerto rico bppr has also selfidentified and reported to applicable regulators matters with respect to mortgage related practices for example in july management learned that certain letters related to approximately residential mortgage loans generated by popular to comply with bureau of consumer financial protection cfpb rules requiring written notification to borrowers who have submitted a loss mitigation application were not mailed to borrowers over a period of up to approximately threeyears due to a systems interface error loss mitigation is a process whereby creditors work with mortgage loan borrowers who are having difficulties making their loan payments on their debt popular corrected the systems interface error that caused the letters not to be sent notified applicable regulators including the cfpb completed a review of its mortgage files to assess the scope of potential customer impact and conducted outreach and remediation efforts with respect to borrowers potentially affected by the systems interface error incidents of this nature andor investigations by governmental authorities whether arising from these incidents or otherwise may result in judgments settlements fines enforcement actions penalties or other sanctions adverse to the corporation which could materially and adversely affect the corporations business financial condition or results of operations or cause serious reputational harm we are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject to recourse arrangements popular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time

instruments reforms to and uncertainty regarding the london interbank offered rate libor may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our business and financial performance are impacted by market interest rates and movements in those rates since a high percentage of our assets and liabilities are interest bearing or otherwise sensitive in value to changes in interest rates changes in rates in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different types of rates can have a material impact on our results of operations and the values of our assets and liabilities if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments our net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected interest rates are also highly sensitive to many factors over which we have no control and which we may not be able to anticipate adequately including general economic conditions and the monetary and tax policies of various governmental bodies particularly the federal reserve for a discussion of the corporations interest rate sensitivity please refer to the risk management section of the managements discussion and analysis of this annual report on form 10k on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after it is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next several years as a result of this transition interest rates on floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments held by the corporation and tied to libor rates as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments may be adversely affected any failure by market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace libor and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of libor could also result in disruption in the financial markets further any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of libor as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates regulators industry groups and certain committees eg the alternative reference rates committee have among other things published recommended fallback language for liborlinked financial instruments identified recommended alternatives for certain libor rates eg the secured overnight financing rate as the recommended alternative to us dollar libor and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments at this time it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted whether they will continue to evolve and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floatingrate financial instruments if our goodwill

accounting standards established by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission as well as more detailed accounting policies established by the corporations management from time to time these accounting standards or accounting policies may change and in some cases these changes could have a material effect on the corporations financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results for example beginning january the corporation and other us companies were required to implement a new accounting standard commonly referred to as the current expected credit losses cecl framework which requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments replacing the incurred loss model the corporation expects that under cecl it will need to among other things increase the allowance for loan and lease losses which may have a negative impact on the corporations capital levels this new accounting standard may present operational challenges and will require the corporation to change how it makes assumptions and estimates on loan and lease losses as well as other financial assets also this new accounting standard may result in greater volatility of the corporations earnings and capital levels and could potentially affect the corporations capital distribution plans depending upon final guidance from regulators for additional information on this and other accounting standards see note new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report in this form 10k our compensation practices are subject to oversight by applicable regulators our success depends in large part on our ability to retain key senior leaders and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve board we also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the fdic or other regulators which may or may not affect our competitors the doddfrank act requires the us financial regulators including the federal reserve board the other federal banking agencies and the sec to adopt rules prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss at specified regulated entities having at least billion in total assets including popular pna bppr and pb the us financial regulators

laws and regulations can increase our operational and compliance costs and risks if we and our subsidiaries affiliates or thirdparty service providers are found to have failed to comply with applicable economic sanctions programs and antimoney laundering laws and regulations we could be exposed to fines sanctions and other penalties as well as governmental investigations as a regulated financial institution we must comply with regulations and federal economic and trade sanctions and embargo programs administered by the office of foreign assets control ofac of the us treasury as well as antimoney laundering laws and regulations including those under the bank secrecy act economic and trade sanctions regulations and programs administered by ofac prohibit usbased entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with for the benefit of or in some cases involving the property and property interests of persons governments or countries designated by the us government under one or more sanctions regimes and also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit that is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes we are also subject to a variety of reporting and other requirements under the bank secrecy act including the requirement to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports that are designed to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering terrorist financing and other criminal activities in addition as a financial institution we are required to among other things identify our customers adopt formal and comprehensive antimoney laundering programs scrutinize or altogether prohibit certain transactions of special concern and be prepared to respond to inquiries from us law enforcement agencies concerning our customers and their transactions failure by the corporation its subsidiaries affiliates or thirdparty service providers to comply with these laws and regulations could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the corporation including the possibility of regulatory enforcement or other legal action including significant civil and criminal penalties we can also incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating our businesses to comply with these requirements the markets in which we operate heighten these costs and risks we have established riskbased policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with these applicable laws and regulations with respect to ofac regulations and economic sanction programs these policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for evidence of sanctionedcountry and persons involvement consistent with a riskbased approach and the difficulties in identifying and where applicable blocking and rejecting transactions of our customers or our customers customers that may involve a sanctioned person government or country there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage and such violations could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations various state and municipal governments universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business involving sanctioned countries or entities and a violation of applicable us laws and regulations could adversely affect the market for our securities from time to time we have identified and voluntarily selfdisclosed to ofac transactions that were not timely identified and blocked by our policies and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by ofac there can be no assurances that any failure to comply with us sanctions and embargoes or with antimoney laundering laws and regulations will not result in material fines sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us furthermore if the policies and procedures of one of the corporations thirdparty service providers do not prevent it from violating applicable laws and regulations in transactions in which it engages such violations could adversely affect its ability to provide services to us and in the case of evertec could adversely affect the value of our investment in evertec risks relating to our operations we are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that if realized could adversely affect how we conduct our business information security risks for large financial institutions such as popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates hacktivists and other parties in the ordinary course of business we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data we employ a defensive approach that employs people processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls we employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor block and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity as well as to identify suspected advanced persistent threats notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective especially as the threat from cyberattacks is continuous and severe attacks are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures we have been the target of phishing scams in the past targeting our customers as a result of compromised email accounts of several popular employees we have addressed the vulnerabilities that permitted the compromise and implemented enhanced security measures and will continue to take appropriate steps in the future to improve the security of our systems there can be no assurances however that there will not be further breaches of sensitive customer information in the future the most significant cyber attac k risk s tha t w e ma y fac e ar e e fraud denialofservice ransomware and computer intrusion that might result in loss of customer or proprietary data loss from e fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds from customer or bank accounts denialofservice disrupts services available to our customers through our online banking system computer intrusion attempts might result in the breach of sensitive customer data suc h a s accoun t number s an d socia l securit y numbers an d coul d presen t significan t reputational lega l andor regulator y cost s t o popula r i f successful risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our customers although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties we have not to date experienced any material losses as a result of cyberattacks a successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences for us including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients customers and counterparties misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients customers counterparties or employees or damage to computers or systems of us and those of our clients customers and counterparties and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to us or to our customers loss of confidence in our security measures customer dissatisfaction significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on us in particular if personal nonpublic confidential or proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled or misused we could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss for a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards see regulation and supervision in part i item business included in this annual report such mishandling or misuse could include for example if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either by fault of our systems employees or counterparties or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information technology and business process services the most important of these thirdparty service providers for us is evertec and certain risks particular to evertec are discussed below under risks relating to our relationship with evertec the success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties suppliers or vendors socalled fourth party risk we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourthparty risk in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing information security recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services internet connections and network access the most important of these thirdparty service providers for us is evertec and certain risks particular to evertec are discussed below under risks relating to our relationship with evertec while we select thirdparty vendors carefully we do not control their actions any problems caused by these third parties including those resulting from disruptions in services provided by a vendor breaches of a vendors systems failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services or failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business financial or operational difficulties of a thirdparty vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendors ability to serve us replacing these thirdparty vendors could also create significant delay and expense accordingly use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations in addition the assessment and management by financial institutions of the risks associated with third party vendors have been subject to greater regulatory scrutiny we expect to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with our oversight of third party relationships especially those involving significant banking functions shared services or other critical activities our failure to properly manage risks associated to our third party relationships could result in potential liability to clients and customers fines penalties or judgments imposed by our regulators increased operating expenses and harm to our reputation any of which could materially and adversely affect us unforeseen or catastrophic events including extreme weather events and other natural disasters manmade disasters or the emergence of pandemics could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations extreme weather events could be exacerbated by climate change the occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events in the markets in which we do business including extreme weather events and other natural disasters manmade disasters or the emergence of pandemics could cause a disruption in our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a significant portion of our operations are located in puerto rico the usvi and bvi a region susceptible to hurricanes earthquakes and other similar events for example in our operations in puerto rico the usvi and bvi were significantly disrupted by the impact of hurricanes irma and maría in january puerto rico was impacted by a magnitude earthquake which caused islandwide power outages and significant damage to infrastructure and property in the southwest region of the island future natural disasters can again cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we maintain insurance against natural disasters including coverage for lost profits and extra expense however there is no insurance against the disruption that a catastrophic natural disaster could produce to the markets that we serve and the potential negative impact to economic activity further future natural disasters in any of our market areas could again adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may further adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us manmade disasters pandemics and other events connected with the regions in which we operate could have similar effects for example a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in wuhan china in december resulting in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region instances of coronavirus have begun to spread around the world the impact of the coronavirus on our business is uncertain at this time and will depend on future developments but prolonged closures may disrupt our operations and the operations of our suppliers service providers and customers which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition the severity and impact of future hurricanes earthquakes pandemics and other similar events are difficult to predict and in particular in the case of hurricanes may be exacerbated by global climate change the effects of climate change could also adversely impact the financial condition of our clients or the value of any collateral held by us which could also have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations risks related to acquisition transactions potential acquisitions of businesses or loan portfolios could increase some of the risks that we face and may be delayed or prohibited due to regulatory constraints to the extent permitted by our applicable regulators we will pursue strategic acquisition opportunities acquiring other banks or businesses however involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company potential disruption to our business the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company and difficulty in estimating the value of the target company if in connection with an acquisition we pay a premium over book or market value some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations similarly acquiring loan portfolios involves various risks when acquiring loan portfolios management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loans including the creditworthiness of borrowers and th e valu e of th e rea l estat e an d othe r asset s servin g a s collatera l for th e repaymen t of secure d loans in estimating the extent of the loss es we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience volume and classification of loans volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals local economic conditions and other pertinent information if our assumptions are incorrect however our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased los s reserve s ma y b e neede d t o respon d t o differen t economi c condition s or advers e development s i n th e acquire d loa n portfolios which would negatively affect our operating results finally certain acquisitions by financial institutions including us are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies regulatory approvals could be delayed impeded restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have we may fail to pursue evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability or perceived or anticipated inability to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner under reasonable conditions or at all difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the failure to successfully integrate reliables business and operations may adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits and could adversely affect our results of operations incorrect assumptions and judgements regarding the fair value of the assets acquired could negatively affect our operating results on august popular auto llc banco popular de puerto ricos auto finance subsidiary completed the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities related to wells fargo companys wells fargo auto finance business in puerto rico reliable our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisition including synergies and operational efficiencies in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect will depend on the effective and timely transition and integration of reliables business and operations problems may arise in successfully integrating reliables business and operations including without limitation unexpected costs as a result of any unrecorded liabilities or issues not identified during the due diligence investigation of the business and that may not be subject to indemnification or reimbursement under the acquisition agreement any failure to comply with banking and consumer protection laws and regulations and any adverse effects on our ability to maintain relationships with customers employees and service providers the failure to successfully transfer and integrate reliables business and operations may adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits and could adversely affect our results of operations furthermore as part of the transition and integration we may find that our assumptions and judgements regarding the fair value of the assets acquired including the collectability of the loans and value of the collateral could be inaccurate causing our actual losses to be higher than estimated negatively affecting our operating results risks relating to our relationship with evertec we are dependent on evertec for certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology services which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us in connection with the sale of a ownership interest in evertec in the third quarter of we entered into a longterm amended and restated master services agreement the msa with evertec pursuant to which we agreed to receive from evertec on an exclusive basis certain core banking and financial transaction processing and information technology services the term of the msa extends until september under the msa we also granted evertec a right of first refusal over certain services or products and development projects related to the services thereunder provided we also entered into several other agreements generally coterminous with the msa pursuant to which bppr agreed to sponsor evertec as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card associations agreed to certain exclusivity and nonsolicitation restrictions with respect to merchant services and agreed to support the ath brand and network among other matters as a result we are now dependent on evertec for the provision of essential services to our business including our core banking business and there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate or that evertec will be able to continue to provide us with the necessary financial transaction processing and technology services as a result our relationship with evertec exposes us to a number of operational cybersecurity and business risks that could have a material adverse effect on us as a result of our agreements with evertec we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of evertec including those relating to a breakdown or failure of evertecs systems or internal controls environment as a result of security breaches or attacks employee error or malfeasance system breakdowns vulnerabilities or otherwise over the term of the msa we have experienced various interruptions and delays in key services provided by evertec future interruptions in the operation of evertecs information systems or cyberattacks to or breaches to the confidentiality of the information that resides in such systems could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services expose us to regulatory legal and compliance risk and damage our reputation which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding our cybersecurity risks refer to the we are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that if realized could adversely affect how we conduct our business risk factor our ability to recover from evertec for breach of the msa may not fully compensate us for the damages we may suffer as a result of such breach if evertec is unable to meet constant technological changes and evolving industry standards we may be unable to enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and costeffective manner placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business financial condition and results of operations the banking and financial services industry is rapidly evolving and it is highly competitive on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered innovation price and other factors in order to compete effectively we need to constantly develop enhancements to our product and service offerings and introduce new products and services that keep pace with developments in the financial services industry and satisfy shifting customer needs and preferences these enhancements and new products and services require the delivery of technology services by evertec pursuant to the msa making our success dependent on evertecs ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a costeffective manner some of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than evertec and that may have better technological capabilities and product offerings furthermore evertec is highly leveraged which besides exposing it to a number of financial and business risks requires it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to meeting debt service requirements reducing its operational flexibility and ability to invest resources in capital and other expenditures to improve and develop its business services in a constantly changing environment in addition financial services technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements and in most cases such costs are borne by the technology provider because of our relationship with evertec however we may be required to bear the full cost of such developments and modifications pursuant to the msa if evertecs technology services are not competitive in terms of price speed and scalability versus comparable offerings from larger companies our future success may be adversely affected furthermore if our relationship with evertec hinders our ability to compete successfully including by satisfying shifting customer needs and preferences through enhancements to our existing products and services and the introduction of new products and services that keep pace with developments in the financial services industry our ability to attract and retain customers and to match products and services offered by competitors could be impaired and our business financial condition and results of operations could be harmed our ability to transition to a new financial services technology provider and to replace the other services that are provided to us by evertec may be lengthy and complex switching from one vendor of core bank processing and related technology services to a new vendor is a complex process that carries business and financial risks even where such a switch can be accomplished without violating our contractual obligations to evertec the implementation cycle for such a transition can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us such a transition can also expose us and our clients to increased costs including conversion costs and business disruption if we decided to transition to a new financial services technology provider either at the end of the term of the msa and related agreements or earlier upon the occurrence of an early termination thereunder these potential transition risks could result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations although evertec has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the msa we are ultimately dependent on their ability to provide those services in a responsive and competent manner furthermore we may require transition assistance from evertec beyond the term of the msa delaying and lengthening any transition process away from evertec while increasing related costs under the msa we are required to provide written notice of nonrenewal no less than one year prior to the relevant termination date in order to avoid an automatic threeyear renewal in practice however if we decided to switch to a new provider we would have to commence procuring and working on a transition process much earlier and such process may extend beyond the current term of the msa furthermore if we were unsuccessful or decided not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources it could also result in an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the value of our remaining ownership interest in evertec and the revenues we derive from evertec could be materially reduced if we decided not to renew our agreements with evertec or were to terminate them before the expiration of their term we continue to have a ownership interest in evertec and account for this investment under the equity method as such we include our investment in evertec in other assets and our proportionate share of income or loss is included in other operating income in our consolidated statements of operations for our share of evertecs changes in equity recognized in income was million the carrying value of our investment in evertec was as of december approximately million meanwhile the services evertec delivers to us represent a significant portion of evertecs revenues approximately for as a result if we were not to renew the msa and our other agreements with evertec or otherwise terminate them before the end of their term evertecs financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the value of our remaining ownership interest in evertec and the income we report from this investment may be materially reduced furthermore revenue from evertecs merchant acquiring business which constitutes approximately of evertecs revenues depends in part on evertecs alliance with bppr if such relationship were to suffer evertecs business may be adversely affected furthermore future sales of our evertec common stock or the perception that these sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of evertec common stock and thus the value we may be able to realize on the sale of our remaining holdings risks relating to an investment in our securities the issuance of additional shares of equity securities could further dilute existing holders of our common stock we have not issued equity securities since other than in connection with compensation plans or our dividend reinvestment plan in the future however we may raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations or expansions to pursue acquisitions or to increase our capital to comply with regulatory capital measures if we raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders would be reduced the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our common stock or outstanding preferred stock and the issuance could be at a price which is dilutive to current stockholders dividends on our common stock and preferred stock may be suspended and stockholders may not receive funds in connection with their investment in our common stock or preferred stock without selling their shares holders of our common stock and preferred stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally availabl e for suc h payments durin g w e suspende d dividen d payment s on ou r common stoc k an d preferre d stock w e resume d paymen t of dividends on our preferred stock in december and on our common stock in october there can be no assurance that any dividends will be declared on the preferred stock or common stock in any future periods this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and preferred stock also we are a bank holding company and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations including the guidelines of the federal reserve board regarding capital adequacy and dividends it is federal reserve board policy that bank holding companies should pay dividends on common stock only out of the net income available to common stock over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organizations current and expected future capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition in addition the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities held by each trust that has issued trust preferred securities prohibit us from declarin g or payin g an y dividend s or distribution s on ou r capita l stock includin g ou r common stoc k an d preferre d stock or fro m purchasing acquiring

l perio d i s continuing accordingly stockholders may have to sell some or all of their shares of our common stock or preferred stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment stockholders may not realize a gain on their investment when they sell the common stock or preferred stock and may lose the entire amount of their investment certain of the provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation have the effect of making it more difficult to change the board of directors and may make the board of directors less responsive to stockholder control our certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the board of directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible at each annual meeting of stockholders one thir d of th e member s of th e boar d of director s wil l b e electe d for a three year term and the other directors will remain in office until their three year terms expire therefore control of the board of directors cannot be changed in one year and at least two annual meetings must be held before a majority of the members of the board of directors can be changed our certificate of incorporation also provides that a director or the entire board of directors may be removed by the stockholder s onl y for caus e b y a vot e of a t leas t tw o third s of th e combine d votin g powe r of th e outstandin g capita l

might realize in for example a tender offer for our capital stock for further information of other risks faced by popular please refer to the managements discussion analysis section of the annual
