item risk factors in addition to the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed under part i item risk factors in our form 10k and under part ii item risk factors of any subsequent quarterly report on form 10q these factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and capital position and could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report also refer to the discussion in part i item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report for additional information that may supplement or update the discussion of the risk factors below and in our form 10k and any subsequent quarterly reports on form 10q the risks described in our form 10k and in our quarterly reports on form 10q are not the only risks facing us additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and capital position there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed under part i item a risk factors in our form 10k except for the risks included below which supplement the risk factors described in our form 10k we are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that if realized may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations these cybersecurity risks have been heightened by the increase on our employees remote work capabilities and in the use of digital channels by our customers as a result of the covid19 pandemic information security risks for large financial institutions such as popular have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies such as internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates hacktivists and other parties in the ordinary course of business we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to transmit and store sensitive data we employ a layered defensive approach that employs people processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls through a variety of preventative and detective tools that monitor block and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity and identify suspected advanced persistent threats notwithstanding our defensive measures and the significant resources we devote to protect the security of our systems there is no assurance that all of our security measures will be effective at all times especially as the threats from cyberattacks is continuous and severe t he risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future as we continue to expand our mobile banking and other internetbased product offerings and populars internal use of internetbased products and applications we continue to detect and identify attacks that are becoming more sophisticated and increasing in volume as well as attackers that respond rapidly to changes in defensive countermeasures we have been the target of phishing attacks in the past targeting both our customers and employees through brand and email impersonation that have compromised the email accounts of certain of our customers and employees we continually monitor and address those vulnerabilities and continue to enhance our security measures to detect and prevent such events while enhancing employee and customer trainings and awareness campaigns there can be no assurances however that there will not be further compromises of sensitive customer information in the future furthermore increased use of remote access and thirdparty video conferencing solutions during the covid19 pandemic to facilitate workfromhome arrangements for employees and facilitating the use of digital channels by our customers could increase our exposure to cyber attacks in addition a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by populars employees the most significant cyberattack risks that we may face are efraud denialofservice ransomware and computer intrusion that might result in disruption of services and in the exposure or loss of customer or proprietary data loss from efraud occurs when cybercriminals compromise our systems and extract funds from customers credit cards or bank accounts denialofservice disrupts services available to our customers through our online banking system computer intrusion attempts might result in the compromise of sensitive customer data such as account numbers and social security numbers and could present significant reputational legal and regulatory costs to popular if successful risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as the expanding use of digital channels for banking such as mobile banking and other technologybased products and services used by us and our customers although we are regularly targeted by unauthorized parties we have not to date experienced any material losses as a result of any cyberattacks a successful compromise or circumvention of the security of our systems could have serious negative consequences for us including significant disruption of our operations and those of our clients customers and counterparties misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients customers counterparties or employees or damage to computers or systems used by us or by our clients customers and counterparties and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to us or to our customers loss of confidence in our security measures customer dissatisfaction significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on us for example if personal nonpublic confidential or proprietary information in our possession were to be mishandled misused or stolen we could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss the extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed while such an investigation is ongoing popular may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack and that damage may continue to spread these factors may inhibit our ability to provide rapid full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients customers counterparties and regulators as well as the public furthermore it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack for a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards see regulation and supervision in part i item business included in our form 10k such mishandling or misuse could include for example if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either by fault of our systems employees or counterparties or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties we rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions and the provision of information security technology and business process services as a result a successful compromise or circumvention of the security of the systems of these thirdparty service providers could have serious negative consequences for us including misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients customers counterparties or employees or other negative implications identified above with respect to a cyber attack on our systems which could have a material adverse effect on us the most important of these thirdparty service providers for us is evertec and certain risks particular to evertec are discussed under part i item a risk factors in our form 10k during we determined that as a result of the widely reported breach of accellion incs file transfer appliance tool which was being used at the time of such breach by a usbased thirdparty advisory services vendor of popular personal information of certain popular customers was compromised as a result popular has notified as required or otherwise deemed appropriate customers identified as affected by the incident although we are not aware of fraudulent activity in connection with this incident populars networks and systems were not impacted and our thirdparty service provider has agreed to cover external remediation costs associated with the incident a compromise of the personal information of our customers maintained by third party vendors could result in significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss to us the success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of these and other third parties to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely affected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third parties suppliers or vendors socalled fourth party risk we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate fourthparty risk in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the third parties that perform functions and services for us as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones including risks associated with supply chain compromises and the software development lifecycle of the systems used by us and our service providers due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition addressing certain information security vulnerabilities such as hardwarebased vulnerabilities may affect the performance of our information technology systems the ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors if populars operational systems or those of external parties on which populars businesses depend are unable to meet the requirements of our businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings popular could be materially and adversely affected
