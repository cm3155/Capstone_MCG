will now turn the call over to our ceo ignacio alvarez ignacio alvarez chief executive officer director popular inc good morning and thank you for joining the call in the third quarter we achieved net income of million a decrease of million from the second quarter these results were primarily driven by a higher provision for credit losses which was partly a result of loan growth at bppr credit quality trends remained stable in the period net interest income increased by million compared to the second quarter while this was below what we had anticipated it was largely the result of a billion reduction in deposit levels at bppr which impacted the balance and mix of earning assets that said average retail customer deposit balances remained approximately above prepandemic levels and we continue to add new deposit clients during the quarter going forward we expect to continue to benefit from the repricing of our investment portfolio and loan originations we achieved strong loan growth in the quarter with balances increasing by million or nearly bprs sic bpprs loan portfolio grew by million primarily in the commercial segment but reflecting growth across almost all lending categories popular bank saw a million increase in loan balances driven by commercial loans our net interest margin expanded by basis points to mainly driven by higher average loan balances and the repricing of loans and reinvestment of securities in a higher interest rate environment this was partially offset by higher deposit costs and a lower average balance of investment securities operating expenses decreased by million to million during the quarter we repurchased of our shares for approximately million we continue to believe that our shares are attractive to repurchase at current prices tangible book value per share increased by to driven by lower unrealized losses in our investment portfolio please turn to slide business activity in puerto rico remains solid as reflected in the favorable trends in total employment consumer spending and other economic data consumer spending remained healthy combined credit and debit card sales for bppr customers increased by approximately compared to the third quarter of our auto loan and lease balances increased by million compared to the second quarter as demand for new cars continue to be strong in puerto rico mortgage loan balances at bppr increased by million in the third quarter driven primarily by home purchase activity and our existing strategy of retaining fha loans in portfolio the tourism and hospitality sector continue to be a source of strength for the local economy passenger traffic at the san juan international airport increased by in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of and hotel occupancy continues to be healthy there is a significant amount of committed federal funds that have yet to be disbursed the disbursement of these funds will continue to support economic activities for several

our financial results jorge j garcía executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc thank you ignacio good morning and thank you all for joining the call today please turn to slide popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 as ignacio stated we reported net income of million in the third quarter million lower than the prior periods results net interest income increased by million this increase was below what we had expected the lower nii was driven primarily by an unanticipated decrease in deposits in puerto rico which impacted the balance of higher yielding taxexempt tbills in our investment portfolio ending customer deposit balances at bppr excluding puerto rico public deposits decreased by million in ending balances and by approximately billion in average balances during the quarter primarily in lowcost interestbearing deposit accounts from the beginning of march and through most of the second quarter retail deposit balances in bppr benefited from tax refunds of more than billion during  in addition to continued outflows of deposit balances driven by rateseeking behavior among our commercial and affluent retail deposit customers we also saw a significant increase in spending and use of these balances across our retail client base reversing the increase in average deposit balances we saw in  at quarters end average retail deposit balances at bppr are still approximately higher than prepandemic levels down from a peak of roughly that we saw in  at the end of the third quarter puerto rico public deposits were billion down billion compared to  and slightly above the upper end of our yearend guidance range average public deposit balances were higher during the quarter as the bulk of the reduction occurred on the last day of the quarter going forward we expect public deposits to be in a range of billion to billion while we do not anticipate this level of contraction on our deposit balances the benefits of investment repricing stable nonpublic deposit costs and loan growth in the quarter contributed to a million increase in net interest income despite the reduction in the investment portfolio our net interest margin expanded by basis points on a gaap basis driven by loan growth and by the repricing of loans and securities nim on a tax equivalent basis contracted by basis point primarily resulting from lower balances of taxexempt securities and higher levels of disallowed deposit expense loan growth was solid increasing by million in the quarter driven by activity at bppr where we saw increases across nearly all categories led by commercial lending auto and mortgage originations noninterest income was million a decrease of million from  driven primarily by lower income from mortgage banking activities as a result of a decrease in the fair value of msrs we continue to expect noninterest income to be approximately million million in  were pleased to see that credit metrics remained stable during the third quarter the provision for credit losses of million although million higher than the second quarter increased in part due to loan growth during the quarter in addition to chargeoff activity in the consumer loan portfolio total operating expenses were million or million lower than last quarter driven by lower professional fees and reserves for operational losses offset in part by higher technology costs related to our transformation efforts and higher personnel expenses due to annual merit increases we expect total fullyear expenses of approximately billion within the range of our original guidance of billion to billion our effective tax rate was compared to in the prior quarter driven by the lower taxexempt income we now expect an effective tax rate for the year of at the top end of our prior guidance range of to popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 please turn to slide during the quarter we began to reinvest investment maturities in two to threeyear us treasury notes buying approximately billion at an average yield of we expect to continue this strategy as a way to hedge against lower rates in bppr deposit costs increased by basis points to the deposit costs at bppr continued to be impacted by the proportion of public deposits to total deposits as discussed last quarter approximately million of lowcost governmentrelated accounts managed by our fiduciary services group were repriced during the last months of the second quarter to marketlinked rates the full effect of that adjustment is reflected in our  deposit cost run rate and margin at popular bank deposit costs decreased by basis points during the quarter this change reflects a reduction in the cost of intercompany deposits the underlying economic activity and demand for credit in puerto rico remained strong in our us markets we have begun to see a pickup in the demand for credit as a result we now expect consolidated loan growth in the fourth quarter of approximately this will result in total loan growth in of approximately within the original to guidance range for the year we anticipate fourth quarter nii will increase by approximately to compared to  driven by continued reinvestment of securities and loan originations coupled with the beginning of the repricing of puerto rico public deposits and online deposits at popular bank this will result in a yearoveryear growth in nii of approximately to below our previous to guidance additionally we expect nim expansion to reaccelerate in  and continue into our deposit mix and our ability to reduce the cost of deposits in the us and the volume and cost of public deposits in puerto rico will continue to present the biggest risk to achieving the expected level of expansion in nim please turn to slide regulatory capital levels remained strong our cet1 ratio of decreased by basis points from  mainly due to an increase in riskweighted assets tangible book value per share at the end of the quarter was an increase of per share from  mostly resulting from the decreased aoci and our quarterly net income offset in part by dividends and stock repurchase activity during the quarter during the last two months of the quarter as part of the previouslyannounced common stock repurchase authorization we repurchased approximately  for roughly million or an average price of about per share return on tangible common equity for the quarter was a reduction from the last quarter driven by the higher provision expense and higher effective tax rate as we look forward to given a variety of drivers including the impact of the reduction in deposit balances experienced this year the mix shift to higher cost deposits along with the limited loan growth yeartodate in the us we no longer expect to achieve our target of rotce by the end of  we now anticipate that we should be able to generate at least a rotce in the fourth quarter of longer term we as a management team continue to be focused on achieving a sustainable return on tangible common equity we are confident that our transformation efforts the repricing of our investment portfolio and loan demand in all of our markets will be important catalysts to achieve this target over time with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 thank you jorge and good morning credit quality metrics remained stable through the third quarter the corporations mortgage and commercial portfolios continued to reflect credit metrics significantly below pre pandemic levels consumer portfolios reflected increased delinquencies and net chargeoffs driven by the auto loan portfolio delinquencies and net chargeoff in this portfolio have gradually increased but remained slightly below pre pandemic levels we are closely monitoring changes in the macroeconomic environment and on borrower performance given higher interest rates and inflationary pressures we believe that the improvements over recent years in risk management practices and the risk profile of the corporation loans portfolio positions popular to continue to operate successfully under the current environment turning to slide number nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans increased during the quarter driven by popular bank npls in popular bank increased by million related to highmortgage npls by million impacted by single loan that we enter npl status after becoming current in the second quarter npls in bppr increased by million mainly driven by a million increase in oreo partially offset by a million reduction in mortgage and a million reduction in commercial oreos in bppr decreased by million driven by sales of residential real estate properties interest of npls decreased by million in bppr the decrease was driven by mortgage in popular bank the million reduction in commercial was offset in part by the million mortgage loan that we enter npl status it is important to note that this residential property is welllocated has a loantovalue below and that we have no additional lending exposure to this client the ratio of npls to total loans held in portfolio remained flat at turning to slide number net chargeoffs amounted to million or a annualized basis points of average loans held in portfolio compared to million or basis points in the prior quarter net chargeoff in bppr increased by million driven by higher consumer by million offset in part by lower commercial and construction by million in popular bank net chargeoff remained flat quarteroverquarter given the credit performance in the first three quarters of the year and our outlook for the fourth quarter we expect net chargeoff for the full year at the low end of our initial guidance of basis points to basis points please turn to slide number the allowance for credit losses increased by million to million in bppr the acl increased by million mainly due to a combination of growth in the commercial portfolios and changes in credit quality trends in the auto and credit cards portfolio in popular bank the acl decreased by million mainly driven by lower reserves in the commercial and construction portfolios due to improvements in risk ratings the corporation ratio of acl to loans held in portfolio was versus in the prior quarter the ratio of the acl to npls was compared to in the previous quarter the provision for credit losses was million compared to million in the prior quarter reflecting higher balances higher losses and changes in credit quality in bppr the provision was million compared to million while in popular bank the provision was a benefit of million similar to the prior quarter to summarize credit quality metrics remained stable during the third quarter we are attentive to the evolving environment but remain encouraged by the performance of our loan book with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks thank you popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 ignacio alvarez chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and jorge for your updates while the increase in revenues was lower than we anticipated the underlying drivers of our business continue to be favorable as demonstrated by the progression of net interest income and margin loan growth and stable credit trends we are making headway in our business transformation with meaningful progress in modernizing our customer channels and improving the customer experience we have streamlined the process of rolling out updates to our various customerfacing applications for example our consumer digital banking application in puerto rico has improved the time to production of releases by over the past two years additionally we are increasing the personalization of our offering to provide customers the right solution at the right time and to the right channel to deepen our relationships with them i am optimistic about our prospects for the remainder of the year and beyond business trends in puerto rico continue to be positive and we are well positioned to participate in the economic activity that is expected to be generated in the coming years we are now ready to answer your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from brett rabatin with hovde group your line is open please go ahead brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey guys good morning wanted to start with the deposit trends on the retail side that you discussed in your prepared commentary was there just a maybe not an all of a sudden move but was there just a concerted move this quarter with maybe some activity can you talk a little bit more about what happened with how high networth retail and clients were moving deposits etcetera and just trying to get a sense of where you think that might go from here jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc sure brett so when we look back last seven or eight quarters what we have seen is a pretty consistent trend focused on our high net worth and corporate clients looking for yield enhancement weve seen a lot of movement into our popular security subsidiary its pretty normal this is consistent with what we have seen in the us as restrictive monetary policy people will move what was new during this quarter and we have said ph city money wakes up we did see a little bit of an acceleration of more money moving out and into those higher yielding assets but what surprised us was the level of expenditure across our retail network as i mentioned in my prepared remarks the from the period of march through june our retail clients received roughly billion in refunds from their tax refunds in puerto rico that was about million more than last year traditionally that money stays longer and it circulates within our client base and structure we did not see that theres nothing to pinpoint i think there when we look at the market theres nothing to pinpoint of deposit moving within the banking system its really moving out expenditures we have seen an increase in our debit card purchases increases in the payment levels on credit cards its just the aggregate impact of everything popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 as we look through as i mentioned we have our average balance are about higher than prepandemic levels we certainly would not expect at this stage people to go back to those levels obviously a passage of time people are making more money in puerto rico et cetera but weve tried to kind of size what do we think is at risk its very hard when youre talking about the broadbased retail network talking were million clients youre talking about peoples psychology what theyre doing these are a little bit unprecedented times in terms of the amount of stimulus that puerto ricans have received through the pandemic and beyond but we do believe our best estimate right now is that maybe there is still risk of somewhere in the million to million in our deposit base but in terms of timing or ability we are not sure but we are very focused on this the one other thing i would say i mean obviously the nii we talked about nii being a catalyst of our growth both in terms of achieving our goals for this year and for next year that hasnt changed i mean in terms of the dynamic the repricing of the investment portfolio continues loan origination and the repricing of our portfolio also continues when we look at were not ready to give you guidance for we will do that in more detail in january on our call but i think at this stage we would expect that at least in we would see that same level of growth of or so that we are seeing this year in but well give you more information in january when we are have a little more visibility and we see how the fourth quarter trends and our clients behave brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay thats really helpful and then wanted to dive a little further into the expense growth guidance specifically for the fourth quarter with the full year at billion which would intimate about million of growth in the fourth quarter can you guys maybe talk about that is there some consulting going on into the end of the year and i know youre probably not ready to give guidance for but any early thoughts on how the fourth quarter levels might matriculate into next year jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah yeah brett we need to make sure that when we give the guidance of the billion its on a gaap basis so i just want to make sure that youre looking at brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah theres some fdicrelated costs and i think we had some the late penalties on the taxes in the first quarter i think those two are they combine to maybe like million million so i think brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc yeah okay popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc the target probably that youre looking at brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc lower jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc is probably closer to million to million range rather than the million that you mentioned its still an increase yes it is related in part to the efforts of transformation professional fees consultingrelated expenses as well as seasonal expenses that occur every year towards the end of the year local holiday spending promotions donations and different things that if you look at our historical the fourth quarter always tends to have an uptick in expenses of course were conscious of controlling costs particularly given the nii mix this quarter and well do our best to control that as far as next year well provide you that guidance in january brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay if i can just followup on that is how much of the fourth quarter increase might be repeatable with now that you could think about ie the yearend bonuses and christmas jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah well give you a guidance in january brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay fair enough jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc well do the same thing ph about the guidance but if you can look back you see some seasonality in our expenses brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay fair enough appreciate all the color guys jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc okay operator we now turn to frank schiraldi with piper sandler your line is open please go ahead popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning just wondering if you can jorge maybe talk a little bit about the ability to reprice deposits here what youre seeing so far given the 50basispoint cut in september id imagine maybe just given some of the numbers you talk about its potentially being at risk on the deposit side maybe makes it a little bit more difficult to reduce costs just why dont you give us an update on thoughts of deposit betas really here i guess in the near term jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc sure so we like to think of that in different buckets lets first talk about the public deposits in puerto rico those as you know our market linked to shortterm indexes we dont disclose the indexes but theyre shortterm indexes and its not tied to fed funds were already seeing the benefits of that those are priced with a lag but some of the short term index are maybe moving ahead of projected or expected movement by the fed so were already seeing the benefit of that in the fourth quarter on the public deposits and we would expect that to continue the second group is the retail and commercial network in puerto rico as you know weve had very low betas on the way up in puerto rico we dont expect to see a lot of opportunities to move down particularly in the early stages of movements so that we dont we would expect that to have very low betas on the way down and then you have the us deposits there both the direct online channel as well as the branch network we have had high betas in both of those channels we would expect and we have already begun to see reductions in both of those deposit sources but those are a little bit more subject to market competitive dynamics for example i think in the online channel we were able to bring down our savings accounts i think basis points versus the fed move basis points we have seen competitors in the space actually increase rates in the last couple of weeks so right now were pricing to maintain deposits were not pricing to grow there is opportunity there and well be very focused thats an area of opportunity for us but given the competitive stand of the us franchise any changes in liquidity in the marketplace or pricing by bigger banks or competitors could have an impact but over time there is an opportunity there frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just in terms of the updated the rotce i think you mentioned youre targeting now by the fourth quarter or in the fourth quarter does that continue to not benefit from an aoci loss that continue to exclude aoci that rotce target jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc that is correct that is the same calculation frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 okay and any thoughts on in terms of as you obviously the nii reduction in nii expectations set you back a little bit in terms of getting to a higher return on tangible common equity but any sort of updated thought on that bogey in terms of timing or too early to say jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc its early to say i mean i would say that number one as a management team were still focused on that the dynamics of popular havent changed in just one quarter we still believe that the transformation efforts and managements focus towards a determined target albeit aspirational is still there and important for us i think it will take us longer were going to have to work a lot harder to get there but we are focused on that in terms of the rotce i think the simplest way i can describe it i look at the second quarter results and the third quarter results we took a step back in those rotces were coming from a lower base we want to get back to that growth and that level that we had anticipated before and work hard towards achieving that frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co and if i could just sneak in one last one just on in the past i think you guys have done sort of the accelerated buyback route and so kind of harder to get a sense but could you is there any would you say theres any seasonality to buyback activity here just trying to get a sense of what the quarterly run rate could look like going forward jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc so one thing ill make sure listeners know we started the third quarters buyback in august we really were in the market for two months out of the quarter we hope that over time youll get to see a cadence of our activity we obviously havent given a timeframe on that authorization but we intend to use it but maintain the flexibility like our peers we see peers change in terms of when theyre in and out of the market we just want to maintain that flexibility but at the end we didnt put an authorization just as a benchmark for you but for us to execute upon that nii growth will still continue to be the driver to improve rotce but as obviously now that we have an authorization it should contribute to improving that return from where were at today frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay all right great thank you operator our next question comes from kelly motta with kbw your line is open please go ahead jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc hi kelly kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 hey good morning thanks for the question maybe just a housekeeping item on expenses i appreciate that youre guiding on a gaap basis just want to clarify does that include any oreo gains and losses in there jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc sure yeah thats part of our expense base kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and loan growth was really really strong this quarter kind of as you look ahead im interested in i appreciate for the year as you look ahead wondering where youre seeing good opportunities how youre seeing demand on the island for loans and if you expect an acceleration in that with the rates coming down ignacio alvarez a chief executive officer director popular inc this is ignacio i mean really the demand in puerto rico as you said has been very strong and weve been able to close a number of loans i dont know if i would use the word accelerate but i think its going to continue to be strong we the pipeline looks good some of the loans are bulky so it depends when we close them and what payoffs we have but were seeing good demand across the board especially in commercial were seeing a lot of interest in investment in puerto rico as we continue to trade were seeing people coming to the island so were very confident i mean almost across all sectors are we seeing strong loan growth especially in the commercial area jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc and one thing i would add kelly is i mean thats puerto rico in the us this year weve had no we went backwards right in the first two quarters we went down this quarter we grew about million we are seeing a pickup in demand credit demand in the us in particularly in construction and in community association lending in florida in particular i think thats an area where we might be able to see more acceleration certainly from the level this year part of that slow loan growth its whats affected our projection for next year and the change in the rotce guidance ignacio alvarez a chief executive officer director popular inc i mean the things in puerto rico continue to really steady growth i mean numbers just came out for unemployment in september and the unemployment rate went down again from to and we added private sector jobs of in the month so that gives you sort of a benchmark of economic activity on the island kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats helpful maybe last one for me i think in your prepared remarks liquidity on the island remains high you did have now two quarters of ph nibs outflows im wondering is there any way that youre approaching the deposit base in terms of ph nibs that could continue to be at risk and how does that factor into your revised kind of nii profitability outlook from here popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah so what i mentioned before is that looking at the average balances being around higher than pre pandemic and seeing the behavior that we saw in this last quarter in particular with our retail clients hard to predict we think that our best guess right now its you still have million to million at possibly at risk from that base and i dont in terms of timeline or anything we dont have that and we certainly would expect that in the second quarter next year well see the same cyclicality of tax refunds coming in at the same level theres no reason to expect that they will be significantly different or lower its just whether the client behavior changes were not seeing people certainly the affluent and corporate clients commercial clients have been consistent over the last seven or eight quarters in improving and enhancing their excess liquidity using it for working capital or simply going for higher yield were not seeing necessarily a lot of clients in the mass affluent group moving to other banks or be competitive in terms of yield and cost so its really a matter of balancing client behavior with our offerings of deposit service and being strategic with our larger relationships to make sure that we retain those deposits kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats helpful ill step back thank you operator we now turn to jared shaw with barclays your line is open please go ahead jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hi thanks good morning jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc morning jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc i guess maybe just first on the new rotce target what capital level are you assuming to support that or you should are you expecting to see capital be significantly lower or potentially lower or is it still grinding higher with that base jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah jared i mean i think the nii continues to be the driver of increased profitability that doesnt change with the change in the target i would again we have a the authorization is out were executing upon that we know that thats a lever certainly but we want to make sure that what were doing is sustainable and nii will continue to be the big driver we havent given that target number well have to think about it and see if it helps in the future but nii continues to be the driver popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay okay and then just shifting to credit you look at chargeoff levels theyve been better than that longer term normalized range call it basis points to basis points is this a new good longterm level or is there a reason to think we should be we should expect to see credit costs and chargeoffs migrate back up higher lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc yeah i will say certainly that in the short term that will not be the case i mean we still see strong performance by our commercial and mortgage portfolios with actually in the mortgage portfolio were seeing negative chargeoffs or benefits so i mean i think in the short to medium term probably not in the long term well see jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks operator we now turn to timur braziler with wells fargo your line is open please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning just going back to the nii guidance tax equivalent nii declined in the guide for fourth quarter is that on a tax equivalent basis or is there going to be continued movement between the adjustment in tax equivalent and the tax rate there that might change the tax equivalent expectation versus the gaap nii expectations jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc no the guidance is gaap is based on gaap but one of the drivers obviously we had lower taxexempt income because of the lower earning assets timur but with the increase in the deposit costs in puerto rico that just essentially makes your taxexempt portfolio less efficient thats why you had kind of this weird relationship between an expansion in the gaap in the nim gaap versus the taxaffected gaap timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i mean could we extrapolate that same level of increase in the tax equivalent nii for next quarter or not jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc i dont think of it that way so ill be giving an answer without really having looked at it what i would say is that we are anticipating the nim to expand i would expect that both the gaap nim and the taxeffective taxaffected nim to expand as well timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 okay thanks for that and then just again on the deposits any line of sight for public fund outflows in i guess the decline that happened in was there anything that maybe got pulled forward and i guess to what extent do you need a stable deposit base in the fourth quarter in order to achieve that fourth quarter nii guide jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc well let me first say we dont have a large our guidance right now for the end of the year we gave billion to billion were not anticipating anything large in the fourth quarter we had anticipated the  payoff that was part of our we had visibility in that and why we had not increased the range in when we announced in the second quarter in the first quarter the government does have some go payments and other disbursements that may impact the first quarter but right now were not expecting anything large timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just last for me trying to extrapolate consumer credit trends with the fact that consumers are starting to utilize more their liquidity how closely correlated are those two weve seen kind of consumer trough earlier in the year now starting to take a little higher in those delinquencies as some of that liquidity is being rolled off can you maybe provide us an update on where you see consumer credit peaking out here lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc well i mean the way we look at the consumer outlook for it i mean we have a very strong market a very strong unemployment market with as ignacio mentioned unemployment a record low we also have a consumers still have a lot of liquidity above the liquidity that they have prior to the pandemic so we are generally positive about the outlook for the consumer on a goingforward basis and also with rates coming down i think that is also going to also be helpful for some of the outstanding debt that they may have particularly in credit cards timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for the question operator our next question comes from ben gerlinger with citi your line is open please go ahead benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good morning jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc hi good morning ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 i just wanted to clarify in the prepared remarks you said if i caught it correctly of at least or should we kind of earmark it for i know its a bit of a modeling and backing into it im just trying to make sure that were not expecting too low of expectations here jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc i did say at least benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc at least okay jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc its the target benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got it okay the cushion the blow a little bit here but when you think about credit i know we just touched on it here with the last question but i know in you made initiatives kind of calling people within the consumer book a little bit faster doing things behind the scenes thats clearly showed improvement on you seem to show a little slippage and its not like you guys are the only one the other banks in puerto rico seem to have a similar component but when you go forward here is there any color you can provide on kind of marrying the two of like you just said unemployment is lower wages are up were still seeing a little bit of slippage is it legacy fico kind of working its way through the pipeline here or just any thoughts on credit jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc i think i mean i think you did touch upon some of the things we did see that deterioration in the second half of last year and we reacted by changing underwriting collection efforts et cetera some of that as you said its the indiscernible on it it will take some time to get through and clear up its important that the us is also seeing strong unemployment numbers strong consumer and they are seeing consumer losses as well so its not unique to us were still well below prepandemic levels in some of our portfolios particularly around delinquencies i think where you see some of the noise in puerto rico we do have some purchased portfolios that we bought from fintechs in and those have higher losses than the puerto rico numbers so that skews the number a little bit if you want to get a sense you can look at the losses in the consumer loan portfolio npv and those losses are very similar and you can kind of get a sense i think theres about million in that portfolio so that impacts those number and then the other is the auto loans they do tend to be a little bit more lumpy because you do have to do the recovery of those delinquent autos and repossess them and that can be lumpy in the numbers for chargeoffs i dont know lidio popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc two things maybe to add to that i would say first when were looking at things on a vintage basis we see very strong performance by the recent vintages so that is very encouraging from a goingforward basis we also see the trends in early delinquency also very positive so notwithstanding the current performance we think as we look into the future things are heading in the right direction benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you and i know youre not going to give guidance on expenses yet and i also do know that youre also doing behindthescene initiatives is any of that rolling off in jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc no i mean i think the transformation effort will be ongoing as weve said we look at early on a slowdown in expense increases not necessarily a recovery or reduction of expenses but what we see its a lot of shifts right so maybe today were spending money in consultant and doing work while were capitalizing software development next year you might see reductions in consultants and then you pick up on depreciation amortization of software capitalized software so its a trend that kind of bounces out but the transformation effort is going to take some time it doesnt end in benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got it okay i got you so not coming down but the pace of increase probably slows okay jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc right benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc helpful and i appreciate thank you operator we now turn to gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning gentlemen jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc hi good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 jorge can you share with us i think when i looked at your 10q you guys in your asset sensitivity table indicated that you were assetsensitive that a rise in rates would positively affect net interest income and i noticed this quarter the investment portfolio duration extended out a little bit from the second quarter are you currently assetsensitive still today and then the second part of the question is and im not asking for guidance but if the forward interest rate curve is correct and we see the short end of the curve coming down possibly the by the end of next year would that be an added headwind for net interest income growth for you guys jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc so first gerard i want to say i mean we are fairly neutral in our interest rate position right we measure that on a 12month period so i want to make sure that we highlight that in terms of the quarter we did start during this quarter we bought about billion in two to threeyear treasury notes both in puerto rico and in the us bank to try to mitigate any or hedge against rates coming down so were trying to become a little bit more liabilitysensitive we expect to continue that not necessarily adding more to it but as new notes mature reinvesting them in that two to threeyear period trying to maintain similar level of duration for the entire portfolio and over time that will help mitigate certainly we all would like to see a normal sloping curve that was very helpful to us and a higherforlonger environment with the loan growth that were seeing in puerto rico and certainly helps if you eventually get to reduce your funding costs but given our position and the repricing of those that investment portfolio that today is underwater against the cost of public funds we see that we still have a lot of tailwinds positive tailwinds through the next few quarters i think through for repricing and getting a lift from where were at today to where those should reprice gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and then just to follow up on the credit conversation weve been having on this call the credit card portfolio slide you give us very good detail on whats going on with delinquencies and chargeoffs im curious it seems odd that when i look at your fico mix of originations they steadily have increased from the precovid period to where we are today but you point out in this slide that your delinquency levels as well as your chargeoffs as a percentage of the portfolio have risen above precovid levels whats accounting for the disconnect of a higher fico score but now youre seeing higher chargeoff and delinquency levels lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc in regards of credit cards originations dont necessarily equate with outstanding balances because it takes time so it takes a little bit of time for it to build up so the ph originations that you see in the slide might coincide with a very small percentage of our total balance so that explains why notwithstanding the fact that youve seen significant improvement in fico you dont you are not seeing the same level of improvement in delinquency and chargeoffs gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 i see and would that yeah do you have a sense of the outstandings not the originations but where the fico scores sit for the outstandings as of the third quarter lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc we have that information that is not something that we have publicly made available well think about it and maybe provide that in a future meeting gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc gerard i would also add i mean certainly when we look at prepandemic i mean the current rate environment is fairly high right so i think those have some impact too and hopefully this is one portfolio that as rates start coming down the borrowers should see some very quick relief in terms of the level of payments et cetera gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc correct okay thank you operator operator instructions we now turn to samuel varga with ubs your line is open please go ahead samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc good morning i just wanted to go back to the public deposits for a minute given some of the shortterm rate moves for example like the oneyear treasury over the last few weeks is there argument to be made that theres going to be some headwind to repricing them down in jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc theres i mean theres always basis risk internally when we talk about being neutral we talk about being neutral over a 12month period but bottom line that means that our assets i mean we have still a number of assets and liabilities that we price right there is a difference in basis so theres always that risk the risk is not always negative right the rates can get ahead of fed movements and benefit and we have assets that may be repricing based on prime versus liabilities pricing based on different indexes so that could create some noise so im always hesitant to say that its a headwind there is a timing difference i mean these are our price on a lag so that you always have that risk the full effect will take longer but weve also tried to stagger some of our tbills to account for some of these things and when we try to manage to that i think the issue and the hesitation is that it is a billion billion portfolio so basis points basis points does make a difference there samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2024 yes yes thank you for that and then just wanted to go back to you talked through the different deposit channels and through the repricing opportunities it sounds like youre happy to pay the rates to keep the deposits sort of the nonpublic deposits at least flat is that the right way to read it or could we see you get sort of aggressive enough to drive some deposit growth in the nonpublic part of the base ignacio alvarez a chief executive officer director popular inc this is ignacio i think we only get aggressive if we thought we were losing deposits to price competition and i dont think thats the case i mean there is some price competition from the us treasuries but we cant raise deposit rates enough to compete with that and in terms of regular deposits from our commercial like competitors were not seeing that so were just seeing people either moving money to these other alternative investments or spending the money so we dont think at this point it would be productive to raise rates now well be like jorge mentioned earlier in the call we dont think were going to be able to lower rates much either because theyre starting from a low point samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for taking my question operator this concludes our qa ill now hand back to ignacio alvarez ceo for any final remarks ignacio alvarez chief executive officer director popular inc thanks again for joining us today and for your questions we look forward to updating you on our fourth quarter results in january have a nice day operator ladies and gentlemen
