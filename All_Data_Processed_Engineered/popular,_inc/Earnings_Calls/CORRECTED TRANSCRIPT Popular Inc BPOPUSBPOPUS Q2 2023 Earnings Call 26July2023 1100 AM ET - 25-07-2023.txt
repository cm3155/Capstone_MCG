morning and thank you for joining the call the second quarter was another strong one in which we achieved net income of million million lower than the first quarter results of million net interest income and noninterest income remained strong the decrease in net income was driven by higher operating expenses offset in part by a lower provision for credit losses we grew loan balances by million during the quarter banco popular generated loan growth across all segments while popular bank achieved growth in commercial and construction loans offset in part by runoff in the mortgage and consumer portfolios yeartodate loan balances have grown by more than approximately million our net interest margin decreased by basis points to in the quarter primarily as a result of a basis point increase in deposit costs this was partially offset by higher loan balances and the repricing of adjustable rate loans in a higher interest rate environment as well as higher balance of money market investments driven by our strong deposit growth noninterest income continue to improve excluding the million insurance claim reimbursement recorded in the first quarter fee income was million higher revenues related to customer transaction activity were particularly strong and we also began to see some early results from our various transformation initiatives operating expenses increased by million as we continue to strategically invest in our people in areas such as regulatory compliance and technology and projects related to our transformation credit quality trends remain positive npls once again decreased in the period and net chargeoffs remain well below prepandemic levels we maintained robust liquidity anchored by our deposit franchise and our high levels of cash reserves and unpledged

channels among our retail customers remained strong active users on our mi banco platform exceeded million or of our customer base in addition we continue to capture more than of our deposits through digital channels this trend remains significantly higher than prepandemic levels demonstrating our customers adoption of this technology in the second quarter consumer spending remained healthy with combined credit and debit card sales up compared to the second quarter of our auto and lease originations increased by compared to the first quarter as demand for cars has continued to be strong in puerto rico mortgage production in puerto rico appears to have stabilized in the second quarter the dollar value of mortgage originations at banco popular increased by compared to the second quarter of last year driven primarily by home purchase activity the puerto rico economy performed well during the second quarter business activity is solid and remains in good shape as reflected in the continued positive trends in total employment and other economic data popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 the tourism and hospitality sector continue to be a source of strength for the local economy yeartodate san juan airport has seen record levels of passenger traffic hotel demand has also been very strong yeartodate occupancy average daily rates and revpar are all at the highest level seen in nearly a decade there are still approximately billion of hurricane disaster recovery funds yet to be disbursed we expect that these funds will support economic activity in many sectors in the coming years in fact we are beginning to see these funds being disbursed into local construction projects as this infrastructure investment in the economy expands we are well positioned to serve the needs of our customers and benefit from such activity in short we are pleased with our results for the quarter particularly our strong loan growth in both puerto rico and in the us as well as the continued strength of our deposit base liquidity and credit quality were encouraged by the resiliency of the us economy and strong economic activity in puerto rico we remain optimistic about the future of puerto rico our primary market and our ability to manage and serve the needs of our growing customer base i now turn the call over to carlos for more details on our financial results carlos j vázquez chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc thank you ignacio please turn to slide we reported net income of million compared to million in  net interest income was million in line with  on a taxable equivalent basis net interest income was million down million from  due to a higher disallowed interest expense in the calculation of taxes in puerto rico noninterest income was million a million decrease from  which included a million insurance claim reimbursement excluding the  reimbursement during the quarter noninterest income increased by million driven by customer activity service charges on deposit accounts increased by million mainly due to higher cash management fees on commercial customer accounts additionally other service fees increased by million primarily driven by higher credit and debit card fees due to higher volume of customer transactions going forward we expect noninterest income to be approximately million to million per quarter the increase from our prior million quarterly guidance is partly due to two transformationrelated initiatives that have yielded early results first we have enhanced the pricing segmentation in our commercial cash management business in puerto rico and second last year we introduced a commercial credit card product for puerto rico sme businesses both initiatives have contributed additional fee income the provision on our credit losses was million compared to million in the first quarter total operating expenses were million sic million in  an increase of million from the prior quarter this increase was primarily driven by higher professional fees by million related to regulatory compliance and cyber security initiatives as well as technology and software expenses that increased by million during  we incurred million of transformationrelated expenses compared to million last quarter we continue to anticipate transformationrelated expenses of approximately million in as these efforts are expected to accelerate in the second half of the year other large expense variances were higher business promotion expense by million mostly related to credit card customer loyalty programs higher processing and transactional services expenses by million due to retail credit and debit card replacement costs and finally lower personnel costs by million primarily related to lower equitybased compensation expenses personnel costs historically exhibited a seasonal decrease in the second popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 quarter then typically increase for the remainder of the year in part due to the impact of annual merit increases which are effective on july our quarterly expense trajectory has historically ramped up as the year progresses we anticipate that will be consistent with our experience and continue to expect expenses for the year of approximately billion we will strive to come in below this expected level of expenses our effective tax rate for the quarter was for the full year we now expect an effective tax rate to be between and this range is somewhat tighter than the to range provided during our last webcast please turn to slide net interest income was million on a taxable equivalent basis it was million million lower than in the first quarter net interest margin decreased by basis points to in  on a taxable equivalent basis nim was a decrease of basis points versus  the decrease is driven by higher interest expense on deposits due to the increase in balance of cost of public sector deposits as well as growth in high cost deposit accounts at popular bank this was partially offset by higher loan yields and balances across all major lending categories at the end of the second quarter public sector deposits were roughly billion an increase of billion compared to  the increase in  was consistent with historical trends and as such by the end of we still expect deposits public deposits to be in the range of billion to billion it is important to reiterate that by law in puerto rico public deposits must be collateralized while changes in the level of these deposits may impact profitability they do not have a significant impact on our liquidity excluding puerto rico public deposits customer deposit balances were essentially unchanged in the quarter we did however see some mix shift as noninterestbearing deposits decreased by million in the quarter this was offset by increases in time and saving deposits of popular bank gathered through a direct online channel in  we continue to see commercial and high net worth clients pursuing better yields on excess liquidity by moving these funds outside the banking sector however we have been able to capture a good portion of these in our broker dealer which saw inflows from deposit customers of approximately million in  our ending loan balances increased by million compared to  driven by growth in all loan segments at bppr and by commercial and construction loans at pb this growth is net of a transfer to held for sale of a million private label credit card portfolio that portfolio was sold at par value in early  we are encouraged by the demand for credit at bppr and pb we will continue to take advantage of ph prudent opportunities to extend credit and improve the use and yield of our existing liquidity our interest rate sensitivity continues to be relatively neutral as this year progresses we expect the margin to resume an upward trajectory the timing will depend on our loan and deposit growth and mix investment portfolio strategy and the pace of repricing of public and incrementally retail and commercial deposits deposit betas in the current indiscernible cycle are now above the prior cycle we have seen a total cumulative deposit beta of to date in this cycle in bppr total deposit costs increased by basis points compared to an

basis points in  led by retail deposits gathered primarily through our online channel in puerto rico our combined retail and commercial deposit betas cycle todate continue to be less than given the increase in shortterm interest rate we expect a continued increase in the cost of public sector deposits the deposit pricing agreement with the puerto rico public sector is market linked with a lag this source of funding results in an attractive spread under market rates in the second quarter the cost of public sector deposits increased by basis points compared to our april estimate of basis points indiscernible popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 and the mechanics of the interest expense calculation we expect the cost of public deposits to increase by approximately basis points in  please turn to slide our investment portfolio is almost entirely comprised of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities which carry minimal credit risk including our cash position this portfolio has an average duration of approximately years as of the end of the second quarter the balance of the unrealized loss in our htm portfolio stood at million a reduction of million from  we expect this loss will be amortized back into capital throughout the remaining life of that portfolio at a rate of approximately per quarter through please turn to slide our return on tangible equity was in the quarter regulatory capital levels remain strong our common equity tier ratio in  of increased by basis points from  tangible book value per share at quarter end was an increase of per share given the continued uncertainty on the outlook for rates the economy and the potential regulatory response to invest in the banking sector we do not expect to engage in a share repurchase during the remainder of we do plan however to consider a dividend increase later this year well review future capital actions as market conditions evolve our longterm outlook on capital return has not changed and of course on our strong regulatory capital ratios over time we expect our regulatory capital ratios to gravitate towards the level of our mainland peers plus the spread with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano chief risk officer executive vice presidentcorporate risk management group popular inc thank you carlos and good morning overall popular continue to exhibit strong credit quality trends with low levels of net chargeoffs and decreasing nonperforming loans we believe that the improvements over the last few years in the risk profile of the corporations loans portfolio positions popular to operate successfully in the current environment however we continue to closely monitor changes in borrower performance and the macroeconomic environment even inflationary pressures and geopolitical risks before discussing the credit metrics for the quarter i would like to address the risk profile of three loan segments office cre credit cards and auto and lease financing portfolio we have also included additional information for these segments in the appendix to todays presentations the office segment is receiving a lot of attention in the current environment due to the shift to remote work and higher interest rates popular consolidated office area exposure is limited representing only or million of our total loan portfolio and is mainly comprised of low to midrise properties located in suburban areas and is welldiversified across tenant type with an average loan size of million we have no exposure to large office tenant cre in the mainland urban city centers the portfolio has a favorable credit risk profile with low levels of npls and classified loans in terms of our credit card and auto and lease portfolios the credit risk profile of these portfolios is anchored on the strength of the job market and economic activities in puerto rico coupled with the credit quality of our originations over the last few years in terms of credit cards 30plus delinquency is at compared to an average of in the pre pandemic period and yeartodate net chargeoffs are at compared to an average of in the pre pandemic period in terms

the quarter which over time will drive more customer connectivity operational efficiencies and greater potential for profitable growth and sustained return on capital in june we released our annual corporate sustainability report we continue to focus on providing opportunity for progress protecting the environment and promoting leadership we are mindful of the responsibility we have to puerto rico as the leading banking institution and to all the communities that we proudly serve we are now ready to answer your questions popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from timur braziler from wells fargo timur your line is now open please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning maybe ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc starting on the loan growth thats remained quite strong now for many consecutive quarters im just wondering as you look ahead is this kind of where were at for the foreseeable future or just given the remaining idiosyncratic tailwinds for the island does loan growth actually accelerate as some of these construction projects you referenced come online ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well timur this is ignacio indiscernible its always hard to project and forecast loan growth in puerto rico its coming and its very lumpy especially the larger loans that drive some of the growth but what i can say is that we continue to have good pipelines good demand from our customers were not seeing that decrease so again i dont want to put a percentage level on it but we have strong loan demand both in puerto rico and the us so i wouldnt put a number on it but we certainly dont see it decelerating at this point timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then as far as appetite for mainland credit the growth in construction im assuming thats contractual loans funding up and then just maybe speak more broadly about appetite and growing the mainland portfolio in the face of whats expected to be an uncertain credit environment in the back end of the year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah lidio could add more to that but i want to point out that weve always been a construction lender especially in the new york metro area but were not very involved in the office sector so were mostly most of our construction is around multifamily so i think well continue to be prudent and lending to existing clients but i dont see us pulling back from our traditional markets that we serve again were not in the office sector i dont know lidio if you want to add anything indiscernible lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice presidentcorporate risk management group popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 i think thats perfect timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe switching to the funding of this loan growth so given the seasonal trends and public funds and those coming down in the back end of the year coupled with the loan to deposit ratio that still has plenty of room to move higher is there a wantingness to fund the upcoming loan growth through incremental deposits or are you okay borrowing at this level and funding the new growth carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc hi timur carlos so at this point in time we do have a very strong liquidity position so everything else being equal our ph first quarter call would be our cash to fund our loan growth we are very lucky that the yields on our loan book are quite attractive so theyre even more attractive than the yields we can achieve and still on our investment portfolio so that would be first call at this point in time i dont envision us having significant borrowings to fund loan growth timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful and then last for me just on the expenses any color you can provide on the profit sharing component pretty big quarter relative to street expectations and i know street is kind of the proxy that you have used in the past for determining whether or not were going to have profit sharing contribution but your comments on hoping to come in better than that ph im just wondering what the outlook is for profit sharing in relation to that comment carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc at this point in time there is no consideration of profit sharing in our numbers timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it thank you ill step back operator thank you our next question comes from brody preston from ubs brody your line is now open please proceed with your question brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone i want to just ask on the fte adjustment i guess i was a little bit perplexed this quarter the fte adjustment keeps moving a bit lower but the tax rate was kind of flattish and it looked like you kind of narrowed the guidance range a little bit i guess can you maybe explain again the dynamics between whats happening with the fte adjustment and the tax rate at this point jorge j garcía a senior vice president corporate comptroller popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 hi this is jorge garcía good morning it is a complicated question i dont blame you the first thing i will say is that the disallowance of our interest expense which is really what drives that fte adjustment is increasing giving that the cost of deposits are increasing so thats the first impact that youre seeing essentially your tax free income is becoming less your other question is why arent we seeing a change necessarily in our effective tax rate and that has to do with gaap accounting where you try to anticipate changes in that effective tax rate throughout the year and you make adjustments for that on a quarterbyquarter basis so you normalize it brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay maybe just shifting to deposit costs i think you provided the betas the cumulative betas for the interest bearing portions cycle to date for the retail commercial and public deposits i know the public is going to be with the lag but just on the commercial and retail side just wanted to get your thoughts if you have any on where you thought those betas would end the year by the fourth quarter of this year carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc yeah well it depends in part on what the fed does today and what the fed does the rest of the year frankly i think the trends are trends that can be expected to continue meaning that our betas in puerto rico will continue to be lower in our retail and commercial businesses commercial slightly higher retail a lot lower then indiscernible market betas and then well have a beta thats slightly higher or closer to market averages in our bank in the us so i think those trends will probably continue to the extent that the fed has done this afternoon well then that will affect how it looks for the rest of the year brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then just last one for me for right now is just on the securities book im sorry if you already touched on it and i missed it just want to get your thoughts on how thats going to ebb and flow and uses of securities cash flows at this point for the remainder of the year you had negative growth the first three quarters of this year just wondering if were going to continue to use that as a source of liquidity going forward carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc yeah weve been cautious with and actually have been building cash because of the uncertainty in the last couple of quarters brody i think well feel a lot better then a lot of that is behind us now so what you should see starting this quarter is that well start to redeploy some of the cash well probably end up with lower cash balances hopefully because we have a lot of loans first but even without that well start to redeploy some of that cash it may not change the profile of the investment portfolio is too much because some of that redeployment will probably be in tbills where the yield is going to be similar and then the liquidity will be basically cash like but it will provide us a tax benefit brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thank you for that operator thank you our next question comes from alex twerdahl from piper sandler alex your line is now open please proceed with your question popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning all ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice presidentcorporate risk management group popular inc good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co thanks just keeping on that last question on the tax rate and on the tbills does the tax rate range that youve provided the to does that anticipate any additional investment into tbills as the year progresses carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc yeah that range incorporates our best guess of what were going to do with the balance sheet the rest of the year yes alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then i got to dig into just the comments on the buyback a little bit can you just sort of i know theres obviously a lot of uncertainty in the banking environment but is it specifically uncertain around new capital rules for ccar banks is it specifically around waiting to see how credit develops or kind of what are the trigger points and then maybe just remind us how the process works if you do go through and raise the dividend is it a similar process to your normal capital plans or is it different in any way from what you normally go through each year carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc okay let me kind of walk through some thoughts on capital to i think well try kind of address a lot of your questions alex i mean as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we expect to consider a dividend increase in probably late in the third quarter of this year and at this time we no buyback is planned for the rest of this year obviously the final decision on any dividend increase rests with our board of directors so theyll have the final call on that weve described sort of our thinking process in the past that as we look at capital action it depends on us getting were looking for three things to inform our actions number one clarity on the path of interest rates number two clarity on the path for the economy and lastly clarity in the path for regulation those are sort of the inputs that help us make decisions now it is still uncertain i mean were getting some information from the fed tomorrow on capital which would be a nice first step to start adding some clarity to the process by the way were getting information on capital popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 indiscernible anything on one liquidity framework that may change which is also pretty important as we think this through but well start getting some information from on that front at least hopefully tomorrow and then will start informing some of the uncertainty here so its unclear exactly when well get clarity in these matters but those are the inputs that were looking for additionally while its not a required regulatory ratio with tce and therefore aoci our consideration is in our decisionmaking process so that is the consideration what i can say today as far as the process which is the second part of your question is that presently we do not plan to return to our historical cadence of a yearly capital actions announcement in january instead while still not decided moving forward we will probably shift to a capital management process that is closer to what most other banks do where we will periodically announce stock repurchase authorization that may be executed from time to time so this is so what we can tell you so far and the process the we always advise the regulators on anything were doing with regards to capital and were no different this time and hopefully would get back to you later in the third quarter with a decision on the dividend alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thats good information and then just in terms of that process like suppose we got some clarity on rates as early as today and some clarity on regulation tomorrow and economy were never going to get clarity on but how long would it take you to actually go through that like the whole process with the fed is that something that is a pretty quick thing i remember when you guys did the evertec thing this seems like the approval happened basically almost overnight im just curious if thats evolved and gotten any easier over the years carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc yeah i mean the fed always has the option to decide everything on their timetable but the fact is that weve been working very effectively with our regulators over the last few years frankly youve seen it and what you mentioned on the approval on evertec is a reflection of it that we try to work closely with them we try to never surprise them they are always informed of what were trying to do and if they have to be involved we they have been very responsive in working with us if we have a timetable that were trying to meet so our relationship is very good and over the years theyve gotten better at understanding what were doing weve gotten better asking the right questions alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co got it and then one final question for me i wanted to just sort of dig into sort of conversation we havent talked about in probably a couple of conference calls about ma in the north american franchise and it just seems to me like were hearing anecdotally and seeing more announcements of loan sales some of them related to specific asset classes that you may or may not want to be into some of them related to rates but it seems like theres going to be potentially a bunch of loan sales coming up even some from the fdic theyre going to be potentially coming at pretty big discounts im curious you guys have tons of capital in north america if you have appetite to do some loan purchases and if so what the criteria might be ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah this is ignacio i think weve said it before we view ourselves as opportunistic buyers of assets so there is pools of assets that interests us we will definitely go there i think the assets that would interest us would be mostly those things that we are that we feel we have a certain level of expertise in so we have a certain level of popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 expertise in cre our healthcare financing the condominium association financing those are things that would be of interest to us so were not going to buy office portfolios at a discount that kind of thing even if its a very attractive were not going to do something thats not something that we have a particular level of expertise i dont think wed probably go after mortgage assets either so i think itd be more in the commercial area but if there are attractive assets in those areas that we feel we know well we would be interested to look at them sure alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks for taking my questions carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from kelly motta from kbw kelly your line is now open please go ahead kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thank you so much for the questions and good morning i thought i would just close the loop on the capital discussion i appreciate the commentary that youre reviewing the dividend now can you remind us what you guys can sort of target in terms of your dividend payout ratio and how we should be thinking about that as we review the dividends here carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc yeah there is i mean what we target is what we hear from regulators which seems to be something bordering around of income so thats what were trying to target a couple of recent announcements have taken banks slightly above that so were attentive to that we also dont know what their forecasts are so they may end up at depending on what they have there how theyre looking at the year but thats the broad guide is what we understand to be the regulatory preference that dividends be around that level ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah and this is ignacio we try to make the dividends do it a little bit every year so that we dont have a big rampup in one year so we try to do it incrementally and i think weve been very successful in the past in doing that kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood appreciate the color i did want to flip to the deposit base specifically the core deposit base excluding the government deposits it looks like there most of the growth came from the us can you kind of walk us through your strategy there and any deposit campaigns youre running and as we look ahead with excess liquidity in puerto rico still high but ph and really funding coming in but obviously where we are in the cycle just kind of outlook for how much higher liquidity balances or whatever you want to call it is left and what we should be thinking about the deposit outlook putting those dynamics together popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc yeah as i mentioned in the earlier question kelly i think its fair to assume that our cash balances will be coming down in the rest of the year from where they are today the biggest part of the deposit increase this quarter was still public sector deposits in puerto rico and then theres a good chunk at popular bank we continue to try to strengthen the deposit business of popular bank so that is a focus of the company the efforts actually the most obvious efforts are the increase in deposits through our online channel because that reacts quickly but theres another a bunch of other business efforts intended to actually improve the deposit business of popular bank as well the problem with those is that they are less visible because they move slower so that is not the only tool we have to improve the deposit business which is our goal we are moving different levers this lever happens to be the most obvious one obviously because its the one that moves the quickest ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah indiscernible kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc oh sorry kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc sorry indiscernible ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i was just saying in terms of puerto rico yeah in terms of puerto rico while deposits have gone down somewhat the average balances of our retail and small business clients especially are still way above pre pandemic levels so we dont i dont think we view the necessity of is starting to have aggressive marketing campaigns in puerto rico at this point given our deposit levels kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc appreciate the color that was my followup ill step back then thank you popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc thank you operator thank you our final question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc capital gerard your line is now open please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning ignacio lidio and carlos indiscernible gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc ignacio can you guys give us some color obviously puerto rico over the years has had a healthy manufacturing component to your economy i know in your prepared remarks that you talked about tourism and how well thats going in in stateside theres clear evidence of the onshoring of manufacturing coming back to ohio or indiana or et cetera are you guys seeing any evidence of the benefit of that possibly coming to puerto rico ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc the manufacturing sector based on the economic activity index is relatively healthy in puerto rico its been growing sometimes it goes up for a few quarters then it goes down a bit but frankly its been mostly in our traditional sectors the medical device sector which has been very strong in puerto rico also the aerodynamic area the technology relating to airplanes and motors and that kind of thing is very popular in the west coast i havent seen to date many brand new at the beginning of the last year we saw a couple of foreign firms come in an indian company i believe a mexican company so weve seen some foreign firms that dont have perhaps any presence in the us using puerto rico as their initial point especially in the pharmaceutical the generic pharmaceutical side but to be honest i havent seen a big impact from the onshoring yet we had a big promise for that but its been mostly the dynamism has been in the and there are traditional sectors that have been growing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup i believe the prepa bankruptcy schedule was suspended in june do you guys have any updates on whats going on there with the bankruptcy of prepa and the resolution that is ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc not really we dont know really more than we read in the press i mean were optimistic that the most recent proposal will get approved obviously it means theyre cutting the debt down more and the rates will obviously have to go up less than on the prior plan so were optimistic that we can get this behind us but really we dont have a lot of inside indiscernible on whats going on there behind the scenes popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and i apologize if you addressed this i came late onto the call but did you guys carlos give us the burn down rate for the next couple of years of the bond portfolio what percentage of it will pay off by now in the end of jorge j garcía a senior vice president corporate comptroller popular inc yeah i mean its on page of the deck gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah jorge j garcía a senior vice president corporate comptroller popular inc so that indiscernible yeah so i mean its some pretty aggressive rolldown in the treasury portfolio for the next two years mbses theyll be kind of present there theyre playing very slowly so thats something that as carlos mentioned if you have a rate reversal and prepayments they start to pick up again you could see some acceleration there but were not necessarily forecasting that they have about billion so thats an afs in treasuries that has an average life of around a year and a half so thatll kind of give you an idea of how that rolls in as carlos mentioned just complementing that wed probably be at least for now reinvesting some of those proceeds with tbills treasury curves inverted so actually picking up yields a bit doing that and maintaining a relatively shorter portfolio as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just lastly the way the balance sheet is positioned today if when were on this call a year from now lets say next july what kind of interest rate environment would be ideal for popular over the next months both long and short end of the curve jorge j garcía a senior vice president corporate comptroller popular inc i guess i could answer that basically if we have like a reduction in shortterm rates thats going to reduce the what we pay on the public sector deposits as carlos mentioned as well its a market linked with a lag so youd see some pressure coming down from our cost deposits from that standpoint and a steepening so any kind of intermediate level assets kind of repricing at a higher spread to short term rates is naturally what typically a bank likes but our positioning is relatively neutral right now so we dont were not really expecting major swings due to interest rates at least in our current balance sheet positioning carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group popular inc like popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 26jul2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice presidentcorporate finance group
