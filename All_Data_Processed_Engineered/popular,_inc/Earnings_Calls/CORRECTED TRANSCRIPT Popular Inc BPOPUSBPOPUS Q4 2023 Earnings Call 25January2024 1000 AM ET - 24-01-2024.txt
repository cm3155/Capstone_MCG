secondhalf of the year we have taken actions to address these developments and are attentive to the evolving credit landscape deposit balances increased by approximately million primarily due to a higher level of online deposits at popular bank the increase in tangible book value per share in the quarter was primarily driven by a decrease in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio please

the effect of the fdic assessment adjusted operating expenses were million a decrease of million from  and below our prior guidance of million the variance in the quarter was driven primarily by a million noncash goodwill impairment in  and lower credit card processing and transactional expense by million mainly due to volume incentives recognized during the quarter from the card networks for the year operating expenses increased by to billion driven primarily by the higher fdic deposit insurance expense the goodwill impairment taken in  personnel cost and expenses related to customer activity excluding the fdic assessment in  expenses were billion higher than in but below our original guidance of billion for we expect annual expenses in the range of billion to billion approximately half of the predicted increase in expenses is related to technology investments some that rolled over from the other half is mostly personnel expenses as we continue to invest in our people as well as expand our capabilities in cyber risk data and technology this guidance includes transformationrelated expenses our effective tax rate for the quarter was negative the additional fdic expense changed the mix of exempt versus taxable income increasing the proportion of exempt income in addition  included a tax benefit resulting from the filing of the tax returns that contributed to the negative rate for the quarter for the full year the effective tax rate was excluding the impact of the fdic assessment it was close to the lower end of our guidance of to in we expect the effective tax rate to be in a range from to please turn to slide net interest margin increased by basis point to in  on a taxable equivalent basis nim was an increase of basis points versus  the increase was driven by improved earning asset mix higher loan yields and balances across most major lending categories as well as higher yields on our cash balances and investments this was offset by higher interest expense on deposits due to increased cost of public deposits and growth in highcost deposit accounts of popular bank at the end of the fourth quarter puerto rico public deposits were billion an increase of roughly million compared to  and at the upperend of our guidance in we expect public deposits to be in a range of billion to billion as usual seasonality should result in public deposit balances trending higher at the beginning of the year and peaking in  mostly related to tax receipts excluding puerto rico public deposits consolidated customer deposit balances were flat compared to  in puerto rico customer deposits decreased driven by commercial outflows for the year approximately billion in deposit balances were transferred by commercial and retail customers from bppr to popular securities in  deposit increases at popular bank were primarily driven by increases in time and saving deposits from our online channel ending loan balances increased by billion or compared to  driven by growth in most loan segments of bppr and by commercial and construction at pb in loan balances increased by billion or versus billion or in we will continue to take advantage of current opportunities to extend credit and improve the use and yield of our existing liquidity in we expect loan growth of to driven primarily by the commercial loan segments in both banks our interest rate sensitivity is relatively neutral we saw a small margin expansion in  and expect the margin to remain in an upward trajectory in the magnitude will depend on our loan and deposit growth and mix investment portfolio strategy as well as the pace of repricing of public funds and incrementally retail and commercial deposits in our us operation popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 please turn to slide deposit betas in the current tightening cycle are above the prior cycle we have seen a total cumulative deposit beta of todate driven by public deposits the rate of increase in deposit costs for the corporation continued to slow down in the quarter in bppr total deposit cost increased by basis points compared to an increase of basis points in  led by public deposits excluding public deposit balances total deposit costs remained flat at basis points at popular bank deposit cost increased by basis points compared to an increase of basis points in  led by retail deposits coming primarily through our online channel puerto rico government deposits are composed of numerous clients and accounts the calculation methodology and rate of those accounts may vary depending on the timing of shifts and the related balances within accounts on occasion we may also provide temporary pricing concessions as part of our customary relationship management activities in  the mix shift and the customer and the temporary preferential rates resulted in an overall increase of basis points in the cost of public deposits versus the basis points we had anticipated at the end of the third quarter we expect the cost of public deposits to remain flat in  please note that on page of our investor presentation we have added a page summarizing the expense guidance for which we are providing in this webcast please turn to slide our return on tangible equity was in the quarter for the fullyear our rotce was both ratios were impacted by the fdic assessment we continue to target a sustainable rotce by the end of regulatory capital levels remain strong our  common equity tier ratio of decreased by basis point from

multiple share repurchases including the return to our shareholders of the gain on sale of our evertec stake we will revisit future capital actions in the secondhalf of in the nearterm we continue to seek more clarity on the outlook for rate the economy and the proposed regulatory response to events in the banking sector our longterm outlook on capital return has not changed anchored by our strong regulatory capital ratios over time we expect our regulatory capital ratios to gravitate toward the levels of our mainland peers plus a buffer with that id turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc thank you carlos and good morning overall the corporations mortgage and commercial portfolios continue to reflect credit metrics significantly below prepandemic levels while credit quality metrics continue to normalize for puerto ricos personal loan credit cards and auto and lease finance loans we are closely monitoring the performance of our consumer portfolio and have made changes to our underwriting criteria to decrease exposure to higher risk segments for the year nonperforming loans decreased from million or of total loans to million or while net chargeoff increased from historic lows during the year they still compare very favorably against pre pandemic averages we continue to closely monitor changes in the macroeconomic environment and the borrower performance given higher interest rate and inflationary pressures we believe that the improvements popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 over recent years the risk management practices and the risk profile of the corporation loan portfolios positions popular to continue to operate successfully under the current environment turning to slide number nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans decreased slightly during the quarter driven by the mortgage portfolio in puerto rico commercial npls in puerto rico remained flat quarter overquarter notwithstanding the inflow of an million relationship in the renewable energy sector this relationship drove the increase in npl inflows for the quarter despite these inflows the ratio of npls to total loans held in portfolio decreased to from in the previous quarter turning to slide number net chargeoffs amounted to million or an annualized basis points of average loans held in portfolio compared to million or basis points in the prior quarter the increase was mainly in puerto rico and the biggest variances were seen in commercial and consumer net chargeoff commercial net chargeoffs were million or basis points a variance of million due to an million recovery in the previous quarter additionally consumer net chargeoffs were million higher due to the credit normalization in auto personal loan and credit cards as we have discussed in the past prior to the covid pandemic popular net chargeoffs were generally between and basis point for we expect net chargeoffs for the fullyear to be between to basis points due to the ongoing credit normalization and general economic environment please turn to slide number the allowance for credit losses increased by million to million this was driven by a reserve build in the puerto rico commercial portfolio due to a million specific reserve for the previously mentioned new npl loan growth and higher reserves for the consumer portfolios due to credit normalization in the us the acl increased by million driven by higher commercial loan reserve due to rating migration the corporation ratio of acl to loans held in portfolio remained flat at while the ratio of acl to npl stood at compared to in the previous quarter the provision for credit losses was million a million increase from the prior quarter was driven by the million specific reserve mentioned earlier and credit normalization of the puerto rico retail portfolios also contributing to the increase were third quarter event such as recoveries in the puerto rico commercial portfolio and the recalibration last quarter of the us cre allowance model which led to a million reduction in reserves to summarize our puerto rico consumer loan portfolio continued to normalize during the quarter while the corporation mortgage and commercial portfolios continue to reflect strong credit quality trends with low net chargeoffs and decreasing nonperforming loans we are attentive to the evolving environment but remain encouraged by the performance of our loan book with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks thank you ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your updates was a good year for popular despite a challenging environment which included high

great year we started with strong momentum and the team is energized we are now ready to answer your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from timur braziler of wells fargo timur please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc looking at the nii guidance its pretty impressive for especially considering the expectation for loan growth to moderate in the coming year twopart question first what are your rate assumptions embedded in that nii guidance and second can you maybe talk through nii cadence throughout the year especially now that public funds deposit costs have stabilized carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc all right indiscernible yeah timur the underlying rate our assumptions that are embedded in our forecast we are in the lowerend of the market as far as number of decreases in rates and we have them all in the secondhalf of the year that popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 changes every day of course today after gdp is lower than it was yesterday but so were at the lowend of the consensus range and the secondhalf of the year with regards to nii i mean the effect of the cost of government funds if in fact rates are flat are coming down should be pretty neutral moving forward in fact ive mentioned in my prepared comments that we expect the cost of deposits to remain flat for the first quarter so that will hopefully be one of the contributors the rest of the consumers are going to be dependent on their loan growth on what sector our loan growth happens the speed at which it happens and then the repricing of our investment portfolio as well as it continues to mature timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and carlos can you provide just how many rate cuts you are assuming in the backend of the year carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc two timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay maybe one for lidio so last quarter you called out the low fico used car borrower this quarter you called out credit cards personal loans and some segments of auto as being higher risk maybe just talk through the normalization of the consumer what would you classify as being higher risk balances and then how should we think about this segment relative to the current allowance allocation lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc i think as generally when youre looking at consumer and retail portfolios the highrisk segments are always going to be driven by fico so if you have lower fico indiscernible to be higher risk we have seen i think i last quarter i also mentioned the monetization of personal loans and credit cards and what we have seen this quarter is it continues along the spectrum i think maybe a gradual increase also in delinquencies and chargeoffs in auto lease which was maybe i did not mention in the last quarter but whats the last part of your question im sorry timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc within allowance ratio do you think this normalization causes increased allowance from here or is that normalization primarily in the chargeoffs with the allowance ratio staying relatively stable lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc i mean i think the normal we i expect normalization to continue maybe through the firsthalf of the year and the movement that you have seen our allowance should be replicated in the firsthalf which has been pretty consistent around the excluding any changes in economic forecast or anything like that popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and can you provide balances of what are the lower fico more higher risk consumer balances are lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc that is not a disclosure that we provide so no carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc what we do provide as you know in the appendix timur is the different consumer portfolios and the originations over time in a very extended of time so from that you will not get the actual balances that youre requesting but youll get a sense of where the portfolio is because i think we have eight or nine years worth of origination and most of these products have a life of two or three years lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc i think maybe most important timur looking at more from a macro context looking at the strength of the puerto rico economy the liquidity of our clients we dont foresee an acceleration of losses i mean were seeing a trend of normalization and thus our forecast embedded in the forecast and the guidance that we provided for losses next year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you for the questions and congrats carlos on a welldeserved retirement carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc thanks timur operator our next question comes from ben gerlinger of citi ben please go ahead benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good morning guys ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning ben carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc welcome popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc all right yeah thank you i was curious if we could just take a moment i know you said the loan growth is being partially funded by just a mix in the loans from securities how should we think about the overall balance sheet size it should be obviously lower growth than loans but should we and the static balance sheet size is somewhat acceptable or something we should expect or should we see a little bit of growth in the balance sheet as well carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc youve seen our balance sheet be pretty static actually this year despite the big loan growth because what ends up happening is that we have a big shift from securities and cash into the loan portfolio so i mean i dont balance sheet growth is not necessarily a target that were pursuing if it happens it happens but we still have significant amount of liquidity we still have significant amount of the investment portfolio maturing every quarter that is more than capable of funding loan growth so i would probably expect more shift from the investment portfolio and cash to loans and the overall size may not change a hell of a lot benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thanks that makes sense and then it seems like you are reinvesting some just given the amount of liquidity it ph spits off i was just curious where in the curve in terms of duration are you kind of approaching any sort of reinvestment carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah we are having all those discussions i have not made those decisions so ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no no but currently theyre being invested in shorterterm instruments such as us treasury bills carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah so its basically indiscernible in cash or cash like instruments timur sic ben but we are having the discussions of potential extension in the investment portfolio we have not executed any of that the extension we have achieved and its significant obviously is the move from cash to our loan book which has a much higher duration than cash benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you if i can just sneak one more into i know you gave the expense guidance is that if its the highend of the range on revenue should we expect highend of the range on expenses as well does that include some sort of a commission or bonus payment as well or is the potentially even higher revenue does come in on the high end popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc no the range does not necessarily include our profitsharing which i think is what youre referring to we do as you know we have to exceed our budget by a given margin for that to kick in so its not necessarily there i wish there was a perfect connection as you suggest between the highend of one the on the revenue and the high end on the expenses but thats not necessarily the case benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you appreciate the time carlos its been great working with you enjoy your retirement youve always been very helpful thank you carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc thank you operator our next question comes from alex twerdahl of piper sandler alex please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning all carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc good morning alex alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co just wanted to dig back into the nim a little bit or the nii guide in the past you guys have kind of quantified each rate cut or each rate hike has a very specific impact on nii each quarter are you able to do that or carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc well i mean i think the best way to think about that alex is to go back to my comment that we are largely rate neutral in our balance sheet composition right now so a change in rates will not have a very material effect in that range we provided okay because our balance sheet is to a large extent neutral to movement in rates in the shortterm alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then on slide the maturity schedule on the us treasury notes is it pretty fair to assume that the sort of billion or so that comes off each quarter is right around that yield lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 yes thats the right number alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then it just when i look at the net chargeoff guidance that you guys provided versus what weve seen over the last couple of years and really all the macro data and unemployment rate and sort of the momentum behind the economy it feels like the net chargeoff guide is being a little bit conservative are you when you come up with that guidance range is it are you looking at specific inputs or is it really just kind of a hunch that things kind of have to get worse from a pretty good pretty solid level where theyve been lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc i think its a combination of things we look obviously at trends recent trends and we also look at the expected economic forecast over the next year which we provide to you in our allowance slide so i think its a combination of factors those two being two of the most important factors alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay so i mean i think in the past carlos you have i think a comment that has stuck with me is that people when theyre employed tend to pay their bills and lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc yeah alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co and with unemployment being as strong as it has been and employment growing and all the momentum by the economy and potential tax additional tax breaks coming early this year for sort of the lowincome sector i mean it feels like you should be able to do much better than that or at least better than that to basis point range carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc i think alex that you have described the environment well as i think weve discussed in the past we are a little bit puzzled in trying to make the connection as well we are doing our best to understand the drivers on why this is happening when the underlying economy and employment situation is strong but what we are seeking to understand the connection better we also cannot ignore the fact that we are seeing the increased delinquencies and so we have to make sure that we reflect that in our outlook the other thing of course the environment in the mainland is equally positive and most banks in mainland are seeing similar deterioration in the consumer portfolio so i guess were not the only ones with the conundrum in trying to connect how the economy is going and employment is going versus how some clients are behaving but so were working on that alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 okay thanks for taking my questions carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc appreciate it operator next question comes from kelly motta of kbw kelly please go ahead kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thanks for the question carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc good morning kelly kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i guess carrying on with that and i got a little turned around earlier in the call when you were talking about net chargeoffs and the reserve i dont know if i picked up on that clearly i just wanted to circle back it looks like in your acl movement in slide you added about million related to consumer portfolio changes just wanted to confirm if thats related to that deterioration that you see in the consumer portfolio and if that implies that some of the increase that youre expecting may already be in your allowance lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc that portfolio change is a combination of things it is portfolio growth changing in credit quality its replenishing the net chargeoffs for the period so it is all of that combined leads to that million figure that you see in the slide kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats really helpful and then i guess touching turning around to the tax rate its come down a bit can you talk again i know theres some unique factors in puerto rico can you talk about whats taken your effective tax rate lower and what could cause us to come in the highend versus lowend of that range carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah i mean the drivers of the fourth quarter were the two i mentioned kelly is we because of the effect of the additional expense of the fdic assessment we ended up changing the mix of taxable versus exempt income and we ended ended the quarter with much higher proportion of exempt income versus nonexempt income that obviously affects our tax rate the other contributing factor is that we finished our tax returns and that resulted in a benefit that also lowered the taxes in the fourth quarter so those are the two effects i certainly hope not to see another fdic assessment and definitely not of the size of this one moving forward so that part of the condition should not popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 repeat itself and we already filed the taxes so i dont think we can refile them again anytime soon although theres always reviews and adjustments on those things so i think and ill look at my colleague here jorge whos ph a former tax expert i think the conditions that led to that variation are pretty idiosyncratic and pretty unique to the last quarter jorge j garcía a senior vice president corporate comptroller popular inc i would say this is jorge as we go forward i mean certainly the composition of taxable versus taxexempt income and that mix is always going to impact that range that were giving you so if its actually something that can grow faster or the contribution of it because of the disallowed expenses et cetera becomes a higher proportion our overall effective tax rate will come down but that condition will exist beyond any type of period adjustments that are more unique carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc thats why we give you a range kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you and i appreciate all the guidance maybe talking about fees can you it looks like it implies an increase at least with the highend relative to last year can you discuss some of the initiatives youve taken on one and then two have you done a review at all of how any of the proposed interchange and overdrafts might impact your fee income carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yes let me take the second part of your question first because its the simplest to answer i think in the last webcast we were asked of the potential effect of the elimination of late fees on credit cards and we mentioned that our estimate of the potential effect of that was something around million the additional things that are being discussed now that were not on the table last quarter is a potential reduction in overdraft nfs sic nsf fees we dont have nfs sic nsf fees for retail clients in either of our two banks we do have some overdraft fees but the effect of that is somewhat muted because overdraft fees in puerto rico are already capped at per occurrence and the proposal is in the highend the proposal of so in that front and of course the proposal can change our best guess is that the effect could be something between and million worth of loss fees and then the last piece of the puzzle that is in discussion now is the potential changes in interchange fees for debit and our best guess right now is that could have an effect of up to million or something in that ballpark so those three pieces are again all these are estimates will depend on how the final rule comes out and the levels that we end up setting and when it happens and everything else but those are the best estimates we have of a potential effect as far as lower fees now when we talk about the fees for i want to make sure that we dont lose context we lost a significant amount of fees in as the year evolved because of changes in nfs sic nsf and overdraft fees so our guidance went down and not in material amount because of our recognition that we had lost our fees in now we ended up doing a pretty good job and if you just look at the way of how our fees have changed popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 over time you probably wont be able to tell that in we lost a significant amount of fees because we were pretty good at substituting them with other income in the fee category the main contributors to that substitution are the two things that ignacio mentioned number one we have repriced our offering of cash management services in the corporate sector and that brought in additional fees and number two ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah thats the main driver carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc well yeah the main driver was that the repricing of cash management services so we ended up conceptually making up for the lost fees in and the year ended up pretty flat we expect some of the transformation efforts were doing to continue to add contribute to the fee income of the company that in part is why we are increasing the guidance somewhat and its not a big increase but its an increase that ph is not unimportant at all ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah we also saw an increase in the interchange fees from our small commercial credit card i think thats the other thats the second factor i dont think i mentioned it but thats the second factor carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc thank you kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats helpful last question for me indiscernible new loans are being originated now just to get a sense of the power of redeploying those cash flows that are coming off carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah i mean as you know kelly we havent provided that information in the past and we are all done with adding guidance and information for this kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc fair enough i thought i could slip one by the goalie thank you ill step back carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc but i mean obviously this will vary but you have the yields of our different books and our levels and yields in the press release and you can work off of that as a guide at least to start your work of front and back books popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc awesome thanks so much carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from brody preston of ubs brody please go ahead brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc hey brody how are you brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc good good how are you carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc good thank you brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i just wanted to ask within the nii guidance i think i heard you that you got two cuts in the backhalf of the year but wanted to ask what you all are assuming for a retail and commercial deposit beta within that nii growth guidance carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc we have not discussed forwardlooking beta brody but i think its not unreasonable to assume that the rate of increase in beta should subside with stable rates and more so if rates start to drop but we have not given details on the forwardlooking beta brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay i wanted to circle back to the consumer credit discussion i just want to make sure the consumer credit allowance is about right so that looks relatively unchanged quarteroverquarter actually it came down just a little bit just given the growth of the loan portfolio i guess the first question there is whats the life of loan assumption for the consumer book under cecl popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc i mean obviously all of consumer books is pretty shortdated in terms of duration so well call it lets call it a year two years thereabout brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and is this the level that you had for annualized chargeoffs in the consumer book when i just kind of quickly look back at my model it looked like outside of a couple of quarters during covid this is the highest period for consumer credit losses that you all have had either from a dollar amount or from a nco rate perspective and so is this the kind of new level that we should expect to see here and if it is if its two years and were talking about of chargeoffs is there a case to be made that we need to walk the consumer reserve incrementally higher from here than where it actually is carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc youre asking a lot of question but i will say this i mean well go back to what i mentioned in our prepared remarks our outlook for in terms of losses is we expect losses next year to be between to basis point a lot of the drivers in the losses are associated with our retail book we expect normalization to continue in those portfolios so well see and we are close in terms of the losses that we experienced prior to the pandemic vis a vis the losses that were experiencing today as i also mentioned we remain positive for the outlook of our consumer books given the strength of the economy and the liquidity of our clients brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it so is there anything specific going on thats causing the chargeoff rate to move to a level thats kind of at the highend i guess of what you would consider normal just given the strength of the economy and given the fact that employment is so strong on the island lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc i think thats part of the conundrum that carlos referred to we have seen i mean you have also seen banks in the us experience the same in terms of even in the face of a very strong economy youre seeing consumer portfolios deteriorate i mean if you wanted me to speculate i could say i mean there is potentially a couple of things i will say they played out of inflation on higher rates as having an impact in the cash flows of some of our customers that we might be leading to strategic defaults and i mean there is if you look at some of the analysis and studies done by some of the credit bureaus there is something that relate they call fico inflation in which after the pandemic the ficos of a lot of the consumers went up and that also created an environment in which now ficos are behaving a little bit worse than they behaved prior to the pandemic carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc brody one more thing brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 got it indiscernible yeah go ahead carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc brody youve heard lidio before say that historically our losses has gravitated in a range between and basis points so the range of losses were talking about to basis points is sort of in the lowend of that historic range so i wouldnt characterize that range as a very highlevel of losses its the lowend of our historic ranges brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc no the commercial book and the resi mortgage has been great for you guys i was speaking more specifically carlos to the consumer book standalone by itself so thank you much for taking my question guys ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you brody carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc youre welcome operator operator instructions our next question comes from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard please go ahead thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone this is thomas leddy calling in on behalf of gerard carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc hey thomas lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc hey thomas thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc the commercial relationship in the pr commercial portfolio that you guys called out as driving the npl inflows in the quarter i think you said it was in the renewable energy sector is there any further color you can give us there are you guys keeping a closer eye on similar relationships ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 yeah this is ignacio and lidio is going to answer in more detail but really that case is idiosyncratic i mean the things that led to that problem have nothing to do with the industry in general its more internal to that client lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc we dont have any significant exposure in that industry either so thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it thats helpful and then just highlevel given the positioning of the balance sheet today you guys mentioned pretty rateneutral over the shortterm what kind of an interest rate environment would be ideal for popular over the next to months both on the short and longend of the curve carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc thats a better question i the generic answer for us a normal curve is the thing we wish for are going to get a normal curve in the next to months i dont know thomas but generically a normal curve will always make the business of banking easier thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it fair enough thank you for taking my questions and congratulations carlos on your retirement carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc thanks thomas lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc thank you operator our next question is a follow up from timur braziler of wells fargo timur please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks for the followup just looking at capital repatriation can you provide us an update or a reminder as to when capital plan submission conversation is with your regulators and what we could potentially expect from a timing standpoint in reengaging a buyback carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc yeah i mentioned that the second half of the year historically we have done our stress test in the third quarter and that has normally been an important part of our discussions but i think we also we have also mentioned a number of times that we are rethinking how we manage our capital return activities weve also mentioned that in all probability we will gravitate to a format thats more similar to what other banks do meaning that we will popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 probably not be announcing a buyback and immediately doing an asr but rather be announcing an authorization for a buyback to execute it over a period of time thats the kind of changes were talking about in conjunction with those changes we may also change other parts of how we do capital planning so well historically the our stress tests in the third quarter have been an important contributor theres even that is something that we may change depending on things evolve so its on the same ph timing process timur our best guess right now is that that we will number one get the clarity were looking for in the three factors we mentioned rates economy and regulator by the summer and then that would allow us to reengage from that front thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thanks for the color carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officercorporate finance group popular inc thank you operator with that ill hand back to ignacio for closing remarks ignacio
