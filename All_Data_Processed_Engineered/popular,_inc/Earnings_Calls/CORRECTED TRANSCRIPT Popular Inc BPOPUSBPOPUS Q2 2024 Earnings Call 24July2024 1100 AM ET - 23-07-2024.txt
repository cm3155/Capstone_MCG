core results particularly the nii growth and the expansion of the nim net interest income increased by million our net interest margin increased by basis points on a gaap basis and basis points on a tax equivalent basis driven by the repricing of loans and securities and higher balances loan growth improved this quarter to yeartodate driven by bppr where we saw loan growth across nearly all categories led by commercial lending auto and mortgage originations the underlying economic activity in puerto rico remains strong however the demand for credit in our us market continues to be less than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year as a result we now expect consolidated loan growth to be towards the low end of our original to guidance consolidated customer deposit balances excluding puerto rico public deposits were flat as increases in time deposits at popular bank were offset by outflows at bppr however average customer balances during the quarter were higher including noninterestbearing demand deposits at the end of the second quarter puerto rico public deposits were billion up billion compared to  and above the upper end of our yearend guidance range  is typically the peak in public deposit balances and is mostly related to tax receipts normal annual seasonality should result in these balances trending lower for the rest of the year by the end of we expect public deposits to be near the upper end of our billion to billion guidance while higher balances of public deposits contribute to higher nii approximately million of lowcost governmentrelated accounts managed by our fiduciary services group were repriced during the quarter to marketlinked rates offsetting in part the benefit of the higher balances as a result of the shift of the deposit mix toward higher cost deposits along with a slower loan growth in the us we now expect our yearoveryear growth in nii to be to noninterest income was million an increase of million from  driven primarily by higher credit card and debit card fees from customer transaction activity we continue to expect noninterest income to be approximately million to million per quarter during the second quarter we were also very pleased to see the continued improvement in credit metrics the provision for credit losses of million was million lower than the first quarter total operating expenses were million or million higher than last quarters adjusted operating expense the increase was driven by professional fees due to advisoryrelated expenses and increase to reserves for operational losses and higher transactional expenses tied to client activity these increases were offset in part by lower personnel expenses which are traditionally higher during the first quarter of the year due to annual incentive awards and payroll taxes we continue to expect total expenses in the range of billion to billion our effective tax rate for the quarter was compared to a adjusted tax rate in the prior quarter as we benefited from higher tax exempt income and certain tax credit during the quarter we continue to expect the effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of to popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 please turn to slide net interest margin increased by basis points on a taxable equivalent basis nim was an increase of basis points the increase was driven by higher earning asset yields and balances this benefit was partially offset by higher interest expense on deposits due to increased average balances of public deposits at bppr and time deposits at popular bank during the quarter we continued to see the benefits in the contribution of the investment portfolio as lowyielding maturities are reinvested in shortterm tbills that are taxexempt in puerto rico this improved the tax effective yield of the securities portfolio by basis points to in bppr the cost of total deposits increased by basis points to the total deposit costs at bppr continue to be impacted by the proportion of public deposits to total deposits at popular bank deposit costs increased by basis points during the quarter this change reflected a significant stabilization when compared to an increase of basis points in  we expect a continued nim expansion throughout the rest of please turn to slide regulatory capital levels remained strong our cet ratio of increased by basis points from  tangible value per share at the end of the quarter was an increase of per share from  return on tangible common equity improved by nearly basis points in the quarter to we continue to target a sustainable return on tangible common equity by the end of as ignacio mentioned we announced an increase in our quarterly common dividend of per share to we expect our board

performance given higher interest rates and inflationary pressures we remain encouraged by the performance of our loan book turning to slide number nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans decreased during the quarter driven by the bppr segment npls and bppr decreased by million reflecting improvements across most loan categories npls in the popular bank segment remained flat driven by the return to accrual of a million mortgage loan offset by a million commercial npl inflow oreo has decreased in bppr by million driven by the sale of a commercial real estate property inflows of npls

netcharge off in bppr decreased by million driven by lower consumer by million and lower commercial by million the decrease in consumer net chargeoff were driven by lower auto by million and lower personal loans by million in popular bank net chargeoff decreased by million due to lower consumer net chargeoffs given the credit performance in the first half of the year and our outlook for the second half we now expect net chargeoffs to be near the low end of our initial full year guidance of basis points to basis points please turn to slide number the allowance for loan losses decreased by million to million and bppr ratio remained flat i think this is driven by higher commercial loan volumes higher qualitative reserves and changes in credit quality were offset by changes in the macroeconomic scenarios and net chargeoffs in popular bank the acl decreased by million mainly driven by lower reserves for the commercial portfolio due to risk rating improvements the corporation ratio of acl to loans heldinportfolio decreased slightly from to while the ratio of acl to npls improved slightly from in the previous quarter to this quarter the provision for loan losses was million

colleagues for their continued dedication and commitment to serve our customers and contribute to our success popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 we are now ready to answer your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from kelly motta with kbw your line is open please go ahead kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning thanks for the question ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc good morning kelly kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i would like to start out with the capital plan it certainly came at least a quarter sooner than i had expected just wondering i know you guys were waiting for some clarity on the outlook before coming out with something has anything changed in terms of your comfort level with where youre viewing the capital position and the outlook ahead that allowed you to come out with this in july and also wondering any guideposts we should be thinking about in terms of what your constraining capital ratio is and how youre thinking about stepping in with the buyback especially with the run weve had in the stock thanks ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah obviously we hear our investors and our board and managers are very conscious that people wanted a statement from us on where we were on a capital return we worked very hard with our group we went through some analysis of our credit book and what we thought about the future and we thought that the million authorization was the appropriate amount given the circumstances we also thought given our view that the dividend increase was important i think thats an important piece of the puzzle so obviously that shows our confidence in the future in terms of where were going were going to do open market purchases we still think that the stock is fairly valued so we i really have more insight to that but we still believe that the stock is fairly valued especially relative to our peers and others in the industry kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 got it okay thats really helpful and then with the nii outlook being reduced just a point of clarification the to growth that youre currently projecting for this year is that on a gaap basis or an fte because there are some moving parts with the fte adjustment this year that does make it somewhat meaningful jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc yeah thank you for the question kelly yeah all of our guidance is gaap basis kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats helpful and with your outlook for government deposits to decline off of that billion level where were at now as we look ahead should we be thinking about the balance sheet as being relatively flat from here given the movement in government front funds between now and yearend jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc i mean certainly if i would expect the movement if you see a decrease in deposits we would not be leveraging of the balance sheet with alternative sources of liquidity so i think thats a fair statement in terms of more or less around that level of decrease of public funds kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you ill step back operator we now turn to timur braziler with wells fargo your line is open please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc wondering on the million of lowcost government deposits managed by fiduciary services that were repriced this quarter just wondering what drove that when did that happen in the quarter and how much of a headwind from an average standpoint will flow into from those actions popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc thank you timur first the repricing is baked into our guidelines so our updated guidance takes into account this repricing it happened towards the end of the quarter and i think at the beginning of june so i mean i dont know if theres any other part of the question there timur can you i think indiscernible timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc no thats helpful and then just what drove that businesses ph or that action jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc as you know i mean these are client relationships we have communications and conversation with our clients and we react to market conditions and client expectations timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe just following up on kellys fte question can you just give us an update on where you expect fte for the year in context of the updated guide how much of that revision was driven by indiscernible jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc yeah timur we dont usually give guidance on fte basis our guidance is all gaap basis the tax rate we do provide you the tax rate so it allows you to at least get a sense of the flow to eps timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay but should we expect further reinvestment into taxadvantaged tbills or has that remixing largely played out jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc no if you probably remember we have about billion a quarter in maturities in our investment portfolio we currently continue to invest in tbills or fund loan growth so ultimately we havent exhausted our potential for tax expense and security timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc but again ill leave you with that as you go with our popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then i guess the last jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc top line guidance and tax effective rate timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it and then just last for me just around the cadence for buybacks is the expectation that we go back to a january authorization as weve seen in the past or is this million more or less for a year and the next board authorization or board decision will take place a year from now in july ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no no this is an openended authorization we dont have the time a time limit on it and we will execute under this authorization and if things change then well let you know but this is an openended authorization with no specific time limit jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc and were not expecting to go back to the annual general cadence timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc we want to have the flexibility to react to market conditions timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for that operator our next question comes from jared shaw with barclays your line is open please go ahead jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning maybe first just if we look at the fees and expenses to get into your guidance range whats where should we i guess expect to see lower fees and where should we expect to see a faster pace of expense growth popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc so lets talk about the expenses first you know that various seasonality in expenses for example merit increases our personnel costs are a significant portion of our expenses our merit increased schedule is in the summer so that is an expense that will be accretive or an incremental expense that well see in the second half of the year we continue to have efforts around the transformation professional fees technology as these are not symmetric throughout the year so in terms of fee income there is there are a lot of components to that fee income some of it comes from our equity pickup investment in bank that we have today in the dominican republic theres transactional activity from clients i mean there are a lot of variances and frankly million or million up or down any quarter its not an unusual variance jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay all right thanks and then when we look at credit good trends in credit and chargeoffs do you think that weve seen peak consumer chargeoffs here and where should we expect to see the acl settle out is this a good rate as a ratio of loans or is there still room for that to move lower lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc right a lot of that ph where you asked its going to be economy dependent we feel and were comfortable with the state of the economy and the economy or the outlook for the economy going forward and so ill leave it at that i mean the rate and the chargeoff on the top of the acl will depend on the economy jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay indiscernible though you still feel pretty confident on the general trajectory at this point it sounds like lidio v soriano a executive vice president chief risk officercorporate risk management group popular inc we do yes jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thank you operator we now turn to gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open please go ahead thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning this is thomas leddy calling on behalf of gerard loan growth has remained pretty solid now for several consecutive quarters while some of your peers have seen negative growth in recent periods acknowledging you guys have guided to the lower end of your overall loan growth range as you look ahead popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 given the remaining sort of idiosyncratic tailwinds for the island specifically could loan growth for bppr actually accelerate from here as some of the construction projects you guys have referenced historically sort of come online ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc so this is ignacio i think we would reiterate the guidance weve given i think we feel pretty good about the economic activity in puerto rico we are seeing a lot of positive economic activity investment from outside the island entrepreneurs locally so we feel pretty good and if you saw the results we are seeing loan growth in puerto rico whats holding us back a little bit is that the us like many of our peers in the us that especially they focus a lot on commercial real estate that loan growth has been slower and slower than we expected so again in general we reiterate the guidance we feel good about puerto rico but we feel that the us has been a bit slower than we actually had expected thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful and then i guess just more broadly can you give us some color regarding your appetite for actually growing that mainland portfolio in the face of whats expected to remain a pretty uncertain credit environment in the back end of this year and into early next year ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i would say generally i dont really ph going to answer that were comfortable with the portfolio that we have but obviously weve been as most banks we have been prudently looking at the market and we are being careful especially in the commercial real estate sector but were very comfortable with the portfolio we had so again there is a lot of pressure in general from regulators and others to sort of make sure your growth in that area is cautious so well be cautious like the rest of the market commercial real estate but we have other areas that were hopeful the condominium association that i think is an area were expecting to see some more growth from but yeah well be cautious with the commercial real estate just like everyone else thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful thank you for taking my questions operator operator instructions we now turn to samuel varga with ubs your line is open please go ahead samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc good morning i just wanted to turn back to those lower cost of government deposits for question after the million thats already been repriced how much more do you have in lower cost balances and can you give any sense for the sort of difference between the reset yield and the original one jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 yeah im not going to give specific information on the reset i will tell you that you can see in the levels and yield these deposits are categorized as time deposits so you can get a sense of the increase in the cost in that segment of our levels and yield schedule in terms of other large lowcost im not aware of any significant amounts that would reprice or are subject to repricing samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much operator we have a followup question from kelly motta with kbw your line is open please go ahead kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thank you so much for letting me back in i have two questions if i could sneak in the first is on just a clarification on the tax rate the taxadvantaged income brought down the tax rate considerably this quarter from last and i think you also had some discrete items impacting last quarter i know you guide on a fullyear basis but would it be fair to say within that range is a good starting point to for forecasting the back half of this year jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc i think as you mentioned the quarter did have some discrete events that may not recur so that is something that i wouldnt certainly not multiply it times i guess so i kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc i mean weve given the guidance i think you can work on to i mean its gaap guidance so you know what the first quarter was second quarter and i think you can get a sense of what the rates indiscernible kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i got it jorge j garcía a executive vice president chief financial officer corporate finance group popular inc to achieve it kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc fair enough and then i was hoping if you could spend a minute talking about your insurance subsidiary weve seen a couple of banks sell those at a considerable gain as well as your stake in the dominican bank just popular inc bpop corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 wondering if you know how management is viewing these businesses and if theres any potential gains that could be harvested from that ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes let me start by saying we dont have any current plans to sell either of those investments obviously like any business we always we look at every opportunity but it is not in our current plans in terms of the bhd thats been a very successful investment for us it produces a steady amount of income every quarter as mentioned or it was mentioned the equity pick up has been very good they also produce a cash dividend which brings money to the holding company its a wellrun bank in a growing economy so wed have to have a much better use for our money the tax implication of selling that would not be great to the dominican republic so it wouldnt be right now weve looked at it but really i think were going to hold that investment and in insurance its very important for us its one of the things and one of our thesis is how we can become more embedded in the lives of our clients and i think insurance is an area in puerto rico where many of our citizens are underinsured and we think we can add value to them by bringing a comprehensive suite of services so thats not something that in my mind right now we would sell i think its an important part of our fee business and we like it kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for taking the time operator this concludes our qa i want to hand back to ignacio alvarez ceo for closing remarks ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you very much for joining us today and for your questions and we look forward to updating you and talking to you again on our third quarter results in october thank you very much operator ladies and gentlemen todays call has now
