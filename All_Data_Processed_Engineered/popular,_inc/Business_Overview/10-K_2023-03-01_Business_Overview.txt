categorized based on status as a us gsib size and four other riskbased indicators among bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets the most stringent standards apply to us gsibs which are subject to category i standards and the least stringent standards apply to category iv organizations which have between billion and billion in total consolidated assets and less than billion in all four other riskbased indicators and which are also not us gsibs bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more are subject to risk committee and risk management requirements as of december popular had total consolidated assets of billion transactions with affiliates bppr and pb are subject to restrictions that limit the amount of extensions of credit and certain other covered transactions as defined in section of the federal reserve act between bppr or pb on the one hand and popular pna or any of our other nonbanking subsidiaries on the

affiliate would exceed of the banks capital stock and surplus or the aggregate amount of the banks covered transactions with all affiliates would exceed of the banks capital stock and surplus in addition any transaction between bppr or pb on the one hand and popular pna or any of our other nonbanking subsidiaries on the other is required to be carried out on an arms length basis source of financial strength the doddfrank act requires bank holding companies such as popular and pna to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks popular and pna are expected to commit resources to support their subsidiary banks including at times when popular and pna may not be in a financial position to provide such resources any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary depository institutions are subordinated in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary depository institution in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment bppr and pb are currently the only insured depository institution subsidiaries of popular and pna resolution planning a bank holding company with billion or more in total consolidated assets or that is a category iii firm based on certain riskbased indicators described in the tailoring rules is required to report periodically to the fdic and the federal reserve board such companys plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure in addition insured depository institutions with total assets of billion or more are required to submit to the fdic periodic contingency plans for resolution in the event of the institutions failure in june the fdic issued a statement on resolution plans for insured depository institutions which among other things establishes a threeyear filing cycle for banks with billion or more in total assets and provides details regarding the content that filers will be expected to prepare as of december popular pna bppr and pbs total assets were below the thresholds for applicability of these rules fdic insurance substantially all the deposits of bppr and pb are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund dif of the fdic and bppr and pb are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif deposit insurance assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets of the insured depository institution minus the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period for larger depository institutions with over billion in assets such as bppr and pb the fdic uses a scorecard methodology which considers camels ratings among other measures that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large institution will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the dif if such a failure occurs the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate for larger depository institutions ranges from to basis points on an annualized basis after the effect of potential baserate adjustments the total base assessment rate could range from to basis points on an annualized basis on october the fdic finalized a rule that would increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of the fdic as required under the federal deposit insurance act fdia established a plan in september to restore the dif reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of percent within eight years the increased assessment is intended to improve the likelihood that the dif reserve ratio would reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline of september as of december we had a dif average total asset less average tangible equity assessment base of approximately billion brokered deposits the fdia and regulations adopted thereunder restrict the use of brokered deposits and the rate of interest payable on deposits for institutions that are less than well capitalized there are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized see prompt corrective action below for a description of the standard of well capitalized popular does not believe the brokered deposits regulations have had or will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity of bppr and pb capital adequacy popular popular bppr and pb are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal banking agencies the capital rules which implement the basel iii framework set forth by basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act among other matters the capital rules i impose a capital measure called common equity tier cet1 and the related regulatory capital ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets ii specify that tier capital consists of cet1 and additional tier capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements and iii mandate that most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital under the capital rules for most banking organizations including popular the most common form of additional tier capital is noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of tier capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses in each case subject to the capital rules specific requirements pursuant to the capital rules the minimum capital ratios are cet1 to riskweighted assets tier capital that is cet1 plus additional tier capital to riskweighted assets total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets and tier capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements known as the leverage ratio the capital rules also impose a capital conservation buffer composed entirely of cet1 on top of these minimum risk weighted asset ratios the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and eligible retained income that is four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income thus popular bppr and pb are required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of of cet1 effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least ii tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least and iii total capital to risk weighted assets of at least in addition under prior riskbased capital rules the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss aoci items included in stockholders equity for example markstomarket of securities held in the available for sale portfolio under us gaap were reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios pursuant to the capital rules the effects of certain aoci items are not excluded however nonadvanced approaches banking organizations including popular bppr and pb may make a onetime permanent election to continue to exclude these items popular bppr and pb have made this election in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of their securities portfolios the capital rules preclude certain hybrid securities such as trust preferred securities from inclusion in bank holding companies tier capital trust preferred securities no longer included in populars tier capital may nonetheless be included as a component of tier capital popular has not issued any trust preferred securities since may as of december popular has million of trust preferred securities outstanding which no longer qualify for tier capital treatment but instead qualify for tier capital treatment the capital rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 nonadvanced approaches banking organizations are subject to rules that provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for certain mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital failure to meet capital guidelines could subject popular and its depository institution subsidiaries to a variety of enforcement remedies including the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and to certain restrictions on our business refer to prompt corrective action below for further discussion in december the basel committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the basel iii post crisis regulatory reforms among other things these standards revise the basel committees standardized approach for credit risk including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital the basel framework contemplates that these standards will generally be effective on january with an aggregate output floor phasing in through january the federal bank regulators have not yet proposed rules implementing these standards under the current us capital rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to popular bppr and pb the impact of these standards on us will depend on the manner in which they are implemented by the federal bank regulators in december the federal banking agencies approved a final rule modifying their regulatory capital rules and providing an option to phase in over a period of three years the dayone regulatory capital effects of the current expected credit loss cecl model of asu the final rule also revised the agencies other rules to reflect the update to the accounting standards popular has availed itself of the option to phase in over a period of three years the day one effects on regulatory capital from the adoption of cecl in federal bank regulators adopted a rule that allowed banking organizations to elect to delay temporarily the estimated effects of adopting cecl on regulatory capital until january and subsequently to phase in the effects through january under the rule during and the adjustment to cet1 capital reflects the change in retained earnings upon adoption of cecl at january plus of the increase in the allowance for credit losses since january refer to the consolidated financial
