is yours ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea group executive chair banco santander sa so thank you begoña and good morning to everybody thanks for joining us so was marked by the tragic return of war to europe it has not been an easy year and certainly very different to what we all expected months ago clearly this has impacted in a big way the economic and macroenvironment i believe were in a new era that these conditions of high inflation and higher rates will be here for a while central bank is of course tightening monetary policy increased rates remember we had six years of negative rates in europe and quite a few years in the us the result of all of this is that we have a lot more uncertainty and santander has shown with the results we published today that were wellprepared to deal with this were actually quite accustomed to dealing in inflationary environments for many years including the last ones of course in latin america we delivered record results and i want to stress and achieved our commitments that we set before the war in ukraine started this is thanks to our customer focus our scale both in market and global and this is whats driving the profitable growth that you have seen we actually increased loans by and deposits by nearly billion we welcomed million new customers to the bank we increased revenues and profits by doubledigit this is a record profit and i want to stress also that most of this increase is driven by the improvements in the operational model that we have been executing and profitability of course increased again with a rote of and a strong eps growth of in the year last but not least we continue to strengthen the balance sheet not just capital but our overall balance sheet so let me give you some details of that if you look at the income statement you can see continued progress in the execution of our strategy reflected in the revenue growth i said already that this is a lot to do with more customers and more volumes banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 there is also some impact from higher rates especially in europe and north america and as youve seen in  this will continue into the new year net interest income rose improving quarteronquarter we increased fee income very importantly fee income supported by our global businesses ie by our global scale businesses by payments and increasing network benefits across our geographies we managed to grow our costs below inflation in all regions improving the efficiency ratio and the focus on improving operational performance led to a record net operating income of billion this is equivalent to of loans we are proud of the sustainability and the low volatility of our results across the cycle this is something which is not new but its really important to highlight why this happens this happens because of total revenues is net interest income on fees this compares with in our global peers and this is incredibly important because of the sustainability of our results and the quality of our results we really believe that again in challenging times our model is better and the cost of risk ended the year at just under as per our target which we set in january of last year and this all results of course in the record profits attributable profit of billion héctor grisi who is here with me our new ceo will give you more details about all this later so i want to now focus on our shareholders the increased profitability and this is not new this has happened year after year with the exception of covid allowed us to increase shareholder value creation our rote of was exceeding our yearend target exceeding our european peers profitability and as i said this is on the back of both strong profit growth but also the reduced number of shares following the buybacks of about our earnings per share grew which again is ahead of our peers we delivered growth in shareholder value creation even with a negative impact this year from interest rates which affected the balance sheet and of course part of this has already begun to reverse in january if we exclude this temporary impact growth would have been close to we expect a increase in cash dps against results in the next few weeks we will announce the second dividend which will include again cash and buybacks and at current prices share buybacks we believe are still one of the most effective ways to generate shareholder value in the last two years as i said weve repurchased of outstanding shares this doesnt include the one we will be announcing soon and the return on investment is about for our shareholders so just looking at our balance sheet and i think here its important to give the message that we this is a holistic management of the balance sheet capital of course is important but so is credit and liquidity and the overall risk profile including credit remains medium low it has once again proven to be predictable based on our diversification and the control we have over our portfolios delivering on the guidance we set months ago and the npl ratio improved cost of risk in line with target liquidity extremely important for us we have a very conservative position its not just that the balance sheet remains funded by very high quality liabilities based on stable customer retail deposits in core markets where were market leaders or top three its also that our liquidity ratios remain well above requirements and this is even after the tltro accelerated repayments as you can see the lcr ratio stood at in december banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 and last but not least we again delivered on what we said at the beginning of this year of having our cet1 above every quarter our capital performance this year was better than many of our peers our capital levels have again shown the strength of our model they were the maybe amongst the least volatile in the latest european banking stress test very importantly we have continued to be very disciplined in how we allocate our capital and we have reached the target we set the year ago of keeping profitability of of rwas above cost of equity this compares with last year and improved the front book rorwa this is really important to the back book is at so if you ask me what is the biggest progress weve made this year is really leveraging what is unique about santander which is that we have both inmarket scale and global scale in large markets with growth potential and again these numbers show the success and the strength of our model and our strategy firstly now inmarket scale in each of our core markets here you have it run by lending its a strong competitive advantage were among the top three lenders in out of our core markets in the us we have an atscale us auto business that benefits from the network santander network in terms of oem relationships and compared to our local peers we are already leaders in profitability in out of these markets and indiscernible in brazil weve been number one in profitability in two of the last four years but really where the biggest opportunity lies is in that our global reach on a global scale and divisions like cib corporate investment banking our wealth management ill tell you about this now in a few minutes and further leveraging our auto and payments capabilities generates a differential revenue and growth profitable growth opportunities and these four segments and this is important today represent more than of total group revenue in these four divisions of total group revenue and over of the profit much of which would not be possible without this collaboration and network that santander provides we will explain more about this in investor day but just to share with you what weve done this year because weve been working on this not just in but before that so again this inmarket scale in each of our geographies has proven that its a key competitive advantage héctor will cover that in more detail and were still working on that by the way but our global scale is already providing us with this valueadded network which is unique a unique combination and let me just share some examples the best example this year as i say the proof is in the pudding is santander corporate investment banking we are leaders in latin america weve built a strong franchise in europe and were strengthening our position in the us were recognized as global leaders and have been in the top three over the last years in businesses related to energy transition and infrastructure both of which are expected to grow in a significant way in the next few years here we have got not just in our footprint but globally weve created a global network for cib customers that generates revenue that local countries cannot generate alone and this crossborder collaboration revenue not achievable by local banks and which we measure weve measured for several years was billion in and represents of cib total revenue and is growing at last year again this is a differential performance versus our peers theres no other bank that has this combination of being very strong inmarket and very strong in certain verticals globally so weve outperformed peers as you can see in revenue and profit growth efficiency and profitability banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 the other global division that has made huge progress the last few years is wealth management this is a very high return business were executing on same as weve done for cib for the last few years on our global platform plans and again already we have a better efficiency ratio compared to peers what we are doing in terms of private banking services to our customers that purely local banks cannot provide by connecting the service to our private banking customers we brought in more than billion of aums and again was not an easy year for this business our revenue growth and our profitability outperformed both in private banking and asset management and last one would be insurance where we have achieved gross written premiums growth of almost double our peers we have two other network businesses that are really increasingly being used by the countries and just very briefly to say that even though this is not a global division we are actually a worldwide leader in auto financing we are clearly number one in europe in terms of both volumes and profitability weve built we are building proprietary platforms with a competitive edge leasing subscription buynowpaylater digital tools for our oem partners and our us auto business is already benefiting from this competitive edge weve started to replicate this model in south america building common tech to deploy leasing activities and other products this is not the only network effect but let me just focus on the global relationships with oems and our knowledge of this business means that for example in chile and mexico we went from no presence to about market share in just three years and in mexico congratulations héctor by the way we broke even in march but the key number is that today around of our business in the americas is related to our oems partnerships in europe this business would not be available to local auto finance companies in payments we manage million cards globally this would make us one of the top banks or the top three or top four banks in the world by number of cards and of course customers that have a card tend to do more business with the bank were expanding our merchant capabilities again our acquiring business getnet was ranked among the top three merchant acquirers in latin america getnet again has rapidly grown in mexico as we left our third party provider we moved from a market share of in to in and as you know this is a key product to engage our customers and be able to do more business in the bank were currently number two by total payment volume again we would not have been able to do this in mexico without our network and the santander valueadded as a group very importantly and there is no immediate effect but thats going to be seen in the next few years we are bringing all of our customer payments globally into a single cloudbased modern payments platform which will deliver in future years many more benefits were executing on this plan and it will generate savings already these two years as well as having a much more modern agile platform so again all of this is supported by our tech investments as a group which are many of them youre seeing in the numbers that we deliver at a high level much more on this and how were going to continue delivering not just great results for customers but for shareholders we will cover that at the investor day banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 so let me just end with saying that the strong position of our local banks and the progress weve made serving our customers is seen in the growth in customer numbers we now weve grown million up to million customers thats an increase were making strong and very clear advances in the digital space which is accelerating our digital customers already reached million digital transactions are at of the total exceeding both our customer and digital activity levels were improving customer experience and very importantly were delivering these results in the right way weve taken a very important step to integrate further our environmental social governance issues into the daytoday we created a green and energy transition finance team which reports to the ceo to the cib and the ph ceo to embed consistent practices in green finance across all our business units including how we help our retail customers not just our big customers transition we see a huge opportunity here as well as a huge responsibility to support the transition of our customers to a green economy you have here the targets were ahead of our targets we committed to do billion of green finance we are at billion we remain a global leader in renewables financing number two in the world by deals and volumes were moving forward in our net zero ambition we have three new interim targets to decarbonize our portfolios importantly were now accelerating this in consumer we did billion mainly electric vehicles but also bicycles and others and in wealth management were also making progress we had achieved billion of our commitment of billion aums in socially responsible investment none of this would be possible without the work we are doing with our teams and our culture its something which is maybe not evident in the numbers but it is behind the numbers and to me its at the core of our success and im very excited about what héctor brings to the table here no pressure its our ability to build a culture of teamwork attract and retain the best team members and of course work as one santander but very importantly also our work to have financial inclusion and again you can see the results of these efforts both internally and externally we have highly engaged employees well within the top of the financial sector we measure this we are very proud of the progress in gender equality by the way were named again number one bank in the world and number two company globally in terms of diversity gender diversity last i think two days ago by bloomberg and really closing the gap to zero hopefully soon on the pay gap we have many more woman in top management roles we set ourselves at increase for ph to a couple of years ago by sorry by to be at were very proud to be at this year financial inclusion is a hugely important goal for us its also good for the country its good for the economy and of course will help us down the road but we reached the million financial inclusion actually three years ahead we set it for and weve been named the world sic worlds best bank for financial inclusion by euromoney and of course we continue to be a benchmark in the sector with woman representing of the groups board of directors we believe strongly that diversity is not just the right thing but leads to better business outcomes and better decisions so i would like to leave it here and then héctor will now go into more detail into the groups performance héctor grisi checa chief executive officer santander holdings usa inc thank you ana as you say no pressure so good morning to everyone lets go back into the income statement for a little bit as usual we are showing the growth rates both in euros and cost in euros okay as you can see banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 there was a positive impact from exchange rates from around to percentile points these are partially offset by fx hedge and the corporate center okay were including gains on financial transactions here as well in constant euros revenue grew at a faster pace than previous quarter as you can see and cost faced inflationary pressures but continued to increase below the rate of inflation thanks to this performance net operating income exceeded billion which is as the chair said a new record in loan loss provisions there are different forces impacting the ph yearend performance there were covid19related llps releases in an additional llps in relating mainly toward the macro assumptions and some of the normalization that we had had ill explain this later in much more detail this year also registered higher charges related to regulatory funds new resolution schemes and lower minority interest and tax burden  was impacted mainly by the deposit guarantee fund the bank levy charges of approximately million after tax and million because of the aml settlement we did with the uk authorities all in all its a record year in nii revenue preprovision profit and profit supported by our geographic business diversification as i said diversification is resilience during the year in all regions as you can see we increased volumes specifically deposits okay quite strongly and also revenue while we reduced cost in real terms and maintained our credit quality under control regarding profit and profitability south and north america ended with outstanding profitability levels there was a notable recovery in profit and rote in europe dcb with its strong presence in europe improved its profitability and profit showing the benefits of consistent execution of our strategy in cib and wealth management we also produced excellent performance with profit growth of and respectively in addition revenue growth in our payments businesses like pagonxt and cards increased at high double digits and above the target our diversification and scale are key to improving results and profitability as well as being essential for stability i will go now through the main pl items in much more detail as you can see in this chart starting with the quarterly trends in constant euros a strong revenue improvement quarteronquarter supported mainly by all regions and global businesses the last quarter of this year was billion higher than in  boosted mainly by nii billion exactly looking at  versus  in detail nii maintained a consistent upward trend  increased versus  mainly driven by europe mainly spain with a growth and another strong quarter in north america after record nii in  south america also rose due to argentina and brazil while chile continued to be impacted by the negative sensitivity to interest rate rises and the lower inflation as you can see also our net fee income continued to recover with positive trends mainly south america dcb and in the global businesses trading income increased last quarter driven mainly by the spain and the corporate center the fx hedge and as you can see in the chart as the chart has already mentioned this is in line with a very small portion of our total revenue finally other income decreased in  affected by deposit guarantee fund charges that i already explained and detailed moving on to the full year nii rose in constant euros nii rose in europe plus north america and south america at if we look at the main drivers of the nii and nim improvement we have a broadbased growth in loans and deposits loans were up on all regions low single digits in europe and high single digits in north america and dcb with double digits in south america banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 the global business has grown also of note cib plus likewise deposits also increased strongly in all the regions interest rate hikes mainly benefited the uk poland and mexico and are not yet fully reflected as you have seen in spain portugal and the us but brazil chile and dcb are still affected by the negative sensitivity to the interest rate rises the group net interest margin increased to from in the fiscal year is mainly supported by our cost of deposit management given that there was no economic benefit in maintaining most of our tltro positions following the changing conditions announced in october we were able to accelerate tltro repayments and have repaid billion to date mainly in banco santander which has repaid billion out of the billion in total that we had we expect this positive nii performance to continue in as we still have room for improvement as interest rate increases have not yet been fully passed in some of the countries we are also rebuilding our alco positions from their current low exposure mainly in spain and we are taking advantage of the higher yields by doing that the rise of interest rates would generate an increase in nii over a 12month period of around billion to billion considering the forward curves that we have in the interest on fee income we have positive performance in all regions europe is up north america and south america around dcb also up by this performance was supported mainly by greater activity in high value added products and services as you can see on the righthand side of the slide lets move on to cost the sharp increase in inflation led to an overall increase in cost however in real terms cost fell by as we continued to improve productivity and crossborder collaboration our efficiency ratio is one of the best in the sector we improved this year and we were able to end close to our target despite inflationary pressures and indiscernible some regions between its impact on cost almost which is almost automatic mainly in latin america and the uplift to revenue from higher interest rates which will continue to feed through the coming quarters structural changes in our operating model are driving new productivity gains an example of this is europe which have better efficiency ratio and where we have significantly reduced cost base over the last few years also we are working on transformation simplification and on reducing the cost to serve while maintaining service quality for example in spain the cost to serve per customer fell around turning to the risk performance llps grew yearonyear due to first covid19related provisions released in as i previously said the additional billion of macro provisions in mainly spain the us and the uk part of which indiscernible already considered brazil and poland and  was also impacted by the normalization that we had in the us and a oneoff that we had in cib in brazil in terms of cost of risk were not seeing significant deterioration we have improvements in brazil to and mexico normalization continued in the uk and the us from extremely low levels in and poland was impacted by the mortgages in brazil quarterly cost of risk peaked in the year in  having declined in  and  excluding the oneoff the full year also will have been in line with our previous estimate in summary in an uncertain environment we met our cost of risk target and we have taken measures over the last few years to improve the risk profile moreover there is no significant worsening of the variables that have the greatest impact on credit deterioration in the countries where we operate mainly unemployment banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 this performance was supported by a high quality of our portfolio the npl ratio was better yearonyear with improvements mainly in europe and dcb it fell basis points in spain yearonyear in part due to the portfolio sales we executed total loan loss reserves stood at around billion and portfolio distribution by stage remained mostly stable on the righthand side there is a brief overview of our loan portfolio structure of the total portfolio as you can see is secured mostly with real estate collateral of loans are mostly concentrated in mature markets in developing markets brazil accounts for just of the group total exposure and if you see it by segment our mortgages have low average ltvs the consumer lending portfolio is very well collateralized short term and has high returns the sme and corporate portfolio is covered with around warranties lastly twothirds of the cib portfolio is investment grade in other words a very high quality portfolio its important to address that the loan portfolio has a mediumlow risk profile and is very predictable the main economic variables that most affect our business are expected to remain resilient across along all the footprint this coupled with a group focus in recent years on balance sheet strength has allowed us to improve our credit risk profile and face the current environment with really great confidence lets look at the main countries in spain we have significantly reduced the average ltv of the mortgage portfolio is around our corporate portfolio improved its rating and the ico ico portfolio performed better than expected the macro environment also is better than previous than in previous crisis and employment as our chair said is more much more resilient in the uk of the portfolio is floating the simple average ltv for mortgages is around and less than of the portfolio has ltvs below new business vintage delinquency rates are stable and without any sign of deterioration and from a macro perspective the uk has a very low unemployment rate we are also very positive in brazil and the us as we are very well positioned to face the context of the normalization that weve been having lets go in detail to brazil okay we have as you can as you have seen a very different economic environment we have demonstrated first of all that our risk management capabilities are strong enough to face a very challenging scenario our cost of risk in brazil has remained below over the past seven years and on average closer to with greater stability than our local peers additionally during these last years and lately starting last quarter of we have taken a cautionary actions in order to improve the structure of the portfolio let me explain it in detail we have been very more selective in origination to increase exposure basically to lower risk collateralized portfolio like mortgages agro or payrolls as you can see in the graph on the bottom left side we have increased secured loans by weighting by more than percentage points we have also enhanced the profile of our customers the weight of the new vintages with best ratings has increased from to this has been reflected in 90day delinquency ratio which has improved from in the old vintages to in the new ones finally in the right side of the slide you can see what the cost of risk increase in the last two year was mainly driven by personal and auto loans portfolio which has recently improved very much in the trends all in all given our risk management the enhanced portfolio mix and the new lending profile we dont expect a deterioration of the cost of risk on a likeforlike basis in in brazil now lets go and focus on the us with regard to credit in performance was better than initially expected as you know much of santander us provisions come out of our auto businesses where the anticipated credit normalization began later than we would have thought but is now materializing while looking at the slide a key variable for performance will be loan loss provisions performance in auto credit here we see in detail first the normalization of credit performance will continue through throughout and increased cost of risk driven by two years of loan losses due to covid stimulus and the pandemic related factors number two the portfolio mix shift towards better quality the percentage of the prime ficos in banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 the loan portfolio has increased since from to the higher mix of prime loans implies better credit profile and decreases the cost of risk it is important to note the significant progress made in establishing a full spectrum auto business funded by our consumer deposits currently of the portfolio is retail funded versus in as the risk profile normalizes in the us european regulation is more demanding with regard to classification by stages thereby requiring greater provisions all combined we expect cost of risk to increase in but remain below prepandemic levels of in that we had in of in as the improved portfolio mix will support the asset quality now lets discuss capital we are very comfortable with our capital position we are in line with our target to be above and once again the numbers show the strength of our organic capital generation during the year there was basis points of gross organic generation of which basis points were assigned to shareholder remuneration this increase was partly offset by impacts from markets and models which have embedded a culture across organization that puts capital efficiency at the heart of all decisions and from key strategies at board level to the daytoday origination process as a result we have an enhanced portfolio management and increased our balance sheet rotation levers that have been implemented are securitization asset sales or risk transfer through credit protection and also use of guarantees the group return on riskweighted assets of was boosted by higher margins spend discipline and efficient capital deployment and front book return on riskweighted assets was with all regions meeting or improving their profitability targets rwas with positive indiscernible increased from to with key improvements in the company segments in spain the uk and the us mainly in thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea group executive chair banco santander sa thank you thank you very much héctor and let me now allow me to sum up before we go to the qa and just to briefly summarize our results for and our targets that we are setting for as i said was a year that again surprised us and was unexpected on many fronts we faced many things and i want to emphasize this out of our control but we did deliver with our focus on what we do control and the proven success of our strategy and business model and focus on execution enabled us to deliver these excellent results we continued to grow customers and met all our targets improve customer experience you can see this in the growth in revenues and profits we continued to improve our businesses and operating model and profitability as we invested for the future we continued to deliver strong risk performance and capital generation and again all of this is reflected in greater shareholder remuneration and value creation im not going to dwell on this but i just want to reiterate that when we set the medium term plans we were not counting with covid we were not counting with the war in europe and we have delivered in spite of that on every single one of our targets and almost delivered on efficiency in spite of the high inflation and this is really important because we have done this at a time at the same time as weve strengthened our business and operating model and our cultural transformation so again i want to stress that we have not just delivered in the medium term plan in we have set the foundations to allow us to grow profitably into the future and deliver for our shareholders increasing returns as we look ahead we are confident that all of this places us in a very unique situation visàvis our peers we are confident we can continue to increase profitability and that this will be done at the same time as we drive growth doubledigit revenue growth again supported by both greater activity and the change in our model more customers and also the higher interest rate environment we have significant tailwinds in europe with the current curve this is a significant amount over billion maybe héctor wants to give some more details later further banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 improvement in our efficiency ratio we do expect cost of risk to tick up during the year in part driven by the normalization of provisions in the us that héctor covered and you can see in the slide he shared again based on current economic consensus we are seeing the cost of risk remaining below in but very importantly we are confident that revenue growth will continue to outpace growth in provisions and costs and of course this is what leads us to a projection of and a guidance were giving on return on tangible equity above already in last but not least ive said it before i am absolutely and we are absolutely convinced that its our purpose and how we want to be different that its going to enable santander to deliver today and into the future this has been our guide since and its still our guide its part of our culture it defines how we do business and again will allow us to continue progressing together as a team we are here to help people and businesses prosper our aim is to be the best open financial services platform by acting responsibly and earning the lasting loyalty of our people customers shareholders and communities and this is what will drive future growth and customer loyalty increase profitability and drive greater shareholder remuneration and value creation so thank you so much begoña over to you or begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you ana i think we can open the floor for the questions question and answer section operator thank you everyone operator instructions and we already have our first question coming from francisco riquel from alantra please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes good morning thank you for taking my questions and congratulations for the results two for me first on cost of risk in brazil i wonder if you can comment the coverage ratio that you have now provision for the oneoff npl in cib that you mention and what is the calendar of provisions left for this single name in and in this context if you can give guidance on the cost of risk that we should expect for brazil with and without this oneoff just to assess the underlying trends in asset quality second in cost of risk is the us business youre guiding for a net chargeoff in below precovid levels other listed peers in consumer finance there in the us are already above precovid in so i wonder if you can reassure us why scusa will outperform in this cycle how much are internal reasons because of the de risking and how much is because you are more optimistic in the macro and interest rates and last question is on capital if you can please update on the regulatory headwinds left for thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa okay let me take that first and then héctor you might want to complement this so on brazil cost of risk first we do not comment on single customer names the provisions weve made in are we believe prudent and banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 follow both our internal and auditors guidance we believe were covered sufficiently for now whats important is that we are guiding for cost of risk for the group to be below and excluding the oneoff in we are expecting cost of risk in brazil to be stable i would let héctor maybe or josé in terms of coverage and other trends in brazil in the us and again i will pass over to héctor also but i just want to stress something which is really important since we have derisked our consumer business in the us we have worked together with the group and we have worked together with our retail bank so two very important data points is because thanks to this combination where we see our business in the us to be very different from our retail peers we are now at of our auto business being prime it was in thats one of the big reasons why yes we expect normalization but not to the previous levels by the way of our business in the us is now retail funded because we do have retail deposits and leveraging on oem relationships we won mitsubishi and others actually mitsubishi only in the us recently so this is really important and ph not an important point as in héctors slide you can see this is we sold the riskier portfolio we had in scusa which was bluestem weve done many more things to simplify the business the last few years but these are the two bigger points again i dont know if héctor would like to add something on capital our guidance is very clear we expect to continue to build capital i believe héctor mentioned we do not have any significant regulatory headwinds in but please comment on that again i think on capital whats important is we have been building capital for the last seven years we raised the big amount of capital when i arrived in we reached the level of capital of last year we said well be above every quarter we are now in line with peers and whats important weve shown again this year its less volatile than other peers so héctor or josé would you like to add on héctor on cost of risk in brazil anything else on coverage on the us héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer santander holdings usa inc cost of risk i mean in brazil in terms of brazil ana as you have said i mean its quite clear we have changed a little bit the mix what were doing we took the decisions where we needed to take them and i see it very stable and thats exactly the guidance were giving indiscernible and in terms of the coverage as we as i have said we have billion of overlays that we did both in the us and brazil to cover those so i will feel very comfortable with what we have done and with the amount of reserves and provisions that we have in both of them in terms of the us you have explained it perfectly well the change of mix basically changes the outlook of what we used to have before so we dont believe that the cost of risk is going to go back to levels and actually what we have seen is that trend is a little bit positive than we expected at the beginning and in terms of the capital i dont know josé do you like to comment but what i have seen is indiscernible josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa exactly we dont expect any significant supervisory charges in the charges in were very much in line with our expected basis points or so for the year as a whole in this quarter is where we had a impact of the new models mortgages spain and sme spain and again most models or all significant models have already banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 been updated so we dont expect any significant charges going forward and in terms of coverage provisions etcetera billion macro provisions we made in for the group as a whole we believe are sufficiently prudent to support the guidance of a cost of risk of below for next year begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you all can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from ignacio cerezo from ubs ignacio cerezo q analyst ubs ag london branch yeah hi good morning thank you for taking my questions the first one is on the us if you can give us a little bit of color on the difference in terms of loan yield and the cost of risk of the different fico buckets to get some flavor basically on how relevant that is that you have increased significantly the weight of fico above versus below so if you can give some numbers basically again to get a better reference on that and the second one is if you can clarify the tax rate youre using for your guidance in on a group basis and the third one is if you can update us on the basel iv impact youre expecting thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa ignacio i mean the fico yields on the portfolio as we say in spanish foreign language and maybe héctor can answer that but what i can tell you is that what really is important is that we have sold bluestem that was source of significant risk which we sold i have to say exactly at the right time second that independently of the margins which come up and down depending on competition clearly in prime or above is a very different risk profile and to be honest i mean i dont know héctor if you can add a bit more color on that in a few minutes in terms of the taxes in our effective tax rate was in we have still i think in well be somewhere around and in nominal taxes right nominal taxes were expected to change yes you will have this tax on revenues from spain which we estimate and we were instructed by our accountants and market authorities to put it in and i think thats million but thats not going to be seen at the tax level its going to be seen on the revenues but yes we are not expecting any change in nominal tax rates and the last one was on héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer santander holdings usa inc yeah basel iv ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa oh basel iv which may be héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer santander holdings usa inc banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 final implementation of basel iii we as you all know we still dont have the final proposal regulatory proposal we have had some positive news for us like the multiplying factor ilm equal to which was finally included as you all know also we are not affected by the output floor we are going to be affected by some other items like the operational risk but until the final legislation is written and approved its difficult to give an accurate estimate but what i can tell is that its not going to be significant and we should be able to build plenty of capital in the next two years to compensate for any impact that we may have ignacio sorry ignacio just very quickly in your first question okay i dont have the exact detail on the fico what youre saying but if you go to the page on the us on the presentation of the lefthand bottom side you can see there exactly whats the mix that we have no so you have the reds that are basically in the portfolio this is prime a near prime which is basically what we had done in changing the mix that we have and we couldnt have done that unless we had the funding from sbna that is basically now funding a big percentage on of the portfolio so this portfolio is mainly funded for that and ill i can give you later the details on that but thats basically the change of the mix that we have at this point so the risk is a lot less than we had before you can see how it has been growing and changes completely and is funded with our own deposit okay so its quite important to understand that begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you ignacio we will get back to you from ir with the yields on the fico dont worry can i have the next question please operator the next question is coming from ignacio ulargui bnp paribas exane ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas thanks thanks very much for taking my questions i have two questions one a bit more focused on costs if you looked at the if we looked at the performance of the bank in developed economies it has definitely been able to control inflation quite well it has not been that the case probably in latam just wanted to see if there is any kind of additional initiatives that you can push forward to control a bit more cost growth in the region and the second question its linked to the deposit franchises given your global footprint and the different experience that you have had in different interest rate cycles how do you see banks performing or behaving in terms of deposit betas i mean should we expect a material acceleration of deposit betas in europe or based on your latam experience do you think that that should be more controlled thanks ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa so let me just give a high level question and then maybe héctor you can help me here so in terms of cost control in latam let me just say that within the cost of risk sorry cost guidance were giving to we expect to be in the us were making structural changes we started this a year ago as you know were not able to change the model until months ago because of minorities and other issues so we believe that cost will be flat or down in the us again please confirm this for me in south america there will be stable were focused on cost control given the lingering effects of inflation we believe that that will be more or less flat you will see some increase in mexico again in europe we expect to have costs but again were giving cost to income guidance because of inflation and uncertainties there so banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 theres some space but as you saw spain for example costs came down around if i remember correctly it was for the whole group in the uk we had good cost control we expect that to continue going forward so it depends very much on the countries and in latam south america i believe is sort of flattish us is flat to down and mexico will be up but héctor you can help me here deposit franchises i mean this is important and we have grown deposits in many of our core markets including in the us this is really important we do believe increased competition but again here whats important is the net interest margin we expect that to expand not just because of the fact that were not paying a lot of our deposit franchises remember were retail were not paying retail franchises when rates were negative at some point yes we will start paying for deposits but were in a strong competitive inmarket position and we believe the structural changes in the model with better service and better digital capacity will help us to do better there so i dont know if you want to add anything there on the cost control in latam mexico us or other countries héctor héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer santander holdings usa inc yes just in cost control i mean as you can see i mean latin america is much more difficult given that people are used to it and a lot of it is indexed of what we do but we have been able to maintain it below inflation in most of the countries the important fact here and the important change of what we used to do is that were working together much more and we are developing a lot of our software together and decreasing the amount of risk that we are sorry the amount of expenses that we are generating in all of the countries as our chair has explained for example i mean the acquiring platform was developed by getnet and is being used in the rest of the countries also the important fact is that the way we are handling the different the different expenses is very much controlled and we have put implemented one of the main drivers that is basically all of what we do in infrastructure and were maintaining it to the minimum so in that regard we believe that were going to be able to control costs below inflation which is i believe the most important point and to maintain as we have said under the guidance that we have given in terms of the deposit franchise i can give you some of the beta deposits that we have in spain is around to the uk is around the us around and brazil is around its very automatic but what also we can tell you is that in the last quarter we have been able to also increase deposits in some of our most important markets take a look for example deposit growth in the us was mexico in the last quarter outpaced our competitors in that sense and we have been were going to be very much focused on that in the whole franchise and in the different parts of the bank to really enhance our deposit gathering business begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you ana and héctor can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc and good morning thanks for taking my questions apologize ive got a followup on us and one on or a new one on brazil on the us im looking at your charts on the righthand side on slide that you showed the delinquencies or early delinquencies my understanding is that the vintages of the second half and in particular the vintages of were the ones that deteriorated most indiscernible from competitors but it looks like youre showing an improvement so maybe you can comment on apart from the general banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 comments youve made specifically on the latest vintages is that whats giving you confidence or maybe some commentary there and within that guidance of the cost of risk in the us maybe you can share what the comp price assumption youre using for this year i know your competitors are expecting midteens reductions right but i dont know what youre factoring in that cost of risk and on brazil just some commentary maybe on the nii growth that we can look forward to this year its obviously been slow as you had already guided to in the second half of i dont know if with the latest sort of rate expectations should we expect only growth in the second half as you were saying before or any updates on the brazilian sort of dynamics thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa so yeah so thanks i will ill actually just give another high level apologies for that i think its important to put vintages and more specific questions in the us in the context of the country i think its really important to understand that our us business is fundamentally much stronger than it was three or four years ago including the consumer business its a business we understand we know how to manage were in control the cost of risk this year was better than guided the lease leases is what linked to car prices maybe thats lease sales that maybe héctor can address that but what is important is were very confident that we can deliver through thecycle returns in the us i also want to point out that in the last three four years actually to medium term plan the us was the country that added most value to the group in euros actually the combination and this is after all cost to tnav effects in euros for shareholders us and brazil were the top two delivering of the total shareholder value creation this is really important as you think about where we put our capital it has proven to be anticyclical because of the two extraordinary years we had in the us almost ph billion in dividends last year and more coming this year and weve looked at this business inside and out it delivers very good returns to shareholders way over the cost of equity through the cycle so again its important to put this in the context that its a business we know its a business we understand its a business that is leveraging the group that is leveraging the retail funding which were using to derisk and compete successfully with us banks in prime and near prime we won mitsubishi as i mentioned and hopefully more to come having said that héctor could you address the latest vintages please and the car prices in a minute brazil again as i said us and brazil the two countries that have generated of the value creation in euros after everything is assigned of the value creation in euros to shareholders in the to year plan brazil has a negative exposure i mean negative sensitivity to rising rates i believe this should reverse once rates stop going up in the second half of the year but again héctor maybe you want to add on the car prices manheim index and others héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer santander holdings usa inc sure look i dont know with that specificity exactly whats going on in the vintages but what i can tell you is what we have seen and the trend is that the new vintages are performing much better than expected and why is that because first of all we changed as we have said a little bit the mix but also the risk profile in the sense that we since we were very much focused in profitability in that regard the risk that we are seeing in those vintages is a little better because profitability was of the essence in what we did and we were very much focused on that and in profitability based on the model that we have is based on risk so in that sense what tells you is that we were very much focused on that and also as i told you before the trend is much better than we have seen and we could see that its going to perform better than it did in the past banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 in the second one we should see growth in brazil in the to for nii so in that sense well see that this going quite well we are being very cautious in brazil in the way we manage risk and in that sense as the chairman already said i mean we have negative sensitivity indiscernible rates but the growth of the portfolio basically offsets that so as you have seen i mean were going to continue expanding the nii in that sense begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you ana and héctor can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from marta sanchez romero from citi marta sanchez romero q analyst citi good morning thank you very much for taking my questions the first one is regarding your real estate exposure in spain would you say a restructuring is due and would it make sense to use some of your extra nii to clean up the second question is about the us top line it has been somewhat weak moving backwards your customer spread is moving backwards were seeing competition for deposits in the us so can you give us some color on what to expect for nii and fee growth in the us for and then last quick question whats the tax rate you expect in brazil for next year its been quite low this year at just yeah thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa so in terms of real estate in spain im going to need a bit of help here from héctor and josé but we are not expecting so our main exposure in spain today is nothing to do with what we had back in so the developers exposure is at very low levels remember that spain has not built many homes for the last years so one of the most resilient housing markets in europe or definitely in our core markets we expect it to be spain theres been a big deleveraging of families employment remains very high and at the end our real estate exposure is mostly in the individuals in mortgages and that is we expect it to be resilient and again as in the uk very much based on employment levels which will fall but from historic highs so in terms of restructurings in real estate theres nothing that is anything material that would affect our guidance or our performance in spain if you go back for example where were the earnings not just santander but as a sector in a big chunk of this was in real estate developers today that is id say minimal very small and we have restructured these these are listed companies that is a mark to market and its actually doing pretty well so there is nothing there that would cause any concern in terms of the numbers again in spain in terms of the us top line i think héctor has explained that but can give you more details go ahead héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer santander holdings usa inc banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 there is one important point marta that i think is important and i didnt say im sorry about that the important and the top line what youre saying youre right and the main problem is the leasing okay whats been happening in the market we used to get a lot of the cars back and we used to made a lot of money on the leases because the car prices and the manheim were up and we were making a lot of money and what happened is two situations first of all people saw the car prices used car prices went up so some of the people didnt exercise the lease option and basically eliminated a huge amount of the profit that we were making on that on the secondhand indiscernible there were no new cars so people basically exercised the lease option due to the fact that there were no new cars to get a new one so those two things hit us hard last year in terms of the top line because leasing is a great profit center in the us so those are the two particular things that hit us and thats why you look at the top line in a different way its not loan loss provisions its mainly the lack of revenue because of the leases okay so its quite important to understand that and just to give you a piece of detail in spain indiscernible i mean we dont have a huge amount of exposure in developments or anything like that its mainly billion to billion in around there in terms of commercial in mortgages okay that is individual mortgages and what is important to say is that of those mortgages are in floating rate and only on fixed rate okay so the portfolio will start resetting mainly in april through the end of the year begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from carlos cobo catena from société générale carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hi thank you for the presentation and good morning carlos from socgén one is on the alco book in spain if you could quantify how much of the increase in nii this quarter coming from the topup in the alco portfolio and what would be the existing size on the total target also if you have similar plans for the other continental europe balance sheet to grow the alco i think thats it i mean the other questions have been answered already if you could specify its not a big issue but the double digit growth in revenues the target for would that be in constant euros as well as as or that would be a nominal thank you héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer santander holdings usa inc yeah let me ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa sorry let me just one second yeah i let you josé and héctor but i just want to say on the alcos that the effect in  is minimal from the euro alco i think we explained in the past we had a very small position we have rebuilt some of that and ill let héctor and josé address that but theres another issue about the other alcos is that we have a much higher proportion than other peers in terms of the heldtocollect banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 much smaller sorry much smaller which means that this has hit our capital and our tnav this quarter but this should come back in the fall i have been more conservative in how we account for that in terms of the euro alco its still very small relative to a say neutral hedge position so there is space to continue building that but maybe you want to address that héctor or josé héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer santander holdings usa inc yeah very quickly at the end of the year we had billion more or less in euro alco weve been building that in the fourth quarter so as the chair said the impact of that in the nii in the quarter was really not significant our plans is to gradually build an alco reaching a neutral position not this year maybe in two or three years we know that we have very very low alco portfolio and we want to gradually and so as the chair said the impact of that in the nii in the quarter was really not significant our plans is to gradually build an alco and reaching a neutral position not this year maybe in two or three years we know that we have a very very low alco portfolio and we want to gradually increase the size of the alco portfolio we will do it not only buying spanish government bonds we want to have a diversified portfolio german italian french bonds as part of that portfolio going forward this is a significant difference relative to the way that we build our alco portfolios in the past ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa yes in terms of the doubledigit revenue growth that is in current in euros so we are guiding to doubledigit revenue growth in euros i think that was the other question that you asked yes let me just say just to expand on that i mean one of the reasons that our tnav hasnt grown as much as we believe it will grow in the future is that for the reason i said before so if you look at period of the value creation was from brazil and the us and im talking in euros after all the effects reason for that is of course that the us and brazil did really well but also that europe did not do as well and you are beginning to see that change in i was just checking numbers and please take this with a grain of salt i know begoña will say and others but if you look at santander made about million in bannister and somewhere around billion it was a different criteria but just for orders of magnitude billion close to billion in the santander network in spain is back to billion i know conditions are very different and everything and of course that how we delivered those profits a big chunk of that was with real estate developers today that is minimal to the previous question so there is a big opportunity to continue improving not just in spain as i said but also in europe and thats why were guiding to doubledigit revenue growth and again as youve seen this year the big delta will continue to be in europe for different reasons operating performance as well as the tailwinds and interest rates begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 operator the next question is coming from ph benjamin thomas from rbc capital markets q good morning thank you for taking my questions firstly on loan growth in the uk it feels like the mortgage market is about to go through a very sharp downturn can you give us some guidance on loan growth that you expect in the uk for and then secondly on swiss franc mortgage component can you just update us on the assumptions youre listing for the provision there please and how those assumptions compare to peers thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa so i will let héctor with the swiss franc but just on the uk its a market that im very familiar with were expecting to improve profitability in we are focusing more on margins than volumes because there is a very competitive and challenging environment our cost of risk is minimal right now we come out i believe if not i think the best on stress test until we have a lot of focus on quality of the portfolio with a loantovalue and it is important as i said before the macro context unemployment and this is the key one for us in terms of how we will perform not just net interest income and revenues but also overall profitability including in the uk so i dont know if by the way the uk is the only country where as you know both the imf but also in our numbers we are expecting a recession a negative growth for the whole of okay but again unemployment even if it so gdp contracting i think our numbers are but from very low levels so we are monitoring very carefully our portfolio again the return on mortgages is still very attractive above the cost of equity and i dont know if you want to complement that héctor and address please if you can the swiss franc mortgage question héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer santander holdings usa inc swiss francs we increased the coverage of the swiss franc portfolio to over at the end of last year of around which is very much in line with the figures that we have for our competitors at the end of the third quarter probably we are basing that on our experience of the recent court rulings locally so its important to stress that we are already above the knf recommended level in poland so we feel comfortable with that level and again we will be assigning provisions to this portfolio in the future based on the experience of court rulings we are as you know still expecting a very important ruling from the european court of justice particularly related to the capital returns so again this is a very fluid situation future provisions again will be assigned depending on court rulings locally ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 operator we have a question coming from andrea filtri from mediobanca andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom yes thank you could you please provide more geographical visibility for the main countries behind the double digit revenue growth for and we got that this target is in euros the question before was if its constant euros or if it is adjusted for the future fx the second question is on your billion to billion rate sensitivity can you please elaborate the assumptions behind that ie which forward curve are you using and what date and what are the possibilities are you assuming in each country for your guidance and just finally if you could give us the detail of the structural hedge on the uk portfolio thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa yes please let me just correct something in terms of revenues i said current euro its in constant the double digit revenue growth in terms of the but it is the same right we also yeah were guiding actually both should increase both constant and also current the billion to billion rate sensitivity thats based on the current forward curves i mean i think that was the day we did the presentation but my team can and the ir can give you more detail on that one in terms of deposit betas actually héctor went through that in another question maybe you want to repeat it the deposit betas ill leave you go through that again but he answered that and in terms of geographic visibility and guidance well give detail on that in investor day but i do want to stress one thing this is not just about geographies this is also about the global businesses and the santander network which has been one of the key advances weve made in the last few years and theres a lot more opportunity to leverage these global businesses as were already doing and showing with cib wealth management and payments and auto to a lesser extent so we will give you more visibility how this benefits the individual geographies in the coming investor day i think i answered ph both questions and maybe you want to repeat the deposit betas and then maybe josé héctor grisi checa a chief executive officer santander holdings usa inc yeah the betas as i said are to in spain in uk around in the us around and brazil around and as you know very automatic due to the fact that its indexed josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah so the way weve done the interest rate sensitivity is on the static balance sheet at the end of december running the forward rates on the 31st of december for each currency with the betas that héctor just mentioned so no assumption on volume growth or repricing so when you look at our doubledigit revenue growth double digit revenue growth for next year means roughly billion increase in revenues and what we are saying is that between billion to billion of that will come just from interest rate sensitivity most of which is in euros banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 obviously so the structural hedge in the uk which was the final question its pretty stable at around billion its billion more or less structural hedge in the uk begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from daragh quinn from kbw daragh quinn q analyst kbw hi thank you for taking my questions just a followup question on brazil and the outlook for the cost of risk in and i think you said that you expect it to be stable is that relative to the actual number reported in the or the underlying one at which excludes the oneoff that we saw in  and then a second question on spain and the outlook for nii maybe just if you can give us some sense of what kind of magnitude of nii growth youre expecting for next year and to what extent do you think that nii growth maybe not just for you but for the industry as a whole in spain will generate more political risk in this year of elections and then finally sorry just a quick question on the european consumer finance or the digital consumer bank its probably one of the unique businesses in the group which relies more on wholesale funding or group funding maybe just if you could give a comment on your outlook for how that funding will reprice in and the impact you see on margin for that business now over the next months thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa okay so the first one is easy its excluding the oneoff so excluding the oneoff so around is the number that we published thats the stability so roughly stable were not saying a number im saying roughly stable excluding the oneoff investor day probably well give a more detailed guidance or not we have to decide exactly how much we give i just want to go back to the group because again what santander offers is a group its not just a specific country and i think what matters is that we delivered less than cost of risk in spite of oneoff in spite of inflation in spite of things being very different please this is exactly the work we have been doing and we are increasing and héctor is fully focused on how can we combine this unique global scale with inmarket scale so that santander as a whole makes more money is more profitable and creates more value so but again is the roughly stability net interest income in spain again details will be given in investor day but i do want to reiterate what i said before were still below the levels way below the levels again very different market but a much better quality of earnings today than what we had before spain is growing the number of customers spain is gaining market share in deposits i think héctor mentioned that i think around last year spain has grown ph new customers last year banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 so what youre seeing in spain is a combination of very important a change in the model already and we will tell you more about where that is going in the next few years and also the tailwind in interest rates and as the cfo explained a very conservative alco in euros which of course mainly benefits spain dcb that one i know well so dcb is obviously like our consumer business in the us these are businesses that are more hard hit by higher rates in spite of that weve actually improved our return on tangible equity to we as you know joined up dcb with openbank so we have now a digital bank helping to fund our business in dcb with very good growth in deposits and by the way very cheap deposits so if i remember correctly the billion billion of openbank is at around basis points costs so that is helping in terms of cost of risk and i can say that so if you look at so were seeing a normalization of cost of risk with all the caveats and less risky portfolio and so on that héctor explained in the us were seeing a normalization again in the uk from very very low levels and we will some normalization in dcb and all of that is included within the less than cost of risk you know more details to come i think any josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah just a couple of things on nii spain the as i said the billion to billion is mostly in euros and to a great extent in spain and quarteronquarter fourth quarter over third quarter nii in spain was up so i think you can have a pretty good idea what nii is expected to do in next year in spain funding in dcb dcb has around a third of its balance sheet funded with deposits as interest rates go up that offers a great opportunity to improve the funding structure of dcb and we have plans to grow deposits at dcb in germany and in some other countries but mostly in germany over the next couple of years by a significant amount so this should help keep our spreads in dcb at very attractive levels begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you we have around minutes remaining on the call so lets try and make this brief next question comes from sofie peterzens sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi sofie from jpmorgan sorry to go back to the brazil asset quality but if i look at your npl ratio in brazil its now over but also coverage in brazil has weakened quite significantly in the past year ph with high over now its below im just wondering yes and then in addition you have unsecured why do you feel comfortable with coverage in brazil shouldnt it be closer to and also considering that you have unsecured lending in brazil is it fair and most of these loans deemed to have been originated when rates were in the lowsingle digit range isnt it fair to assume that npls probably will continue to trend up in brazil and if not why not and then my second question would be on the hedging policy could you just remind us how much of your fx is hedged and how much is it costing santander per year to hedge the pl and the capital thank you ana patricia botínsanz de sautuola oshea a group executive chair banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 02feb2023 so were very comfortable with our provisions in brazil let me remind you that provisions are now forward looking weve made a macro overlay for the whole group that a lot of our portfolio in brazil is secure and its actually really resilient weve seen the deterioration already and is more than enough again we follow ifrs which are now very much forwardlooking provisions so the provisions doesnt mean that that is the cost of risk provisions is the expected cost of risk we had a big discussion if we should not change the cost of the risk to expected cost of risk because of the way the accounting now is very forwardlooking so were very comfortable with our provisions in brazil for the existing risk let me also say that our cost of risk in brazil has been and over the last seven years that includes three years with almost decrease in gdp today brazil were expecting growth in the gdp next year employment to be very resilient so were actually quite confident that both brazil and mexico will grow more youve seen that in the recent imf unemployment levels in both countries have been very resilient again thats one of the main factors yeah in the final ph loss of the cost of risk in fx we cover josé or héctor josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah as you know we have basically the following strategy so we hedge the capital ratio the of using group risk weighted asset crr calculation so what is at we dont hedge the hedge is done at forward rates so for tnav impact which is what i guess youre asking the question sofie is indifferent how much we hedge because for tnav impact to predict and tnav impact you just take the equity invested in noneuro countries and apply forward rates on a yearly basis and by doing that you can estimate the impact on tnav because again we hedge the excess over at forward rates and obviously we have tactically hedges for our pl but those flow through pl so when we hedge expected profits those hedges come through the pl begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa
