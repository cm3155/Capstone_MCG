going to im going to start with the first quarter results starting with the activity levels of the group in the quarter where we continue to have a good customer activity customer and building activity we keep growing the customer base million more customers in the quarter million more since march this is reflect our growing business and an increased customer satisfaction as you know this is one of our goals and we rank in the top three in nps in markets now while the transactionality and the digital adoption keep growing a good base million almost million digital customers million more than in march and transactions in digital channels are growing at and that the digital opportunities has gotten a good pace as a result of this our volumes in the balance sheet be in loans and deposits kept growing both quarteron quarter and yearonyear and we translate this into a customer revenue growth that youre going to see in our pl so going to the performance results and profitability the  attributable profit was billion billion versus first q and underlying profit on yearonyear when we compare with the attributable profit remember that last year we print around million restructuring costs that we dont have this year on the cost side and this is particularly important in this unexpected high inflationary environment we were able to the cost to remain well below inflation and allow us to improve our efficiency ratio in line with our guidance of getting we improve our profitability ratios quarteronquarter yearonyear our return on tangible equity went to and eps growing at compared with  we continue to create value for shareholders the tangible net asset value per share stood at up quarteronquarter and up yearonyear including the cash dividends when we go to the balance sheet and we look at the risk particularly credit risk the cost of credit remains relatively stable at and below our guidance for the whole year and npl ratio stays at remember that in the quarter we have likeforlike basis without these ph nearly finishing up before the npl ratio fell like basis points or something like that banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 the core equity tier was above while good organic capital generation basis points from  earnings and minus basis points from dividend accrual on the second buyback share buyback that is going on and started midmarch so going to our pl let me say that remark that the churn rates play in a positive way ph or percentage points you have in the third and fourth column in the slide in current euros and constant euros is current euros is ph or percentage points or more partially offset by hedging in the corporate centre that our cfo will elaborate later on that we have a negative in due to the hedging of the expected profits as i mentioned earlier we are a net profit of more than billion growing strongly yearonyear in the quarter attributable our underlying profit recorded the same amount and we had no extraordinary charges i will elaborate in the different lines on the pl later on when we look at the regions we see that well we are around in each of the main regions europe north america and south america and the retail consumer bank around the well in addition to the revenues and profit also received indiscernible from costs growing below average inflation we will see later on control loan loss provisions and lower minority interest following the acquisition mainly of the santander consumer us minorities the quarterly indiscernible reflects our sustained profit growth quarter after quarter bucket but what i mentioned customer revenue growth the quarter comparison of nii is affected indiscernible so on a likeforlike basis we are growing to in constant euros nii qonq fee income continue to increase positive performance in the majority of the countries partially offset by seasonality in south america mainly in brazil cost increased quarteronquarter thanks to our cost discipline and partly due to bonus adjustment at the end of in the fourth quarter of in addition loan loss provisions remained flat yearonyear and up quarteron quarter driven by the provision released in the fourth quarter of circa million trends in euros were better as i said than in constant euros as ph growth rates were higher benefiting from the positive fx impact in the quarter so when we go in deep into the revenue revenues were north of billion net interest income and fee income accounted of total income by line nii grew in constant euro due to greater volumes and higher interest rates by country and at constant exchange rates significant rises were recorded in uk plus poland plus brazil mexico and on the other hand spain was affected by the changes of mix and lower alco portfolio and portugal by alco portfolio disposals that we executed in  net fee income amounted to billion plus in cost in constant euros driven by improved activity notably in high value added products and services you have the figures in the slide in great good levels of activity in cars insurance premiums pos turnover mutual and pension all the fees all across the board significant increase in activity levels that translated into higher fees in costs as i mentioned at the beginning while working in a high inflationary environment we are focusing here in two main points one is to make sure that our costs grow less than inflation this is the minus in real terms that we achieved thats particularly important and the second one is to keep improving our efficiency that improved ph going to the as you know this is one of our key targets when we go by banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 regions we are delivering i suspect according to our plans in europe in a much more difficult environment yeah so its true that we are showing here with the different reporting in europe but we are not far away i think the cfo already guide you that the billion cost savings are going to be more in the region of million affected by inflation but we are progressing very well in both in spain portugal and uk and also in poland in a high inflationary environment and we continue to deliver according to our plans affected somehow by inflation in non personal expenses that are much more difficult to control in north america growing well below inflation north america us and mexico ph minus that is a good achievement youve seen the results of our other players in the same markets where cost control has been difficult to achieve and in south america well the figure since pretty high argentina is there but also in brazil where the inflation is running above and there ph have been good with unions in brazil that the sector signing september last year was in the region of and translate into significant higher costs in line a bit higher than inflation i do expect in brazil to enter into two quarters of having the expenses growing less than they grew in the last two quarters on the back of our efficiency plans and digital consumer bank that is growing above inflation due to the some initiatives and change in perimeter last year the cost of credit well the credit quality indicators remain stable no significant impact from the war in ukraine we have no exposure to ukraine or russia as you already know our cost of credit basis points if you look at the only the last three month is basis points as you can see later in the country review that provisions normalize after releases in  the npl ratio basis points come from the new definition of default otherwise the npl ratio in a like forlike basis would be the loan reserves and the coverage remains relatively stable in coming quarters the implications of the impact of the current geopolitical situation and our business performance and credit quality are still relatively uncertain and we dont know the extent of the duration of the conflict however i should say that our starting point is very solid so the group diversification enable us the resiliency to face the crisis i mentioned that our exposure to the parts in the conflict is negligible we have enough tools in our hands to make us confident that we will meet our expected indiscernible cost of risk of below in even in the new scenario when it comes to capital our capital ratio we deliver we had a very good organic capital generation gross organic capital generation in the quarter was basis points on the back of the good results i just present to you basis points when to the shareholder remuneration basis points for the share buyback and basis point for the accrual of our payout policy thats basically and the other impacts are relatively minor regulatory models and markets and overall activity minor effect in coming quarters we will maintain our clear focus on of the implementation of disciplined capital allocation measures across the group and the achievement of the targets we announced in  in this regard well risk weighted assets are growing below loan growth our front book is already delivering high riskadjusted return we generate a rorwa of in  the presentation of risk weighted assets that do not cover the cost of equity keeps falling and this is a good sign of our future profitability banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 well our policy to remunerate the shareholders and the dividends the billion dividends split in in cash dividend and share buybacks the second share buyback program with a maximum of million started on march and we are is under execution as we speak as a result the total shareholder remuneration is billion ph due in our policy dividend policy that was stated by the board and we reiterate in our agm when we look at the capital the profitability ratios you can see in the slide both eps return on tangible equity tangible net asset value per share going in the right direction on the back of excellent capacity of the bank to generate results on a recurring and sustainable basis finally before i hand to josé i would like to highlight santanders strong commitments to esg you have in the slide our commitments and how are we progressing in the different communities that we have been in green finance where we already originate billion since our commitment is billion by we continue to seek good demand and there is significant investment going in this field and we are participating on this we are developing green products at the same time we are developing starting to develop an information system that allows us to track how our portfolio behaves in relation with co2 emissions and this is an important tool that we need to implement in order to track all our progress here well in the asset management industry we have also targets you have the figures in the screen in renewable energy we are world leaders and we are signing alliances in order to make progress in this field the decarbonization targets you have there our commitments both in the mainly related with the power sector and while we are progressing in line with our targets these goals are included in the executives longterm incentive scorecard that show how committed we are with these esg targets particularly i was referring here in the screen today but you know that we are also very active in the social particularly in the social target particularly in the microcredit space in latin america so i hand over to josé that continues the presentation with the results by regions and global businesses josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and good morning everyone as usual i will start with a brief summary of the regions and then i will move on to the countries to discuss in a bit more detail we continue to leverage the one of the strengths of our model which is diversification and scale improving the operating performance in all three regions and global businesses in europe we are making significant progress in the transformation of our business and in developing a common operating model we achieved doubledigit growth in net operating income and profit reaching a return on tangible equity in north america we are refocusing our position in the us while maintaining a disciplined capital allocation we accelerated growth and volumes generated a return on tangible equity of south america we are growing the number of customers and capturing new business opportunities delivering almost return on equity and in the digital consumer bank new lending increased by and profits rose doubledigits with a return on tangible equity of almost obviously we achieved all of these while enhancing our global business and connectivity with the regions in this way scib consumer sorry corporate investment bank and a return on banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 tangible equity of and wealth management insurance return on tangible equity was we continue to make progress in the development of pagonxt well talk about that in a minute maintaining high profitability in our card business with a return on tangible equity around so moving to europe the business transformation to develop is simpler and a common operating model is delivering good results with increased volumes especially in individuals mortgages were up consumer lending was up mutual funds up we experienced significant improvements in customer satisfaction surveys at the same time profit reached billion in the quarter increasing yearonyear revenue grew strongly nii was up supported by higher volumes and interest rate hikes in poland and in the uk fee income grew backed by greater activity our efficiency plans continue to bear fruit as the cost base shrunk went down in real terms and the efficiency ratio improved to around driving net operating income up by loan loss provisions dropped as the cost of credit started to normalize across countries most notably in spain return on tangible equity reached as i mentioned before up percentage points yearonyear all in all we remain on track to meet our targets for the year our performance in europe stood out not only for these positive set of results but also for the special initiatives implemented to support our ukrainian customers and employees as well as refugees and all those affected by the war in this regard we provided financial measures to facilitate transfers and cash withdrawals made donations and collaborated with ngos to help refugees such as the two planes chartered from warsaw to portugal and spain going into details in spain and in the uk in spain we increased the customer base by customers in the first quarter which obviously helped volumes especially new mortgage lending which doubled compared with the first quarter of and exceeded prepandemic levels in consumer credit profit grew yearonyear supported by the execution of our efficiency plans and the lower cost of credit revenue remained under pressure due to alco sales in and the change in mix we had a much better performance in fee income the quarteronquarter comparison is benefited from obviously the deposit guarantee fund charges of the fourth quarter but also supported by lower cost and loan loss provisions in the uk we maintained very positive business dynamics gross mortgage lending rose to billion in the first quarter near a record level nii rose supported by increased volumes and higher interest rates which drove doubledigit growth in revenue fee income its the comparison in fee income is negatively affected by the transfer of the corporate investment bank activity from the bank to the london branch we double our efforts to keep costs under control and thus improved efficiency by percentage points which enabled net operating income to grow loan loss provisions were higher following the cost the normalization of the cost of credit we would expect cost of credit to be around basis points and quarteronquarter comparison was affected by the loan loss provision releases in the fourth quarter moving to north america our strategy there is to accelerate profitable growth in the us while creating a joint value proposition to improve customer experience simplifying our business to generate efficiencies the acquisition of santander consumer us sic santander consumer usa outstanding shares along with amherst pierpont securities and crédit agricoles latam wealth management operations will improve our strategic focus and competitive position we had solid growth in individuals and commercial loans in mexico and increases in auto and cib in the us banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 on a likeforlike basis we need to exclude bluestem portfolio disposal in the first half of profit was higher benefiting from a better nii and the acquisition of minorities in scusa in the quarter we virtually doubled the average profit recorded before the covid19 pandemic in the us we continue to make progress toward simplifying our business model across our four core businesses consumer commercial cib and wealth management loans grew backed by cib auto and wealth management during the period auto originations decreased impacted by the semiconductor shortage pushing the manheim value index to an alltime highs in early customer funds continue to exhibit strong performance while the overall cost of funds decreased moving to the pl on a likeforlike basis profits dropped basically due to higher loan loss provisions driven by normalization in the cost of credit we also had a more normalized leasing activity due to an increase in the share of leaseend vehicles repurchased at the dealership in this quarter in the first quarter of were purchased relative to in the first quarter of nii was pressured by the runoff in paycheck protection programrelated balances all in all we recorded a very high level of profit more than doubling the quarter average profit in in mexico we had an excellent quarter reflecting our successful customer attraction strategy we delivered a yearonyear increase in profit and also great returns great profitability due to the increase in revenue supported by nii both due to higher volumes and the rise in interest rates and higher net income we also had lower loan loss provisions due to positive performance in our portfolio in south america we continue to focus on attracting new customers leveraging business opportunities strengthening connectivity and synergies across the region we recorded overall growth in loans with good dynamics in individual lending in most countries deposits rose driven by both demand and time deposits in terms of results we grew profits yearonyear with doubledigit customer revenue growth costs heavily affected by inflation especially in brazil and argentina although cost total costs were virtually flat in real terms higher provisions mainly driven by growth in individuals also in brazil we had lower taxes moving to brazil we maintained positive trends in customer acquisition customer increased yearonyear and digital customers grew yearonyear as we launched several initiatives for our multichannel strategy in volumes mortgages rose double digits card turnover was up and we maintained our leadership in auto this great customer activity enable us to absorb the rising costs and higher provisions due to the growth we had in individuals cost of risk stood at in chile we continued to expand santander life superdigital and getnet were very active in launching new strategic initiatives and as a result we had very strong customer attraction with growth yearonyear and we maintain our top position in nps and we grew the balance sheet both in loans and deposits in the pl very positive performance yearonyear up with revenues up cost growing below inflation and a lower cost of credit in the digital consumer bank also a solid quarter which reinforced our position we are gaining market share very quickly in europe and we also signed new strategic alliances with stellantis or piaggio we launched new leasing businesses in all our markets in which experienced the growth in new contracts yearonyear we launched the subscriptions we signed an agreement with wabi in subscriptions and we launched zinia our buy now pay later solution in germany which has generated over million new contracts in just months banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 moreover new business activity is now above precovid levels having increased yearonyear up in new cars and in used cars we are increasing market share as i mentioned in both markets new and used cars openbank continue to grow strongly both in balance sheet terms and number of customers and obviously this greater activity was reflected in fee income and lease and revenue growth costs were up due to investment in global transformation platforms and some inorganic transactions excluding these cost increased more or less minus in real terms we also had very positive trends in credit quality with a further basis points reduction in the cost of credit so overall again very excellent results very good results in the quarter by the digital consumer bank which increased turning to our global businesses in corporate investment bank our goal is to become one of the leading investment banks in europe consolidating our leadership in latin america and continue to accelerate growth in the us additionally as leaders within the sustainable sphere we completed in april our plan to acquire of waycarbon a leading brazilbased esg consultancy firm in terms of financial performance  was the best quarter in cib history with record revenue attributable profit and return on riskweighted assets revenue was up yearonyear a very good quarter relative to already a very good which led to a increase in profit it is worth noting that only of our revenue come from marketrelated activities comes from customers in wealth management despite market volatility our businesses grew thanks to our globallydiversified value added proposition and sales through digital channels we were named as one of the top global private banks by euromoney and activity levels remained strong with net new money around billion in the quarter investment flows and asset valuations were less impacted than in previous crises due to our global and high valueoriented asset mix contribution to the group rose in insurance we had sustainable growth based on nonrelated business in addition to strong growth in digital sales which were up yearonyear in summary higher revenue and total contribution to the groups profit in wealth management insurance achieved a growth up on a likeforlike basis turning to pagonxt in the first quarter we had several achievements in merchant acquiring getnet continue to deliver very high growth increasing total payments volume by backed by brazil one of our main growth drivers and spain thanks to our customer acquisition strategy and increased merchant activity and also mexico in international trade our one trade platform currently connects our customers in eight countries we continue to expand its capabilities to provide international instant payments between spain and brazil we plan to launch realtime payments in other international corridors in the coming quarters in summary revenue doubled yearon year in the quarter obviously quarteronquarter is affected by seasonality in cards i would like to highlight our efforts to improve our global card services we are working to globally manage million cards through the group throughout the group in the first quarter of we continue to grow strongly turnover and the number of transactions increased well above this performance was also reflected in the first quarter revenue which reached almost billion higher yearonyear we had positive performance in both credit debit cards and across regions it is worth mentioning that revenue in the fourth quarter is seasonally higher although in the fourth quarter we had black friday and christmas and still you see a very good comparison quarteronquarter which shows how banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 strong the first quarter of was looking forward we expect to continue to grow the number of accounts turnover and revenue now let me finish with the corporate centre we reported an attributable loss of million which is relatively high affected by the negative fx hedging results which obviously were more than offset by the positive performance of exchange rates in the countries results the quarter was also impacted by the higher liquidity buffer and we also recorded a negative tax impact due to the higher results of those businesses operating in spain on the other hand we recorded no material changes in costs and we had a significant decrease in loan loss provisions and other provisions and now let me turn it back to the ceo for his final remarks josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa thank you josé just to finish this presentation and before we go to the question let me share with you the outlook for the coming quarters taking into account the situation in which we are developing our business as a result of the geopolitical situation we are facing an environment in which we the consensus is shifting towards an environment of lower growth than otherwise will be the case as a result of this war and in a i mentioned before in a high inflationary environment that is triggering the reaction of the central banks increasing in the rates in some countries and some others the market is expecting those to be increased so taking into account all of these i should say a couple of things our starting point is extremely solid you see the results you see the trends and our activity in the business you see our customer gathering so the starting point is very solid and we face this environment from a strong position so our capacity to attract the customers and growing more profitable business in a high higher interest rate scenario is going to provide a big significant uplift to our revenues naturally in this inflationary environment we need to be as always looking at matching the cost we think that we can continue to deliver a cost growth well below inflation as we showed you in the first quarter third our capacity to control the cost of risk and to keep it below the average across the cycle based on our customer knowledge and our anticipation in some markets as we are doing in some markets make me comfortable with the guidance we gave to you in the cost of risk and our capital allocation strategy should continue to drive profitability improvement and maximize shareholder returns this make us confident we shared with you in our agm that we are in the right track to achieve our targets that we shared with you both in revenues efficiency return on tangible equity and capital so now we leave it here and we remain at your disposals for the questions you may have thank you begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and josé we can now start the qa session please banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 question and answer section operator everyone your questionandanswer session will now begin operator instructions and our first question is coming from ignacio cerezo from ubs you are now live ignacio cerezo q analyst ubs ag london branch yeah hi two things from me the first one is on brazil it looks like the situation has kind of deteriorated versus the guidance you gave back in december probably most of the lines are probably below expectations then so if you can update how youre expecting basically to be shaping up on the main lines in brazil and the second one is any information you can provide on the process of banamex in mexico interest timing any information actually incremental information versus the one you shared a few months ago thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay thank you ignacio for your questions let me to elaborate in brazil i should say first that our expectations are not materially different than the ones we had in the last quarter let me to share with you where are we in brazil so as you know we tightened our credit standards back in september last year as a result we are growing our portfolio less but we for the whole year i feel comfortable growing the portfolio in line with the inflation so more or less in line with inflation in the country so around a bit less a bit more so this is our expectation our there is significant customer spread expansion in the business so the spread customer spread went up more than basis points its true that on the other side this was more than offset by the alco positions that well on the back of increasing rates almost full percentage points naturally the nii and the nim coming from alco positions collapsed and this is what you see the combination of this is what you see in the nii so on revenuewise on the net interest income i feel that we can grow high single digits no problems to get there and the same can be say even more optimistic on fee income that we can be for the whole year in double digit the quarter show some seasonality here the costs have been difficult to control costs as i mentioned the agreement with the unions back in september increased the salaries and what we are showing the pl exactly this probably in the second third quarter were going to this is going to trend down the cost growth and we will see the agreement with the unions in september but i feel that we going to be able to match to get around inflation for the whole year finally you see going through pl you see in the quarter an increase in the cost of risk that we were anticipating and while we went from or a figure like that to something ph above i remain confident that were going to match to be in the range between for the whole year yeah so thats my view this indiscernible environment in which were going to continue to deliver good results from brazil and growing probably nicely in the country and having a return on tangible equity north of or around and not particular deterioration in this regard in this i should say more complex environment although i should say also that the war in ph ukrainia well when i look at brazil should be neutral to positive for brazil so im not as pessimistic as you seem to be about the trends in brazil yeah banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 so on second question banamex well indiscernible yeah to this yeah so we said we our chairman said the conditions our requirements for participating well we will not participate in the analysis of the deal you know our conditions but nothing i cannot at this time because were having we dont have additional information other than the one that is public information and the process has not officially started as far as i know begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you ignacio can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from sofie peterzens you are now live sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thank you here is sofie from jpmorgan so my first question would be if you could just kind of remind us of your auto partner agreements how should we think about the chrysler fiat sic fiat chrysler agreement that comes to an end next year and could you just remind us what your new agreements in the us are you also have some new agreements in the in europe so could you just remind us what the potential impacts from these agreements in europe are and related to that if you could also talk about the us cost of risk because it remains very low below basis points so how should we think about a normalized cost of risk level in the us and when do you expect loan losses in the us to normalize and then my second question would go back to brazil in terms of asset quality were starting to see some signs of kind of higher cost of risk but also higher npl ratios in in brazil and npl was and at the same time coverage fell to so how should we think about the asset quality outlook in brazil how concerned are you about the potential credit bubble given that rates have gone up so much thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay thank you sofie for your questions the first one related with stellantis our agreement with stellantis as you know first thing i should say we have an excellent relationship with stellantis and we reached an agreement in europe very satisfactory agreement i should say for us as a result of this agreement were going to focus in the main markets of stellantis in europe france italy and spain as a result of the agreement our portfolio with stellantis in europe is going to grow i dont remember exactly the number a couple of billions billion billion the total portfolio is billion or billionsomething were going to have extra billion billion as a result of this agreement that we reached with them europe when it comes to the us as you know stellantis chrysler bought an small finance company and they plan to develop this company while this company is fairly small as a result of this were going to continue to be the preferred provider ph for a while how long it will last depends on the how fast the other company evolves having said that we feel that were going to continue to underwrite significant having significant originations on chrysler stellantis in the us as long as with other originators we reached an agreement with mitsubishi well become the provider of mitsubishi we have agreements with certain dealers with certain originators in the online space and i do feel comfortable in the that were going to continue to have the core traditional core subprime banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 business we underwrite in our own in the near prime and prime space i think that the origination level is going to remain relatively stable at least in the us provider the car market evolves in a recovers the activity levels so im pleased with the developments in this front and the agreements with stellantis chrysler you mentioned the cost of risk in us and europe its true that in europe on the back of very low unemployment levels the cost of risk good price of the used car in the used car markets the cost of risk is at the one of the lowest levels we are not seeing any particular development here so if i i will focus more on the main kpi here is to me is unemployment rate yeah so as long as unemployment rate remains as low as it is today and the trends in the labor markets solid i feel comfortable with the current cost of risk and even can stay here or even go lower on the back of this in the us its different in the us we are going back to more normalized level you see in the trends and this trend will continue to go on josé already refers to the special situation of the used car markets in the us that has changed a little bit the dynamics in the sense that when the leases expire the lessors prefer to keep the car instead of giving us back and selling us to the market and this has changed a bit the dynamics in our pl at the the other income in the pl thats reduced as a result of not making gains in disposal of the leases just because the lessors prefer to keep the cars and dispose by themselves but the cost of risk is going to get more normalized over time brazil you elaborate i already to the previous ignacios questions i elaborate on the cost of risk you mentioned higher npl ratios the coverage ph forward outlook and the potential well i said that my best guess now based on the information i got is to have a cost of risk in the region of to yeah so probably two or quarters more three quarters more before we come back but this is my best estimation here well this is the result of as you rightly pointed out of a significant decrease in the disposable income combined with higher rates nothing that we were not expecting and that advised us to reduce our ph speed in the consumer lending in the fourth quarter last year and in the first quarter we get the same position i hope i answered all your questions thank you begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you sofie can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from ph ignacio lopez from santander you are now live q hi you hear me begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa ph hi banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 q yes hi yes i have two questions on one side on lending growth outlook in spain i mean performance in the quarter has been strong if you could just update a bit us on the outlook for the spanish nii and the rate sensitivity domestically and also yes i have another question on the cost side if you just could elaborate a bit on what were the changes in perimeter or the initiatives that you are pushing in the digital consumer bank what should we expect going forward if i just may one i mean its very early probably but if you could just give a bit of a sense of what should we expect of the impact in poland from the measures announced yesterday by the prime minister it would be very useful thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay ph ignacio the third question i got the information yesterday probably its a bit early yeah so i im sorry i cant elaborate more on this space probably in the coming days or weeks once we know more our ir department will be we will be more than happy to share with you our views but now its a bit early naturally the trends it sounds definitively not positive for the banking system but difficult to say at this stage and to guide you with any impact on the other side youve seen the results in the franchise that our stellar results and well i do expect that these measures potential measures that come will not harm significantly this net income generation but well see well see well come back to you on this lending growth in spain nii sensitivity well lending growth spain mortgage market has been quite strong in the last two quarters or in the last three quarters and this is the this has been one of the main drivers the other driver is in more in the cib space where on the back of i were referring renewal energy i were referring also the energy sector where we are weve been pretty active on the lending growth that you see there comes from particularly these two spaces mortgages and the other side cib in the middle market ph sebs we havent seen a strong activity there nii josé will elaborate but its north of billion sensitivity josé will you want to elaborate on this josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah the sensitivity we have two rates right now in the group is in europe continental europe is around billion ph basis points parallel shift in the interest rate curve approximately million in the uk and million in the us in south america after having raised rates earlier we are approaching the point of neutrality already probably in the second half and should be positive in next next year josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay finally your question ph ignacio if i get right was about the consumer bank you mentioned the perimeter well what weve done last year we bought a company leasing company in germany along with hyundai a joint venture we bought from the market and the other developments we have is we entered in a business in greece with the main importer of cars in greece and we are developing this business and also banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 other minors was mentioned by josé in the presentation the agreements with piaggio and others that well you can say this is business as usual yes somehow at the same time means that we are changing the perimeter is a way to grow the business begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you ph ignacio can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from carlos peixoto from caixabank bpi youre now live carlos peixoto q analyst caixabank bpi hi good morning carlos peixoto from caixabank how are you so first question would actually be on the outlook for cost of risk in spain i believe that the fourth quarter you have guided to roughly basis points for the full year where the first quarter is around basis points yeah ph in my mind in my math i was wondering if youd keep the guidance for the full year or if it changes in with the war in ukraine and rising energy prices will mean some changes on that front then on the second question regarding capital i was wondering if you could give us some color on the pending regulatory impact that you see for and if there are any in and on a related question i was what would be the currently the minimum level that you would be willing to see indiscernible going down to in the context of an acquisition lets say banamex acquisition obviously perhaps some reference there thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay thank you carlos outlook for cost of risk in spain we got you in the region of basis points we basically i if i remember well we said were going to have the cost of risk of last year that was or close to basis points i remain comfortable with this guidance yeah even in the newest scenario i dont think that this is scenario is going to affect materially our expectation for the cost of risk in spain its true that were going to have the expiration of the extensions in indiscernible now starting in april the same month and well ive being talking to you many times about some uncertainties surrounding this and theres still some uncertainty how the those customers are going to behave having said that the risk we have here is only of the outstanding volumes and is not going to change materially our outlook the cost of risk for the whole year in capital i would leave josé to elaborate on the regulatory impact that will come let me to elaborate on youre asking for a minimal level we dont have a minimum level stated as we have a target to be to be at and we this is our target but we dont have as such as a minimum level youre asking for banamex i should state again as we stated the last time the question that i think was ph ignacio made the question about banamex i said what we say remains and in what we said does was that we do not plan to issue shares potentially to buy banamex not in the parent company or in the subsidiary in mexico and this remains yeah so the conditions we established to potentially buy banamex remains in place including not issuing shares and josé do you want to elaborate on regulatory capital banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 indiscernible josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah in terms of regulatory chargers and models this year same estimation we mentioned in the previous quarter to basis points this year more or less for we wouldnt expect any significant amount obviously but its still very far away but with what we know today very very little josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa for the very first time we dont expect indiscernible josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa regulatory charges indiscernible josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa yeah okay thats great begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you carlos can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from pamela zuluaga from credit suisse bank you are now live pamela zuluaga q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd hello good morning this is pamela thank you very much for taking my questions i first want to ask a followup if you were to be interested in acquiring citibanamex again quoting you without the possibility of issuing capital you would need to rely on organic capital generation so could such an interest potentially change the payout targets that you have currently or would any shortfall in the required funding come from any potential divestitures and then if i may some questions one around the cost of risk the cost of risk for the quarter was still quite below the guidance for the year even without allocating the covid overlay which i understand was the case have you had any updates so far to your ifrs models or are you waiting to see how the macro continues developing so do you anticipate a pickup in provisions later in the year or could another potential release in provisions offer upside to the cost of risk guidance for this year around spain kind of in line with what carlos was talking about but more from the loan growth perspective do you see the mix how do you see the mix evolving do you see the extension of the ico guarantees kind of banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 revitalizing the corporate segment this year how is the high inflation amid rising energy prices in the country impacting the consumer book have you seen any weaknesses there so far and im sorry if i may one last one i was looking at the interest rate sensitivity that you were giving for europe its now lower than what was disclosed at the end of can you maybe give us some color on this change thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay thank you pamela let me to go with your questions well your first question was in relation with banamex again is this may affect the buybacks and well the dividend policy for this year is public its the intention of the board to continue with the payout of half in shares half in buying back shares and half in cash so there is no intention to change this and thats the question organic capital generation im fairly positive on this yeah so you see the quarter and i do think that we will ph not keep growing but taking into account return on tangible equity and riskweighted assets growth that in the quarter was in the region of if i remember well probably well not going to keep growing risk weighted assets there our capital generation taking into account the payout policy is going to be significant our capital accumulation is going to be significant thats what i can tell you at this stage cost of risk update well i mentioned to you the main changes the main drivers were brazil where i do elaborate the cost of risk is going to go audio gap okay as you say that well in relation with the interest rate sensitivity when you come from negative in europe like we are in europe and you go into positive territory very likely going from minus to plus youre going to capture yeah so on this space youre going to capture elasticity will change i dont know if this is going to be or beyond that so that makes sense is as the rate goes up at the beginning sensitivity to rates is extremely high is close to and depending on the utilization but is very high as you go by and the central bank is keep increasing rates or the market keep increasing rates elasticity changes and ph years elasticity ph as what josé explained this is happening already in poland not yet in uk but may start relatively quickly in uk if the bank of england keep increasing rates and is far away in europe where we need well basis points official rate at least to start to change the sensitivity that at the beginning is extremely high yeah so this is how you should think on this at least in our balance sheet that is extremely asset sensitive as you know because the mortgages because all the sme lending that tend ph to be sure on and then to be euribor based for the cib in the cib space and large corporate so highly sensitivity to rates with elasticity that keep changing along the increasing rates from the central banks begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you pamela can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley you are now live banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc hi good morning i got two followup questions maybe one on brazil and one on capital josé antonio i think on brazil if i understood you correctly i think you said highsingle digit nii growth you still remain confident given the minus quarteronquarter that seems to imply that theres going to be sort of recovery significant recovery over the next few quarters can you sort of maybe confirm that ive heard correctly and if thats correct what would be driving that rebound and on capital again a followup on some of your comments i mean  to me at least should have been the most difficult quarter given what the curves have done and youve actually pulled off a pretty decent sort of capital print is with the slowing growth you mentioned youre confident that youre going to continue to still grow if you if banamex doesnt happen and you end up i dont know ph million or whatever at the end of the year you might come up do you think from your discussions in the board or from management thinking what would you do with our capital would you ph is your preference would be to keep the extra buffer to distribute it maybe normalizing sort of payout indiscernible or do you see you can grow into it or ma just sort of some thoughts there thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay thank you alvaro let me to elaborate again in brazil yeah so why i do see this trend i mentioned to you the dynamics in the balance sheet you have on one side customer spread that went up from around one year ago to i dont know or ph or something like that in the first quarter this year and on the other side you have the alco portfolio that last year was producing revenues of around billion and now is close to zero so if you take into account the two dynamics one is customers the other is the alco is what allowed me to be to give you the guidance i gave to you so you put these dynamics forward and you seek how much the rates can increase from where we are and how much the customers that can the revenues coming from customers can increase based on the spreads you get dynamics that in line with what i mentioned to you before i hope it helps you to project the numbers with these ideas second capital while you say pretty decent its more than pretty decent yeah so this seems to me a bit downbeat yeah its very good capital generation and while this is on the back of good results and well growth we keep growing and well probably weve been telling you that we our alco portfolios were nonexistent in some indiscernible what ive seen in many banks is the available for sale portfolio impacting strongly the capital and in our case our position well in europe is nonexistent and in other markets at least i think is more than other banks based on the impact ive seen in the capital base going forward were going to keep generating capital in line with the guidance we gave you and josé already elaborate on the potential regulatory impacts that well for this year and expectation next year ph not regulatory impacts discussion at the board well its also transparent yeah so the board said that we established the intention of paying payout half insurance half in cash and intention to go to the okay so this is up to the board naturally this is not only up to me but the further discussion i will expect if you ask me in the board is when were going to from to well this is the first step i will expect the board to take and as i said it is up to the board to discuss probably two quarters from now is when the discussion need to take place banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you alvaro can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from andrea filtri from mediobanca you are now live andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom good morning back again on capital sorry but its a clarification youre now targeting cet1 you maintained that but what will be the plan to maintain this if banamex came along you dont want to issue shares at the parent or at a subsidiary level is the target a hard target or could you compromise on it in the case of banamex second question is just a kind of yes or no should we expect an ifrs charge in  given the poorer macroeconomic scenario if you could elaborate please on your alco strategy and if you have already included that evolution in your guidance or if you have upside from that and just finally a very quick one brazil whats happened to taxes this quarter and is the npl increase we have in the quarter just due to the new definition of default or is it a genuine change thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay on capital well indiscernible our target is and remains at and this is the target that the board established naturally the moving parts here are the growth were going to achieve that in the current scenario activity levels in line with a less growth in the world probably will be a bit we expect to keep growing probably less so than otherwise would be the case and what we plan to do with this is too speculative youre asking third question if something happens what happens afterwards difficult to elaborate on this but well we have the tools the tools to match our capital we can indiscernible we can dispose assets we can do many things okay so we have the commitments that we have which is the payout with shareholders not to issue shares those are the commitments that we have and an intention going forward when ph advise to go for a higher payout ratio this is our stance on capital and i cant elaborate more on this second question ifrs charge we dont expect material charge there naturally we need to apply the new macro scenario but we do not expect any material charge and that changed our outlook for the cost of risk in brazil taxes well plenty of moving parts there the main one is the what they call ph ecb when they pay dividends on their own funds or something like that euros indiscernible i dont know how interest over own equity or something like that when this happens they pay a dividend that is free of taxes and this affect your review the last couple of years you have this quarteronquarter nothing special this year sometimes it happens from one quarter sometimes it happens in a different quarter and in this particular quarter you reduce what is called the ph ecb in brazil npls naturally new definition on default affect npls everywhere including brazil i dont have in my mind probably ir can give you how much is the impact of the new definition on default in brazil in the npls i gave you for the group that was see if i remember well basis points indiscernible basis points in the npl so i dont know how much this was in brazil but well provide you with this number for brazil banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you andrea can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from francisco riquel from alantra you are now live francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes hello most of my questions have been answered just wanted to ask on the uk business the mortgage volumes are stronger than we thought but i understand that the spreads for new lending are also very low if you can update on the front book back book dynamics and on nii guidance and in the uk and overall in the profitability of the new mortgage business thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay thank you francisco for your question uk well as you see the nii has been evolving in a positive way in the last couple of quarters on the back of volumes mortgage volumes good spreads when rates start to go up and the translation of this increase in the swap rates into the mortgage the new origination in mortgages produce some attrition in the nim of the new mortgages having said that overall we do expect continue the good news to continue on the nii we expect to continue to grow nii in the uk while mid lowmidsingle digits probably we continue to expect to grow in this line so we are not positive on top of this you have the changes in rates naturally okay so that while you have the sensitivity to rates that is starting to show up yeah so the first inclusion rates was if i remember well in december it takes two month more or less till this goes into the pl so we saw another increase in rates that is going to show up so we will see what probably is not yet well known is what is going to happen on the liability side in the uk in a ecosystem where there are plenty of new players that may affect the traditional elasticity on the liability side yeah so this is a it has to be transparent transparent ph with you this is unknown at this stage the market some market participants fear that were going to have immediately very aggressive players on the back of higher rates we will see if this happen if it doesnt happen this may change a bit the outlook for this but in general i feel constructive were going to keep growing there with flat costs so operationally were going to have a very good trends in the uk begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you ph paco for your questions can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from carlos cobo catena from société générale you are now live carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hi hi thank you very much for the presentation and yes most of my question has been answered but i have a couple of follow ups on cost of risk the cost of risk this quarter its around to basis points i remember that banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 still remains below your basis point guidance for the full year and also you kind of revised that slightly higher after the conflict in ukraine so shall we expect a gradual increase in the cost of risk driven by that higher loan losses expectations in brazil is that the main driver or are there other moving parts that should ph come back to the basis points guidance and that guidance is my own words you havent really provided that specific target and the other one have you used the provision overlay this quarter and how much is left thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa so the cost of risk were going to be approaching the basis points i think were going to remain below of this is what weve said were going to be below expected across the cycle using the indiscernible of this is our guidance in the cost of risk i elaborated the markets in which we expect changes us trending up brazil trending up i already elaborate on this and spain trending down those are the main moving parts that explain this expectation for the cost of risk you see the provision overlay we havent used that much so they are telling me that less than million here and there so not material in this quarter yeah so but remember that when we run the ifrs we would need to necessarily update where were going to head into based on unexpected the losses used in the new macro yeah but as i said before we do not expect a big deal in this ph exercise at least the macro scenario change begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you carlos for your question can we have the next question please operator next question is coming from daragh quinn from kbw youre now live daragh quinn q analyst kbw hi good morning thank you for taking my questions first question on the valuation adjustments or other comprehensive income which improved in the quarter i think by about billion so improving on in equity but then was just curious as to why that didnt translate into an improvement in capital where there was a negative impact from market valuations maybe you could just provide a little bit more color around the moving parts of fx bond portfolios etcetera and how they impacted capital in the quarter and then second question on spanish revenues firstly on fees which delivered very good growth this quarter relative to maybe some of the seasonality we would normally expect in  versus  so just if you could provide a little bit of color of what youre doing that is growing the fee business and is that a sustainable level of growth for the remainder of the year thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa ph so the valuation is due to the effects yeah so the changes in the we go back to you and explain where the changes were but the main driver here as i mentioned at the beginning the fx play a significant role and this affect naturally the tangible net asset value per share because these affect the equity and this valuation is due to the fx as you know the euro depreciate almost against every currency in which we work banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 and this has had the impact you mentioned but you need more elaboration and specific details on it happy to do that through our ir department fees you mentioned the seasonality   and you mentioned also that  was better than you were expecting well the fee income was better than expected due to transactionality levels that grew significantly and cib business yeah you saw cib business when josé was presenting the results the corporate investment banking activity our fee income is growing very nicely our business is gathering traction it has been gathering traction for a couple of years and our fee business our cib business did very well also i should mention the wealth management and asset management business that they are growing doubledigit but not as the growth is ph less so down in cib cib quarteronquarter results went up and partially was due to the good fee income generation and also this applies to wealth management and asset management that performed very well in the quarter and this is on the back of the good fee income generation that we got josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa and with regards to the available for sale impact on capital in the quarter it was ph basis points so the alco portfolio impact on capital was ph basis points begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you daragh for your questions can we have the next question please operator our next question is coming from britta schmidt from autonomous research you are now live britta schmidt q analyst autonomous research yeah hi there thanks for taking my question just coming back to the rates theme with 12month euribor already having moved what sort of impact do you expect in spain for and when will we start seeing that and maybe you can give us a rundown of what rate expectations you have incorporated in your planning for the uk brazil us the months euribor and maybe mexico as well thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay well provide information on this yeah in spain the euribor let me to speak in my memory our mortgage book that is the one euribor to amount affect like billion of our portfolio in spain yeah so it takes two month three month before when the euribor we applied the euribor of april to the renewals in june okay and these affect to indiscernible along the year yeah so ph amount is a fairest answer and billion or something like that yeah so this is the sensitivity of euribor more in euribor three months so ph youre not going to see this effect the euribor three month start to go up and this depends on when the renewal but its another million billion in companies more or less related with euribor this is to give you a sense of the asset sensitivity in the spanish book banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 you mentioned also other countries we provide you with the data we are geared toward high rates in mexico clearly in uk europe ph and the euro area including poland is a bit negative in brazil and we are seeing that already and chile is much more difficult because we have a trade between inflation and nominal rates that is much a bit more complex yeah so depends on what happens with indiscernible inflation is fairly volatile but in general one thing to offset the other but in specific quarters maybe youre going in a way another way in another quarter yeah so you have something to add josé no okay begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you britta can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from fernando gil de santivanes from barclays you are now live fernando gil de santivanes q analyst barclays capital securities ltd hi thank you for taking my question i have just one question on the alco portfolio i see that the size has gone up by billion this quarter i was wondering if you can update the strategy among the european part of this portfolio when do you expect this to go up and how far can you go up and if this is included in your forecasted outlook that you have provided thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa we dont have euro portfolio at this stage we have i think billion in portugal yeah so its very minor yeah nothing in spain and in our forecasting we are not counting in any alco portfolio josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa and again josé antonio already referred to this we did an increase the alco portfolio size in any country in the quarter the increase in euro terms is because of the exchange rate begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you fernando for your question and can we have the last question please operator our last question is coming from benjie creelansandford from jefferies you are now live benjie creelansandford q analyst jefferies international ltd yeah good morning everyone thanks for taking the question two quick questions on lending and revenue growth outlook first of all in brazil it looks like you are continuing to grow below the system i was just wondering whether you expect to kind of remain more restrictive versus the market through the rest of this year and whether youre aiming to change the mix of the book in brazil going forward banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 and the second was on the european consumer business youve obviously talked about the inorganic opportunities youve also talked about unemployment been a very important lead indicator for risk in the consumer business but perhaps from a revenue and a loan growth outlook leaving aside the inorganic opportunities given the inflationary pressures etcetera what are you seeing in terms of customer demand levels at this point in time how do you expect that to trend through the rest of this year thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay lending in brazil youre elaborating in relation with our lending standards were going to remain where we are as long as till the point we see stabilization in the risk premium yeah so if we are right we expect the next two quarters to have stabilization in the risk premium if that were the case we may become more confident to start to grow strongly against maybe in the last part of the year but this is im sharing with you my expectation we need to look at the data we need to look at the vintages how the vintages coming and how do they behave till we change our stance towards our lending consumer lending in brazil the other questions santander consumer finance in europe aside from inorganic opportunities well this is a business that i mentioned before that were inorganic i dont know how do you deem opportunities when we are take new oem to our portfolio you may deem as inorganic or organic what i can tell you is very likely this continues to happen yeah so we are gaining significant share and we are a partner of choice for many oems that are willing to expand into europe and very likely were going to capture opportunities there aside from that that you may indiscernible organic or inorganic that some other how do we see the customer demand well as you know theres scarcity in new cars the supply is weak we are seeing this in the stock finance our stock finance normally in europe stays at billion with the car dealers now stays onethird of this or less this tell you about the situation of the supplydemand dynamics in the industry this is for new cars so that is what restrict the volumes there the remuneration is more supply and demand when we go to used cars the opposite is happening yeah so prices went up and demand is the prices went up due to the strong demand there and our remuneration has been pretty strong if you look at the quarter our remuneration in auto lending in europe was grew more than yeah when the market for new cars decreased a bit okay this tell you we are gaining share thats for sure and at the same time we our position in the used car market is pretty strong in the main markets particularly in germany but not only in germany but particularly in germany those are the dynamics that we are seeing and i do see the opportunity overall the business is going to grow the volumes the speed at which we grow depends on how many agreements we reach with oems car dealers associations importers chinese oems that are coming to europe this is a plenty of moving parts there but i remain on the back of our recognition as the leader in the market and the best operator in the market that is widely recognized i do expect us to keep going and to gain market share in this through a combination of traditional origination new agreements and all these things yeah so thats my expectation i hope i answered your question yeah josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay now so is the last question begoña no okay begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 yes that was the
