you sergio thank you to everyone for joining us this morning i will say when i look at the first half of the year i will say that we continue to show the main features of our bank in the sense that we continue to grow growth has been one of the features that we get during all time and the growth is reflected both in customers volumes of our deposits mutual funds and loans and also we translate this into revenues into the operating profit that grew yearonyear on constant euros so our operating income consistently keeps growing we delivered volumes welldiversified across regions and businesses the performers were supported during this year particularly in the pandemia by increasing digitalization with the strong growth in digital customers and digital sales  profit we translate this growth in volumes into profitability  profit was billion including the single resolution fund contribution of almost million excluding this quarteronquarter growth was no extraordinary items were recoded this quarter the first half of the year we reached a recurrent a attributable profit of billion as you know we did a ph charge for restructuring cost in the first q so at the end the underlying profit was billion the largest since the return on tangible equity increased to compared to the first half of revenue was higher efficiency improved and the cost of credit dropped notably to basis points first we announced the agreement to acquire amherst pierpont in the us and a proposal to acquire the minority for we dont own in scusa the we do not own today our capital position remains solid this common equity tier ratio was above our target range and we continue to generate organically capital qonq and riskweighted assets growth on the accrual for and the accrual for shareholder remuneration inside our range of to payout banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 finally our tangible net asset value per share increased this quarter to around per share in short i will say we achieved our targets we exceed our targets in the first half and we remain very focused on building a more resilient inclusive and greener businesses so when we go to the revenue generation in the quarter as i said we kept growing the customer base as you may expect the digital transactions kept booming in this environment plus and digital sales increased by percentage points as you can see this well spread across the board among the different products mortgages consumer cards deposits investments insurance so digitalization is making a good progress across the board at the same time ph we relate these as i mentioned before to our income that kept growing keep growing operating income and efficiency on the back of our efficiency plan our costtoincome ratio improves to at the same time and this is important we are top in nps in seven markets in which we work and this is wellrecognized by the market going to the pl moving to the the exchange rate has difference with our quarters has very small impact in the quarter but still has a strong negative impact yearonyear minus percentage points in revenue around percentage points in cost looking at the results on constant euro basis revenue grew mainly in those related with customers cost discipline in an environment that inflation is accelerating all across the board we continue to reduce loan loss provisions compared with the previous quarter and we improved the cost of credit which i will describe later in more detail we didnt record any extraordinary items in  recall that we recoded the million restructuring cost in  additionally in the same period last year we recorded the goodwill adjustments we delivered a first half underlying profit of billion importantly and is i want to underline this all regions in global business are performing very well all our three regions contributed roughly to of the group profits with strong profit increases in all of them once again the us performance ph is down south with a profit of circa in  and billion in the first half of digital consumer bank which contributes to of the group underlying profit also increased its profit significantly amid a challenging environment in the first month of the year regarding our global businesses cib had another excellent quarters around million net profit in the quarter after a record performance in the previous quarter wealth management insurance has gradually recovered in recent quarters and grew at doubledigit rates both in volumes and fees in the first half of this year this positive performance by region together with the support of our global business continues to demonstrate that our geographical business diversification is a fundamental pillar of our business model we see trends we see consistent trend across the board nii and fees increased and reached prepandemic levels i will run you through these in more detail in the following slides cost control and the costs of higher inflation and increased expenses are related with higher activity loanloss provisions declined with a widespread improvement in the cost of credit in short a very good quarter reflecting the rebound on activity that was more intense ph in the quarter particularly in the month of june banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 if we go to the nii we grew the nii compared with the first half and quarteronquarter as a result of higher volumes quarteronquarter and yearonyear with a widespread growth by region and country regarding margin management we saw repricing liabilities in europe mainly uk mexico in europe mainly in uk mexico and chile and improving loan spreads in us uk and poland in addition there was a positive impact form the tltro finally average interest rates continue to have a negative impact despite the hikes in brazil plus basis points since june mexico plus sic basis points in june and chile plus basis points in july these increases will materialize positively in nii in the coming quarters when it comes to the fee income they reflect clearly the rebound on activity in this slide you have several key products and you see the growth compared with the first half of and quarteronquarter the quarteron quarter i am going to focus more on the quarteronquarter was particularly intense on the back of the some normalization i will not say full normalization of activity levels but it was this some normalization you can see that we are growing strongly in the main business of the bank being from traditional business like acquiring business cars or the business in private banking or cib that this quarter grew decreased versus previous one but the previous one was kind of an extraordinary quarter we expect as the normalization progress this will continue in the coming quarters in cost as you know our efficiency improved basis points yearonyear thats a good track record europe recorded the highest efficiency savings 8percentage point reduction that is a quantum net we continued to see significant increase in inflation in all countries particularly in the us where inflation have the biggest jump since in this context group costs rose in real terms excluding inflation costs were lower after the investments in it in europe costs were lower making we are progressing indiscernible we are reducing billion cost in europe spain had a decrease uk is lagging a little bit behind but we will accelerate in the second quarter and onwards in the region efficiency in the region in europe stood at in north america cost increased mainly driven by technology expenses and amortizations in real terms us increased and mexico fell efficiency in the region stood at in south america the increase in cost was greatly distorted by the very high inflation in argentina in real terms cost declined in the region brazil minus chile minus and argentina plus efficiency in the region stood at finally in digital consumer bank cost increase is due to changes in perimeters six of the leasing business we bought one year ago in germany and some investments on the utilization so well continue to do the transformation of the bank and this will have reflect in our cost and conversion ratio as we progress in our transformation plans particularly in terms in europe where we are committed to deeper transformation of the business the cost of credit while i mentioned number basis points basis points in the last six months this set our expectations well probably for the whole year we will be running at this level at around cost of risk for the whole year the npl ratio remains basically flat the loanloss reserve still in billion in the balance sheet we think nonperforming loan coverage ratio while the overall what we are seeing the trends were seeing and the cost of risk we are seeing better indiscernible than the one embedded in our models for all the individual suspensions the mortgage being consumer on the back of lower unemployment than the one estimate in our models and actually better house prices in our marked book that leads to a lower potential cost of banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 risk in this space in companies particularly in smes were still in a proven mode while we are seeing a recovery we need to see how intense is the recovery and once we assess this we will be in a position to assess this so compared with our expectations one year ago the situation is much better than the one we were embedding in our models the profitability ratios on the back of this strong results naturally and the return on tangible equity went to the underlying eps north of per share and the tnav quarteronquarter well i will say is the return on tangible equity and return on riskweighted assets are higher than in so those are the main ratios and going to capital we continue to generate capital organically in the quarter basis points with a profit earning we are accruing a payout on underlying profits and this is in the organic capital generation regulatory and modelrelated impacts were basis points in the quarter and well basically the counterparty credit risk counterparty risk on derivative operations basis points and trim on low default closures where the impact was basis points after that the correct tier phasedin ratio was so we are above our target above the upper limit of the range and we enjoy a significant very large margin buffer so additionally while the group is still conducted by eva we will probably describe it we expect to continue to show a consistent performance on this indiscernible the previous one we came always at the top with the capital depletion being one of the lowest among our peers in europe so i will say that our capital generation and the organically continues to support our medium longterm goals so with our strong tangible equity progress into our goal of having a mediumterm target to this should allow us to grow significantly the business to have a payout in the range of to and to face the potential regulatory impact that may come down on the road and finally let me comment a little bit on the esg we made strong commitment on esg on the environmental side we were become a founding member of netzero banking alliance this requires some specific targets in power generation oil and gas and we already published our target for the netzero banking alliance in power generation were working in three different directions in the environmental issues improving our financial product to support customers issuing in our own green bonds that we used this year already billion green bonds as part of our global sustainable debt plan and finally mobilizing green finance we mobilized this year in the first half billion in green finance bringing our total of million since the beginning of our commitment in so we are the market leader in the renewable sector financing the renewable sector and well continue to lead renewables project finance league tables on the social side while the santander finance for all helps people to get access to the financial system this is similarly important in the microcredit business and also in the financial education we have as you now microfinance alternatives already launched in brazil mexico uruguay and colombia and well be launching it in peru this year as a result of this we were recognized as the best bank for sustainable finance in latin america by euromoney in governance we have clear and robust governance across group of subsidiaries we ensured ongoing board effectiveness balanced tenure and diversity in addition we included esg metrics in our executive bonus scorecard and now i will hand the call to josé that will continue to elaborate about the regional business how they are performing in different countries josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 thank you josé antonio and good morning everyone i will indiscernible with a brief summary of the regions and then i will elaborate on the main countries in europe we are accelerating one santanders transformation which enables us to progress towards our mediumterm targets we have positive volume growth yearonyear almost in all markets following the trends that weve seen since the beginning of the year revenue increased yearonyear cost control was maintained and efficiency improved in addition we had loanloss provision introductions in most countries and a lower cost of risk at basis points in north america strong profit growth boosted by cost of credit improvements in the us cost control and revenue increased revenues increased excluding disposals return on tangible equity in the region was the group announced several transactions which i will explain later in south america we are strengthening regional ties in order to continue growing profitably supported by record new customer increase in recent months we had a strong rise in loyal customers up and in digital customers up reflected in doubledigit volume growth return on tangible equity reached in the digital consumer bank we also saw positive performance yearonyear after the significant pickup in activity in the quarter so in summary we have delivered robust performance in all regions in the quarter let me now analyze the main countries in more detail in spain as the economic activity started to show signs of recovery our stock of loans expanded in the quarter new mortgage lending reached its highest level in the last three years and consumer lending recovered to prepandemic levels on a yearonyear basis the loan portfolio increased mainly in smes and corporates which lagged after the boost on indiscernible quarteronquarter underlying profit was heavily affected by the sfr contribution million in spain excluding these net operating income was higher with a positive performance in fee income and cost in the first half profits increased yearonyear nii grew driven by tltro and active management of funding costs fee income recovered to prepandemic levels on the back of transactional fees the insurance and mutual funds we show a record inflows in the first half we reduced cost by reaching an efficiency ratio which is well below peers average positive indiscernible in the period delivered over growth in preprovision profit with regards to provisions well remain cautious as to the recovery of the key sectors in the spanish economy such as tourism for the second half of the year we expect the trends to continue with a slight increase in loans and deposit volumes revenue should recover to prepandemic levels at low singledigit rates and in costs we expect to maintain the trend the downward trend with a decrease in costs by yearend in the uk we had a strong increase in total income driven by nii growth of yearonyear this was a result of management actions to replace deposits reflected in nii and net interest margin improvement of basis points yearonyear in addition volumes grew driven by mortgages and governmentbacked business loans costs continue its downward trend reflecting progress on our transformation program which resulted in strong efficiency improvement of percentage points loan loss provision releases of million in the quarter reflect the absence of significant charges and an improved economic outlook in short another positive quarter with a strong increase in profitability we expect to maintain a positive trend in nii for the yearend while costs should drop as the optimization plans are executed we dont see signs of deterioration in asset quality brazil continued to deliver excellent performance in terms of volumes and profitability we maintain a strong growth in new mortgage lending to individuals which reached a record high in card sales and significant income growth in getnet in auto will remain the leader in individuals as a result loans grew and customer deposits profit was higher yearonyear and return on tangible equity increased to total income rose backed by positive nii performance here larger volumes offset margin pressures arising from lower average interest rates although they increased in the quarter and net fee income growth banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 higher productivity and expense management enabled us to continue to reach record efficiency levels loanloss provisions decreased strongly with a positive cost of credit performance which fell to down basis points yearonyear compared to the first quarter profit is up net interest income and fee income up offset lower gains on financial transactions and higher provisions in individuals so in short we continue to experience healthy growth with very positive revenue performance gaining market share in key segments while reducing the cost of credit quarteronquarter leading to efficiency and improving customer attraction and loyalty we expect to see the same trends in the second half in the us the work conducted over the last few years made us to be uniquely positioned to benefit from improving market conditions loan growth was impacted by bluestem and puerto rico disposals excluding perimeter changes growth was yearonyear with auto origination increasing yearonyear in the first half very positive pl performance the us was the largest contributor to the groups underlying profit both in the second quarter and in the first half reaching million and billion respectively net operating income increased on the back of resilient nii where deposit pricing actions offset lower rates strong auto leasing as well as wealth management and cards fee income excluding the disposals impact net operating income increased loanloss provisions decreased sharply as improved macro outlook customer loan relief and increased used car prices led to a strong credit performance again the first quarter profit up due to better performance on leases and the release of loanloss provisions excluding the bluestem disposal impact profit was up in line with the groups strategy to accelerate growth in the us we announced two transactions the proposal to acquire all outstanding shares of santander consumer we already dont own which is around and the agreement to acquire amherst pierpont securities these transactions follow our strategy to reduce complexity increase profitability with minimal additional operational risk and increase business diversification by expanding our exposure to corporates both transactions follow a rigorous financial discipline and goals and strengthen our business model and profitable growth in the second half we would expect to maintain our strong performance in net operating income with doubledigit growth through deposit pricing strong wealth management and cib fee income performance and continued momentum in auto leases loanloss provision expense is forecasted to have a significant improvement against last year although we would expect to see a gradual normalization in the second half after an abnormally low first half as i just mentioned in mexico our multichannel innovation continued to strengthen our value proposition which enable us to increase our loyal and digital customer base at doubledigit rates lending showed a strong performance in auto loans and mortgages gaining market share however the total loan portfolio decreased in line with a system which was still affected by corporate loans normalization we continued to shift our funding mix towards demand deposits and mutual funds profit was slowly down slightly down yearonyear total income fell impacted by nii pressure from low rates and volumes and lower trading gains due to alco sales in the second quarter of last year on the other hand fee income increased driven by transactional revenues costs fell in real terms despite higher technology investments and amortizations loanloss provisions dropped leading to a cost of risk below banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 in addition and in line with the group strategy the tender offer to acquire the outstanding shares of santander mexico that we dont own is on track to be launched on the third quarter subject to the regulatory approvals in the second half we would expect recoveries in volumes fees growing at high single digit rates and a gradual pickup in aii in nii loanloss provisions should decrease against in the digital consumer bank in consumer lending activity trends improved new lending performed very well in the second quarter after pandemic controls eased in central europe delivering growth yearonyear in the quarter profit headwinds included the srf the single resolution ph board contribution exclude any profits would have been up a higher provision related to the swiss franc mortgage portfolio in poland on the other hand the recovering activity was reflected in nii fee income and cost of risk improvement in the first half profits sorry in the first half profit was up higher yearonyear costs grew yearonyear due to changes in perimeter remember ph sixt and timfin and investments in digitalization on a like forlike basis costs were down for the coming quarters we expect a strong cyclical growth in consumer finance demand delivering a midsingledigit growth in revenue flattish costs and cost of risk that would remain more or less at between to basis points let me now review the global businesses started with cib as josé antonio mentioned cib delivered another excellent quarter in activity and results although obviously the quarteronquarter comparison was affected by the very very strong recordhigh first quarter in the first half cib held leading positions in the rankings of structured finance we were first globally by a number of transactions dcm first in spain and top three in mexico and chile and ecm top three in spain mexico and poland we had outstanding first half results backed by overall revenue improvement across businesses mainly in markets and global transactional banking we expect that performance for to continue to be very positive although probably in a more normalized trends on wealth management insurance total assets under management increased doubledigit yearonyear both by market movement and commercial inflows in private banking and santander asset management of more than billion which account for of the total volume managed in insurance gross written premiums rose yearonyear mainly by noncredit related protection business in summary total fee income grew and total contribution to the groups profits was up yearonyear in the second half we expect to continue the same strong business dynamics delivering doubledigit growth in fees and profits in pagonxt as you know well payments is the cornerstone of our strategy to grow and reinforce our customer to loyalty in the first half revenue increased yearonyear boosted by the strong jump in fees higher at constant exchange rates and we expect revenues to grow strongly in the second half around and reach billion in the medium term to provide some context behind our growth in pagonxt let me share background on our three businesses merchant solutions getnet is already one of the top three acquirers in latin america and we continue to develop our capabilities across our technological hubs in america europe and asia we recorded a solid performance in the quarter exceeding prepandemic levels in active merchants and total payment volumes getnet brazil recorded a strong commercial performance reaching more than market share getnet in chile launched its commercial activity and mexico progressed in its migration plan to the global platform getnet also operates in argentina banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 we continue to invest in europe as our former domestic acquiring business in spain evolved to getnet europe and well be providing european customers with integrated offerings before the year end all in all we reached a total of around million active merchants up yearonyear and a total payments volume of close to billion in the first half up yearonyear the second component is trade solutions which support smes and corporates that operate internationally through the stateoftheart solutions one trade is already connected to our customers in eight countries after its recent rollouts in mexico and poland this solution has over active customers up versus the first quarter of the year we expect to increase exponentially as we add new services ebury we continue to invest in credit developments and platforms although volumes and revenues were temporarily impacted by the pandemic finally in customer solution in consumer solutions we will be soon rolling out a new global platform in argentina peru and colombia and now let me finish with the corporate centre we can see that results improved compared to the first half of last year mainly due to the continued positive trend in operating expenses and the decrease in loanloss provisions and other provisions due to the oneoff provisions recorded in the first half of last year for certain stakes whose value was affected by the crisis on the other hand net interest income was impacted by the increase in the liquidity buffer and we also had lower gains on financial transactions as you remember we recorded positive foreign currency hedging results in and let me turn it back to josé antonio for his concluding remarks thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you josé im going to take just one minute to sum up a little bit the result we present to you i will say our first half results were solid and consistent across geographies and businesses supported by volume growth strong revenue efficiency improvement better cost of credit core equity tier above our target range and return on tangible equity is higher really higher than the cost of ph equity looking forward well continue our strategic transformation growing and increasing profitability while we help our customers and societies by building a strong customer base achieving greater customer satisfaction with our services helping out our customers to become more digitalized based on the results obtained yeartodate and our conservative business view for the second half i believe we are well on track to outperform our fullyear goals we expect to close the year with a cost of credit around and increase our profitability ratio as well over finally we remain at your disposals for the questions you may have to us thank you sergio gámez martínez global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks josé antonio indeed now we have plenty of time for the qa session so please operator lets proceed with the first question banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 question and answer section operator certainly operator instructions and the first question is coming from sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa yeah can we move to the qa session please operator certainly its coming from the line of adrian cighi from credit suisse your line is open please go ahead adrian cighi q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd hi there thank you very much for taking my questions i have two one on capital and one on the us acquisitions on capital youve taken a big chunk of regulatory headwinds this quarter can you remind us of how much more in terms of headwinds you have to take in the second half of the year and potentially even for if you have that visibility sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa excuse me we have some problem bear with us one minute adrian cighi q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd and the second question is on the us acquisitions youve clearly shown a highlevel confidence in your capital position but can you give us a little bit more color on how you see capital allocation between the returns and the growth organic and inorganic should we expect this sort of bolton acquisition to be a regular feature of santander going forward and can you maybe discuss whether you see any technical or regulatory barrier for santander not looking at buying back the brazil minorities at some point in the future thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay let me to elaborate on our on the capital i said to you on the presentation on the main presentation that looking at the medium term the way we see our capital and how we as you know we established a medium term target for return on tangible equity of in the region of to starting for this and given the evolution we have in the business we think this is achievable clearly achievable and well i remain very confident that we will achieve this if i look at how to going to deploy the capital we generate through the business i will look for a kind of a risk weighted asset growth this is a growth story particularly were going to grow doubledigit in latin america yeah naturally maybe some currency depreciation but well we are aiming for doubledigit growth in latin america also significant growth in our consumer business in the us while in europe we see a more kind of flattish evolution of the riskweighted assets banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 now this will lead us to a kind of growth of riskweighted asset lets say in the region of to probably year onyear and on top of this we have our payout policy that is to remunerate the shareholders to and you do the math we have some spare capacity on top of this to face potential regulatory risks that were going to have still some to come with the basel iii particularly one is still a bit far from us has been delayed for several times but still there and finally we have some spare capacity to well maybe to as you indiscernible to do buybacks to do ph smallest decisions now and we have not contemplated any kind of bold acquisition of a large size so this is in my mind the capital evolution going forward and i feel very confident that were going to stay up in the upper end of our range for the coming quarters and probably coming years as always probably too early to say but probably in the coming years is pretty much the same adrian cighi q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd thank you very much sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you adrian next question please operator our second question is coming from the line of alvaro serrano from morgan stanley your line is open please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc good morning thanks its actually two followup questions also on capital in the us so on capital i just want to confirm the headwinds yeartodate i think of basis points i think your guidance was basis points is there anything thats going better or worse and there that you can share for the rest of the year and also a followup to the question i asked in  have you given any further thought of splitting your distribution between dividend and share buybacks and any color you can give on maybe helping us quantify any share buybacks that you might be thinking about and when can you be more precise about that and the second question more strategic on the us is you bought the minority scusa youve also bought a ficc broker in the us i just wanted to ask you if you could elaborate on the strategic rationale behind the two presuming on the ficc broker youre after the dollar clearing but it seems the timing seems odd on both acquisitions i would argue so can you talk about why now and what are you trying to build in the us is it a universal bank consumer bank used to be too big to integrate with the retail just some thoughts on your footprint in the us thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay let me to elaborate a surprises in capital basically probably i wouldnt say we have had surprises probably the only one probably josé want to comment probably more because of the regulatory issues than the one we were expecting at the beginning of the year probably in the region of basis points basis points more banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah we the two things that are coming a bit above our expectations are the new definition of ph default remember that the regulators said that they would expect neutral capital impact from that and its going to be very far from the neutral and also a bit worse in the counterparty credit risk for derivatives that we already accounted for in the second quarter so probably we would expect if we said to maybe basis points more this year than we had initially expected josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay the second question you asked me to elaborate about the buyback well as you know last friday the ph ecb well communicated that the bank on dividends will be over at the end of september currently our remuneration policy to shareholders stays in the to beside that naturally we the board by indiscernible is going to contemplate different options naturally cash dividends and buyback can be in the table mainly with the share price trading clearly below tangible net asset value per share is clearly an option that is can be quite compelling at some point the third question was related to us our strategy in the us in the us the way we look at the business in the us we have independently of the legal structure we have like three four businesses there we have a pretty strong consumer finance building businesses basically in scusa with the origination capabilities that are quite strong as weve shown through well many years already second we have a good and growing deposit base in sbna that is growing we were able to reprice substantially and if you see our numbers our nii has been performing better than our competitors due to our ability to ph reduce the cost of our deposit base and at the same time cost of deposits base we are not taking advantage of this deposit base to fund the consumer business in the full extension that is an opportunity clearly there there we had the ph block in the cib businesses that last year probably grew more than this year keep growing significantly and we have these fixedincome broker in order to keep growing in the cib space and finally we have the private banking business in miami that well as you know is a very profitable business and is growing nicely well into double digits so when i look at the business in from this point of view we have very good opportunities to be much more efficient in the us combining our capabilities in different angles and keep growing particularly in the cib consumer space wealth management both onshore and offshore and developing some specialty business that we have inside sbna that offer returns in the region like the multifamily business that we plan to expand so taking all of these and looking from this point of view our business we are keen to growing in the us organically our business and we think that we can have returns significantly above our cost of equity with this combination of business going forward alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc thank you sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa thank you alvaro sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa next question please operator next up we have a question from andrea filtri from mediobanca your line is open please go ahead andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom yes thank you for taking my questions i have a just followup and one on spain on followup therefore if we get it correctly youre basically upping the guidance on regulatory headwinds from basically to basis points this year and i didnt understand if you also had any expectations on as the stock has kind of reacted in a flattish way to a clear beat to results it seems like the capital is holding the stock back today and on spain the cost of risk seems to remain high and certainly not reflecting the same evolution of the other geographies what is your outlook there are you essentially trying to anticipate and bringing forward some future trends or youre being cautious or its simply that the visibility remains low and therefore the cost of risk stays high and still on the cost of risk front what is the actual mechanical timing for you to allocate the overlay provisions of last year and if the macro does not materialize in line with your expectations when would you actually release those overlay provisions ph by thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay i will take the cost of risk questions and ill pass the capital question to josé so the question your question andrea in relation with the cost of risk in spain let me to share with you my thoughts on this yeah so as i said in the presentation we have on one side the individual families in consumer and mortgages where we are seeing substantial better trends that is one that were embedded in our models last year indiscernible based on the expected losses in the future thats clearly a positive on the back of i mentioned also before lower unemployment and the one we were expecting and better ph house prices than the one we were anticipating at that time yeah so and this apply to individuals when it comes to smes the situation is much more uncertain yeah so well its true that the economies are rebounding its also true that the spanish economy given the relative specialization in touristrelated activities the rebound need to be seen still we are midway to this rebound and based on the behavior of the economy i think that its too early to call ph the situation of value to be cautious when do i do think that were going to have more visibility probably when we see the economy fully open and we see tourism industry recovering or going to more normal activity probably this is three quarters from now four quarters from now its not for sure were going to be in next quarter because we are still in the middle of the this delta strain that is creating some lockdowns here and there and ph were definitely at this stage to be cautious so probably for this year because of ph risk in spain my best estimation is were banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 going to remain as it is and i will expect next year to come down significantly but i will tell you that the environment were in i advise you to be cautious particularly on the sme space cost of risk the mechanical the time to release the overlay and to well were going to go into our internal budgeting but it still depends basically how comfortable do we feel to assess a material different economic scenario than the one we embedded in our models last year as of today i will say that the scenario the current scenario i have in my mind is materially better than the one we assessed one year ago so this will lead to some or significant releases depending on the jurisdictions when this is going to happen it may happen and this is a discussion with ph risk on the risk department it may happen in the fourth quarter in this year it may happen first quarter second quarter next year depends on the economic situation and on how down the economic situation is particularly is related with covid yeah as long as we have covid some potential lockdowns here and there probably is not advisable to do that but at some point we need to do that yeah and as of today this will lead to releases when this is going to happen im not in a position to specific to put it in a specific quarter but lets say next two quarters four quarters so probably in this range you should see some of this you also saw some us and uk somehow in the quarter no material releases but we are now if you look at the numbers indiscernible in uk the same where the situation is more clear than indiscernible so advanced in the recovery josé josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah with regards to the regulatory expectations yeah so we initially expected maybe basis points to basis points maybe now its basis points higher most of the increase from where we are today will happen in the third quarter but even if we frontload the transaction we have announced and with these regulatory impacts we are very very confident we will be at the upper end of our target range this year in so we dont see a problem there thank you andrea andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom thank you sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you andrea our next question please operator next up we have a question from ignacio ulargui from exane bnp paribas your line is open ignacio ulargui q analyst exane bnp paribas thanks very much for taking the questions good morning all just have two questions on the pl on operating trends i mean one on costs i mean when we will start to see sort of like the benefits from the uk you flagged that second half should be better but i think that costs have been a bit weaker than what we expect what i expected at least in the uk also on the digital consumer bank on the cost side there has been a bit of an increase in the quarter wanted just to get a bit of color of whether its sort of like the consumer finance business or openbank what is bringing costs up in the digital consumer bank the second question is on nii in brazil i banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 mean it has been very strong in the quarter next quarter mechanically should be strong as well because of the fx appreciation but i mean just if you could update a bit on what are you focusing in terms of loan growth and what would be the margin impact in because of the hike in rates thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay let me collaborate you asked specifically at your question about uk cost well i said in the presentation that we expect an acceleration of cost reduction in uk on the back of transformation we are having in the bank and we remain committed with the target in europe for the four main units spain uk poland and portugal to reach billion so uk will accelerate and within that we will reach our targets in the transformation plan we already reached the agreement indiscernible so this is a question of time that it will come on the digital consumer bank digitization is a bit more complex here because what you have in the numbers is this is a growing business and as we reach new agreements with oems that span our business and we span our activity particularly in the leasing space we are more focusing being more efficient in transaction costs the costs compared with our revenues not that much in an absolute number because that goes down you should look at digital consumer bank growth story and we naturally in the first half we have had the first i would say four five months where we were lagging behind our the normal originations in june we got very close to the origination we expect in a normal month and for the second half of the year we think that were going to have some on the back of availability of cars theres no new cars for sales in the market due to scarcity of chips and probably we although i am optimistic that well reach normalized levels this is going to mean a break on the other side in used cars we are doing significantly better particularly our position in germany in used cars is doing much better but overall when you look at the digital consumer bank the cost side you should look in relation with the business we underwrite that we expect to grow significantly and we are growing we are reaching new agreements with new oems that help us to grow the business all across and the fourth question was about nii in brazil josé mentioned when he was presenting brazil that we expect the same trends in the second half if you look at brazil well you mentioned the interest rates interest rates in brazil have not so significant impact so some impact positive impact on the liability side not as big as in other jurisdictions due to the fact that the mandatory reserve requirement limited the impact and the loan book margin spread has remained relatively flat so in the last i dont know couple of quarters so i do expect to keep growing on the back of loan growth and on the back of market share gains we keep gaining market share in the country so we are growing faster than our competitors and i do expect to keep growing so i dont expect a big deal compared with the current trends in nii in brazil sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks ignacio next question please operator our next question is coming from britta schmidt from autonomous research your line is open please go ahead britta schmidt q analyst bernstein autonomous llp hi there good morning ive got three questions and a clarification please the first one is on pagonxt you mentioned the billion revenue target over the medium term can you give us a bit more color on what you banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 mean by medium term and maybe also when you consider the business to be breakeven in terms of profits the second question will be on legal issues what is your scenario for the polish fx mortgages now youve taken another provision in the quarter but where do you see here the endgame and maybe also you can comment on whether theres any impact on the business in germany from the bgh ruling on deposit fees or whether you expect that to have any read across for other geographies at some point and then clarification just on the macro provisions could you give us an update as to where they are now after the releases in the uk and us thanks josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa yes i didnt get the third question in relation with germany whats your comment sorry britta schmidt q analyst bernstein autonomous llp there was a ruling on reimbursing customers for increasing deposit fees without their explicit consent i was just wondering whether santander is impacted by that or whether you expect that this margin will spillover to other geographies where ph lawyers will start to launch some cases on deposit fees josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay good thank you so pagonxt more color well this is as we said in the presentation that we expect to grow revenues in second half of the year compared with the first half remember that we acquired wirecard assets and those assets well we have in our pl because of running wirecards indiscernible million or something like that the cost that we have and revenuewise we started just one month ago thats the reason why we expect to grow very rapidly our revenue base in the coming quarters without changing significantly the cost base when the breakeven is going to be you see billion medium term medium term normally we double revenues if we increase revenues in second half we should reach in the next two three years a volume of revenues in line with the number we are mentioning on the breakeven well i do have a i will say the acquiring business is going to be big very quickly they trade very quickly well i do expect probably no more than one year one yearandahalf so in latin america the business is already more than breakeven in europe we need to deploy our network in countries like uk and poland that is going to take for a while and significant investments probably takes longer in this in trade well we are developing also the network but this is a pretty straightforward business and relatively is not i dont have a specific timeframe in mind but is not very long period of time yeah so probably ir can elaborate more on this specifically with the specific details about timing some plans that we have in relation with this business swiss francs in poland we are expecting the supreme court ruling by september josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa 2nd september josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa 2nd september our provisioning now is around of the portfolio banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa of the billion portfolio josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa of the billion portfolio well highly uncertain the outcome of the ruling and we will see but in any case take into account that is we have we own of the bank we dont expect a material impact for the group out of this issue the german ruling on deposits were not sharing deposits in germany you say all this goes to other geographies we are charging for deposits only institutional money and nonoperational deposits of very large corporates so its not a significant impact to us unless this affect the professional market in which case well it will go one side and another so we have the two sides there and to be honest with you i dont know the net of the two sides there do you know josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa i dont but exactly that to say its the least josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa you are laughing so probably you know josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa there was a final question on the overlay we have not used the overlay but in spain and a bit in mexico in all other countries the overlay is unused sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you britta next question please britta schmidt q analyst bernstein autonomous llp okay thank you operator next up we have a question from carlos peixoto from caixabank your line is open carlos peixoto q analyst caixabank hi good morning thank you for taking my questions so i would perhaps start a bit or pick up a bit on the questions regarding the evolution of cost of risk in the uk and in the us as well so you witnessed here this write backs which i believe has to do with the adjustments on the macro inputs on the provisioning model i was wondering going forward what type of underlying costs of risk should we expect on these two business lines and also on the nii front in the uk if you could share some guidance on what to expect throughout the year and possibly for next year thank you very much banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay underlying cost of risk in uk us traditionally in uk where the majority of this mortgage business is of the volume somehow that so the cost of risk should be in the region you look backwards and the cost of risk should be in the region of basis points basis points has been the number that we have had for this so very low cost of risk in us its quite different on the back of the subprime business we ran out of scusa assuming that the mix remains the same you should expect a cost of risk in the subprime business was more in the region of scusa in the region of or something like that was in more with some volatility remember that this business has seasonality look at the cost of risk in one year if you look quarteronquarter you have significant seasonality you look backwards you have this but is the cost of risk in the consumer business and the other is fairly low the remaining is fairly low probably maybe in the basis points to basis points the business that is not consumer so it depends but largely on the mix and nii guidance in uk was the other question josé already elaborate on this so what you are seeing now is the result of repricing liabilities well probably almost all has been done there and the increasing spread in mortgages well as you know last year and in the first half of this year has been fairly good the mortgage market in uk is very dynamic in the last couple of weeks we see more competition in the market but we remain partly constructive on the back of high volumes and relatively stable mortgage spreads that comes and goes but we do not expect that we can indiscernible josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa if i may as i mentioned first half against first half of last year net interest margin is up basis points so we would expect to see a similar yearonyear figure for the full year maybe basis points to basis points we have a sensitivity of around million million to the basis point and that is what explains our expectations for doubledigit growth in nii in the uk this year sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you carlos next question please operator next up we have benjamin toms from rbc please proceed benjamin toms q analyst rbc europe ltd good morning thank you for taking my question just one from me please santander has been involved in a branch trial in the uk where a number of banks have come together to form a bank hub in one branch do you see this as a strategy that could get rolled out across rural areas in the uk it seems like quite a good idea thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay the branch model is largely idiosyncratic yeah so depends on the different countries the model in the uk where as you know we had a the ifas play a very big role in the mortgage market you see a model that is i would say is different from other countries particularly in our wall where we are in other countries more banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 kind of the branch is kind of a supermarket while in uk is more specialized in specific segments in which we work particularly on the savings space and mortgage space and we have the regional centers for corporate so its a business that its a model that is branches is on one side for the retail specializing in savings and mortgages and on the other side the regional centers for corporates this is a model that in our jurisdiction is probably quite unique yeah so we have we tend to have more the branches tend to be higher broader set of products in the mortgages in the branches than the ones we have in uk given our relative specialization in uk and we continue we think that the branch distribution the physical distribution in the uk is about to be growing now with the current presence and we are investing a lot in improving our digital distribution in all the subset on all the products in which we operate in the market particularly in those who are more related with fee income like insurance and wealth management and these type of products that we are investing to improve our offer sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks benjamin next question operator next up we have carlos cobo catena from société générale please proceed carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hi this is carlos from société most of my questions are already been addressed so if i may just a quick follow up on capital and regulatory impacts once youve reached this reported capital ratio north of which is south of that net of the fullyloaded impact you seems to have stopped accruing capital you started to engage in bolt on acquisitions so at which level of the fully loaded ratio of you will feel uncomfortable for the time being while the pandemic has not fully recovered so at which level you would be comfortable with the cet1 ratio fully loaded is it as we are now just indiscernible that that could be drifting lower in following quarters and that would have made you again comfortable with that and if you could just clarify on the remaining im sorry i missed this discussion because of some problems the second half remaining regulatory impact and any other potential drivers in that you would need to offset with retained earnings that would be helpful thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa sorry we couldnt hear your questions ph can you repeat the question we have some technical problems carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain yes sorry josé antonio can you hear me now josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 yes i can yeah go on carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain well so to summarize if you could you specify other upcoming regulatory impact from capital for the second half on and what level of fully loaded capital ratio would be uncomfortable for you as leaders of the bank while the pandemic has not fully recovered so i know that the former target is and youre comfortable in those levels but while we still have concerns on the economic recovery what would be the capital level where you would be taking actions so is it a floor or you will be still seeing some volatility around those levels and even lower thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa well indiscernible we are not inside our target and we try to come back to our target as soon as we can yeah so thats simple well i will focus much more on the likelihood of deploying capital at santander yeah so when you look at the preprovision profit well this is wellestablished in the stress test all the stress test the likelihood of deploying a significant amount of capital at santander is much lower than in our some of our competitors thats the reason why in this stress test we always tend to come at the top due to the less capital depletion than our peers this make us comfortable with our range yeah so when we define our range we took into account the business mix that we have our preprovision profit as the first line of defense that may that allow us to face the potential shock that may come from the business as the ones that came last year in the middle of the pandemia and well we feel comfortable with it the range is the result of our assessment where we feel comfortable to where we dont feel comfortable is below the range and josé josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa i would add to that that again we have a management buffer in the region of basis points so we are not only not only we generate a lot of capital but we are very comfortably above the minimum capital requirements and obviously the regulators feel very very comfortable with our to range and i have already got into details of what we expect for the second half or for the coming years i mean i think its very early the ecb as you know will let us know in septemberoctober what their inspection and model exercises are for the coming years but now we will update you when we have a bit more detail carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain okay thank you sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you carlos next question operator next up we have a question from mario ropero garcia from bestinver securities please proceed banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 mario ropero q analyst bestinver hi good morning just a couple of followups the first one is on cost i know that portugal and poland represent a little of the costcutting plan but we have seen very little coming from there in the first half so the question is basically if you also expect savings to rise significantly in these two geographies in the second half and then the second question considering the ongoing asset quality trends in brazil if you could confirm that you expect cost of risk to remain below not just in the second half i would be curious if you could give some views about thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa in relation with the cost evolution in both in the in portugal and poland we for sure were going to have a acceleration of cost reduction in portugal in poland we have mixed trends we are doing a large transformation plan but the salaries in poland as you know are growing at the region of so its more difficult to reduce in nominal terms although were going to have a we expect to improve our cost to income in the country nominal reductions in portugal for sure acceleration there in poland largely depends on the situation in the country where the salaries are growing were going to continue with the transformation plan but the efforts have been offset by the increase in salaries in the country yeah and second brazil the cost of risk we are running or something like that josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vice president chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa well in the coming quarters we dont expect a material deviation from this other than the ones that may come from the mix yeah so on a likeforlike basis i dont expect they will deviate its true that we are growing faster now in retail than we are growing in corporates and cib and this continue may go up but this is this will be good news i will say in the sense that the retail business is highly profitable at this stage in brazil but depends on the mix yeah if you ask me with the current mix i dont expect big deals other than basis points up and down in brazil the current scenario where the country is going to grow this year based on imf yesterday is and next year or on the back of this i dont expect a indiscernible there and probably theyll continue to increase rates yeah mario ropero q analyst bestinver okay thank you very clear sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2021 thank you mario we have time for one final question please operator in this case our last question is coming from francisco riquel from alantra please proceed francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes thank you very briefly in nii in spain a bit weaker than i was expecting down quarteronquarter so i wonder if you may comment on that on the trends and i feel that the midsingle digit growth guidance for the year may look challenging and if you can update also on the guidance in nii in spain and then second question on brazil if you can comment on the changes in management and any potential implications we should expect thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer executive director banco santander sa okay in spain nii well guide you to and thats around this so probably we are well probably the negative tams going lower repricing rates in mortgages is the only thing that comes to my mind the rest remains basically in line with our expectation probably this effect may change more or less but not a material change there on the trend and we are seeing bigger activity in mortgages that tend to be lower yields and relatively low activity on the sme and corporate space and tend to have higher yields other than that i dont see a significant change in that yeah in brazil relation with the change of management well we did a succession plan i would say business as usual sérgio will become the nonexecutive chairman in january and two members of the comex the executive committee in brazil become in the case of mario leão will become the ceo of brazil and in the case of carlos rey is going to head the latin american region while its a i would say now its business as usual i would say nothing specific in relation with the strategy and all these things our plans is to keep growing in brazil as you know the subsidiary has had a outstanding performance and also the region is having an outstanding peformance chile is having a great year and we are growing nicely in other small franchises like uruguay peru colombia and in the region so we plan to keep growing in the region to expand in some regional business across like the consumer finance the ones in pagonxt acquiring on the others superdigital in consumer in the area of pagonxt and carlos is going to have this mandate and mario leão is going to keep the mandate of keep growing in brazil and gaining market share as weve been doing with an outstanding returns north of that we probably we are now among the largest bank in brazil the most profitable one and this naturally we want this to continue into the future sergio gámez martínez
