management discussion section begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa good morning everybody and welcome to banco santanders conference call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of just as a reminder both the results report and presentation we will be following today are available to you on our website im joined here today by our ceo mr josé antonio álvarez and our cfo mr josé garcía cantera following their presentations we will open the floor for any and all questions you may have in the qa session with this i will hand over to mr álvarez josé antonio the floor is yours josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa thank you begoña and good morning to everyone thank you for attending to this conference so as you say to start this presentation that well weve been developing our activity in a unusual highly uncertain macro environment in this environment weve been able to keep growing our customer base and translating this into volumes growth and revenue growth so the most remarkable change in the quarter probably has been the acceleration starting the acceleration of nii with a growth of quarteronquarter probably this is the main banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 event on the back of activity levels and just starting to raise interest rates particularly in the eurozone where our exposure to indiscernible is high our profitability improved significantly our return on tangible equity stays in eps has grown at on the back of the profits we got in the quarter billion after absorbing million charge net of tax and minorities in poland the growth number was north of million related to the new payment holiday regulations excluding it profit grew in the quarter in constant euros in the nine months our attributable profit we got billion increasing with positive impact of the currencies being plus in constant euros the credit quality on our balance sheet show no signs of duration so far in the quarter overall because of indiscernible below and we continue to generate capital at good pace finally as you already know we continue to create value to our shareholders both in terms of shareholder remuneration with the cash dividend we announced the board approved last month and the growth in tangible net asset value per share that provides a combined tnav plus cash dividend per share of going into more details into the regions you see the growth is well spread across the board both loans and deposits is fairly balanced growth we cannot say that we are growing just in one part of the business we are growing well across the board in constant euros loans increased quarteronquarter billion with increases in almost all countries deposits were up also in the quarter with some shift towards time deposits given the current interest rate environment in the last months loans and deposits grew and in constant euros regarding our loan portfolio naturally this doesnt change quarteronquarter ph just to remind that our portfolio is fairly balanced onethird is individual mortgages mainly uk and spain by this order being uk by far the largest more than of the total portfolio the other indiscernible consumer lending the majority is auto lending in europe and in the us and finally we have an exposure north of ph billion close to of our loan book the majority in smes and corporates and in cib you see that all the main portfolios are growing so individual mortgages consumer companies so as i said balanced growth across the board looking at the income statement you have we provide you growth rates both in euros and constant euros for you to analyze in the best way you in the way you can analyze as you can see there was a positive impact from same rates of around percentage points percentage points partially offset by the fx hedge in the corporate centre that is including gains on financial transactions in constant euros revenue grew at faster pace than in  and  and cost faced inflationary pressures but continued to grow below inflation trends to this performance net operating income reached billion a record for the first nine months of the year in loan loss provisions that is one of the current topics in this particular environment there were ph two acquisition forces impacting the yearonyear performance on the other hand in there were covid19related loan loss provision released in  and  of due to betterthanexpected credit performance on the other hand in loan loss provisions include an additional circa billion in provision related to ph updated macro assumptions mainly in the us spain and uk so the macro provision roughly speaking was billion spain represents million uk million and us million and digital million of which million indiscernible funds mainly coming from covid provisions that were initiated in the balance sheet so we are seeing this as an important development in the quarter some normalization in the us as we anticipate indiscernible josé will elaborate indiscernible banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 additionally this year we recorded higher charges related to fund contributions and new resolution schemes plus lower minorities and tax borrowing in our results as you can see billion elaborating a little bit on the pl trends indiscernible to say well positive trends in customer revenue especially nii in the last quarter which we expect to continue as the positive impact of internal rate hikes indiscernible the positive impact is just starting in europe and somehow more advanced in countries like uk and us more so in poland and in mexico the opposite half is the negative impact has happened in brazil and chile as you know indiscernible rates secondly our cost grew below inflation over the years in most countries our efficiency improved slightly to compared with fullyear but this is being eroded by inflationary pressures in some regions by the lag between the almost immediate impact on cost and the revenue benefit from higher rates coming late thirdly in general we did not see any deterioration in the cost of risk or in the credit quality variable such as indiscernible we have very good cost of risk in europe on the ecb and also in north america where both the us in process of normalization and mexico are performing better than expected in south america the cost of risk in general was stable you know that brazil went up this year for now for two quarters in a row weve it has been stable we believe that we already reached the peak and some indicators more indiscernible more constructive on this going forward all in all we are confident for the whole group to achieve our cost of risk target in relation with the profitability i mentioned our rote stood at earnings per share grew ph and backed by higher profit and share buybacks we bought back and we amortized of our groups capital finally regarding shareholder remuneration policy for our intention the board already approved payout and half of this in cash by in cash and million in buybacks that we expect to be approved by the ecb soon and we start to execute as soon as this is approved as a result the total remuneration in this cash dividend is going to be billion positive tnav performance i mentioned before that is increasing for several quarters in a row on given the performance that the profitability of the group a more constructive exchange rate combined finally on capital we are very comfortable with our tier core equity tier ratio remaining above a level that we consider to be very appropriate for our business in the quarter net organic capital generation basis points after the basis points accrual for the future cash dividend the increase was partly offset by negative impacts for markets available for sale portfolios some for models mainly model markets and models at the same time we continue to deliver our commitment of disciplined net capital allocation as you can see on the slide riskweighted asset grew well below loan growth higher book from book profitability and lower ph wage of risk weighted assets with return on equity below the cost of equity now our cfo josé garcía cantera will take you through the results in more detail josé antonio garcía cantera senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and good morning everyone after the ceo presentation i will go through our performance in more detail in the quarter in more detail and well look at the progress in terms of country and the business banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 starting with profit on the righthand side you can see the upward trend in profitability driven mainly by revenue which increased in the quarter this increase was supported by nii which also increased and which as we can see has accelerated in the last two quarters primarily as spain and portugal are beginning to benefit from interest rate increases in addition to the growth that we have already seen in countries like uk poland us etcetera in north america nii grew with both countries growing more or less at the same pace and in south america it was up supported by strong growth in argentina while chile and brazil showed negative sensitivity to rates especially chile where we had lower inflation in the quarter in brazil nii remained stable following declines in previous quarters i will explain this in a bit more detail when we go through brazil the digital consumer bank was practically flat due to the although we have neutral position into rates in dcb its slightly negative in the first quarter couple of quarters and ph then neutralize on that what explains this behavior net income was flat in the quarter mostly due to weak performance in europe due to seasonality we had lower fees charged on deposits from cib large corporate clients and oneoff in credit cards in the second quarter in the uk on the other hand south america increased with an excellent performance in chile and argentina gains on financial transactions were higher driven by cib obviously quarteronquarter comparison in other income was affected by the contribution to the single resolution fund in the second quarter this is our net interest income sensitivity to rates this is consistent what we have shown in previous quarters this time around we thought it would be better to look at forward rates rather than sensitivity to 100basis point change so this is the sensitivity of forward rates relative to rates remaining stable over the next months obviously the ph bps is fully comparable because now forward rates are almost basis points and the sensitivity we showed in the previous quarter was basis points for the eurozone for instance so this is the sensitivity again of forward rates relative to rates remaining stable as expected obviously we have very high sensitivity in euros in sterling we have some additional sensitivity from ph current levels but obviously the higher the rates the higher the beta as well so the beta we have here is around to in this exercise and in brazil as interest rates remain flat asset repricing should gradually compensate the increase in the cost of deposits which as you know is almost automatically repriced its important to note that this sensitivity is based on the maintenance of the tltroiii conditions that exist at the moment and we all know that they will change tomorrow we dont know what the change will be so well adjust that accordingly in the next presentation looking at cost the ceo has already mentioned that costs are growing below inflation which as you know is one of our targets and as you can see on the slide we are achieving thanks to the transformation plans underway in all countries particularly in europe a very good performance we had in europe a percentage point improvement in the cost to income at the same time as costs automatically adjust with inflation in emerging markets it takes a bit longer in europe for that to happen so i said in south america the rising cost is explained by the automatic adjustment of cost to inflation particularly in salaries in brazil chile or argentina even so costs in the region fell a little bit in real terms and efficiency remained excellent despite a slight increase in north america its worth mentioning the investments that we continue to make in mexico to modernize our infrastructure banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 in terms of credit quality we are not seeing any significant deterioration the npl and coverage ratios have been stable in recent quarters as has the cost of risk stage exposures increased in line with the credit portfolio as previously mentioned by our ceo you can see the covid19related provision releases in the second quarter and fourth quarter of and the additional over billion of macro provisions in josé antonio already mentioned half of which came through the pl and half where reclassifications of previously created covid related provisions compared to there were loans provisions increases in the uk in the us brazil and poland but very much in line with what we expected going into a bit more detail about the quality of our portfolio we maintain a low risk profile balance sheet its mostly concentrated in mature markets of the total exposure with approximately in secured lending mostly by real estate collateral additionally the main macroeconomic variables that affect our businesses particularly unemployment are expected to remain resilient across our footprint looking at the main countries in spain of our mortgage portfolio is floating we have significantly reduced the average loan to value and the percentage of mortgages with loan to values over and our corporate portfolio improved its rating and as you know the ico portfolio is performing very well and better than expected unemployment is low and stable and is expected to remain so housing affordability has improved significantly in recent years house prices are on average lower in real terms than in in the uk of the portfolio is floating the simple average loan to value of mortgages is and less than have loan to values over versus in in terms of macro the uk has a very low unemployment rate which we believe will help avoid a sharp fall in prices moreover affordability is currently at percentage points lower than in in the us we changed the mix recently towards more prime which currently represents of the total auto portfolio and therefore is a better quality portfolio used car prices are clearly above historical levels they should gradually normalize but this normalization should take place gradually as i said because of the scarcity of new vehicles and also us unemployment is at very low levels is expected to go up a bit but by no means reaching the levels of previous crises lastly in brazil activity is gradually recovering we are growing in low risk products of individuals portfolio is secure the average maturity of our balance sheet in brazil is a bit less than oneandahalf years which means that asset quality deterioration surfaces very quickly in summary we remain constructive on the future of our asset quality now let me go in a bit more detail through the main countries starting with spain we continue to see a very dynamic market in net customer we have had positive net customer growth every month since december we have increased transactionality and weve seen robust volumes growth yearonyear profit was reported by our efficiency plans cost to income is down percentage points and a reduction in loan loss provisions the ninemonth annualized cost of risk is basis points including million from macro adjustments in revenue nii was under pressure in the first half but it started to ease in the third quarter growing quarteronquarter starting to reflect hike in interest rates looking forward for the next few months we continue to see positive trends in nii lower cost base in absolute terms and controlled cost of risk in the uk we continue to have positive new lending trends and interest rate higher interest rates obviously are supporting nii growth we had doubledigit growth in revenue together with strong cost control costs were down in real terms which resulted in over improvement in the cost to income and drove the strong operating performance which was up underlying profit was flat due to higher loan loss provisions versus releases in banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 we are comfortable we will reach our targets both for return on tangible equity and cost to income with double digit growth in nii and a yearonyear flat costs turning to the us again also very solid business dynamics both in loans and deposits underlying profit remained high at billion well above average prepandemic levels despite falling yearonyear following a record nine months of affected by competitive pricing and obviously the normalization of the cost of risk we continue working on normalizing our capital levels in the us so far this year over billion have been upstreamed to the corporate center so gradually we will show a more sort of transparent profitability levels in the us which as you know our objective for the long term is to keep returns on equity at around we maintain our outlook for the year of lower revenue impacted by leasing flat costs and better than initially anticipated cost of risk well below normalized levels in mexico another excellent quarter profit increased quarteronquarter driven by strong upturn in nii and lower loan loss provisions costs were affected by the salary revisions that took place in july we also delivered indiscernible profitability yearonyear supported by volumes growth interest rate management higher fees and excellent risk behavior for again we maintain our expectations of double digit growth in nii and fee income higher growth in costs affected by our investments in digitalization and obviously inflation and a cost of risk of around the performance of asset quality in mexico is excellent in brazil we continue to grow our customer base and volumes dealing obviously with the pressure on margins coming from repricing as you know we tightened our ph operational standards in the highrisk portfolios particularly unsecured individual lending last september and that still continues we are growing in low margin businesses more particularly cib and mortgages and that change in mix is obviously affecting nii but nii our repricing of assets it is such outweighting the repricing of liabilities is flattening the quarteronquarter nii is basically flat already in the third quarter and we would expect to see a very gradual improvement until more or less in the first half second quarter and its starting to grow more after the third quarter of next year interest rates have already peaked we have a 12month repricing gap so we would expect to see a gradually increasing nii in the second half of next year costs rose because of the automatic passthrough of inflation to costs in the country salary agreement in september for was relative to the of last year so we have some positive news for cost in now cost of risk around very much in line with our guidance we would expect these to remain more or less at these levels in the fourth quarter maybe a touch higher but around and gradually starting to come down next year if we turn to the digital consumer bank here the activity remains strong despite continuing market contraction we are gaining market share particularly in used cars we had doubledigit profit growth supported by fees leasing and very good cost of risk performance we expect a challenging environment for new cars but we think we will be able to continue to gain market share and we should be able to maintain high returns on equity in the coming quarters in the global businesses cib reported its best quarter in its history gaining market share in all businesses and products we expanded in the us and we maintain our leading positions in the different countries in latin america we are leaders in sustainability ranking number one in latin america europe and globally in structured finance in the renewable sector in terms of results underlying profits grew yearonyear with doubledigit growth in all core businesses underlying attributable profit represented of the groups total operating profit banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 in wealth management insurance the contribution of this unit to the bank was on a likeforlike basis so very good performance private banking is attracting new customers up also new money up billion and profits grew yearonyear in santander asset management the asset management business was affected by market volatility but it increased its contribution to group profits to finally in insurance we have sustained growth in gross written premiums and the total contribution to profit increased we expect to maintain doubledigit growth in profit contribution in this unit in the coming quarters in pagonxt total revenue increased yearonyear in constant euros almost in euros fueled by all four main businesses especially merchants and trade so we are doing better than our guidance of revenue target for the year activity is really going very well here and finally in cards i would like to highlight the efforts that we are making to improve our credit card business we currently manage almost million cards across the group and thanks to active customer management nine month revenue was higher yearonyear in constant euros in euros with very positive performance in both credit and debit cards across the regions particularly in south america let me now turn it back to josé antonio for his final comments thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa yes a few words in relation with the outlook so i should say that we expect significant revenue growth on the back of activity levels that will remain healthy particularly in our global business with the capacity to generate additional net fee income and while the additional nii growth that benefiting from activity and interest rate hikes so fairly constructive on our capacity to keep growing our revenues in the coming quarters on the costs side well we face inflation pressures youre seeing it through the pl but im confident that well continue to improve in our productivity and efficiency not only on the back of expansion of revenues that for sure is going to happen also for our capacity demonstrated capacity to run the costs well below inflation on credit quality i recognize the environment is highly uncertain but when i look at the balance sheet and the loan book well i feel comfortable that we are ready and prepared to face a more difficult environment with particularly the one in the consensus as the consensus is today for the market it doesnt worry that much even in harder scenarios we are in good position to manage this given the very nature of the portfolio on capital well we ph may not be above i feel that we have indiscernible better than the average the impact of the portfolios the value of our sales portfolios that has affected the capital across indiscernible competitors and at the same time we continue to be indiscernible disciplined in our capital allocation so all in all we expect revenue growth to more than offset cost inflation pressures and the potential increase of cost of risk and on the back of these improve our profitability and value creation for shareholders thats all on our side so we remain at your disposal for the questions you may have thank you i forgot to mention indiscernible have an investor day on the very last page on the probably i forget because im not going to be there so on the 28th of february in london we will have an investor day where we update you on the prospects for the group back to you begoña banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you we can start with the qa session please question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we already have some questions in the queue and the first one is coming from ignacio ulargui lopez from bnp ignacio please go ahead ignacio ulargui q analyst bnp paribas sa thanks very much thanks for taking my question josé antonio not sure if this will be your last results call but i wanted to wish you all the best and thank you for the support all these years i have two questions on the numbers one is on the european loan book how big has been the repricing of the asset side so far just wanted to get a bit of a sense of where are we standing in terms of the nii uplift that could come in coming quarters and also linked to the nii wanted to understand a bit better what has been the contribution of the tltro in the quarter the second question is basically linked to the costtoincome ratio you have flagged in your final remarks that you aim to keep on improving the costtoincome ratio target its going to be a bit high probably for what can you do to keep on improving ph those which looks to be to me very sticky in terms of growth particularly in latin america thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay in the first question i mentioned a little bit european loan book i said that nii expansion is just starting in europe particularly in the ph eurozone i mentioned that we have as you know the central banks have reacted the ph financial reaction has not been the same across the board in this particular cycle latin american central banks reacted first and we saw brazil going from to chile going from to more than mexico reacting along with the fed but starting higher levels and uk and us came later the european central the ecb being the last one i forgot to mention poland that the reaction was one of the first also so when you go through the different books i mentioned in the presentation that youve been seeing the impact of high rates for a while in brazil and the particular case was negative and in chile that is more complex because this is a play between inflation and nominal rates as you know we saw some reaction coming from uk us and mexico that are not just midway but somehow midway poland is advanced just like latin america you see the margin expansion and europe is just starting the loan book specifically in the loan book remember in the quarter we barely indiscernible other than the new origination and the some loans related to indiscernible the mortgage book that everybody follows indiscernible in september when the book that repriced in september was repriced with the euribor in july that was not that high compared with the one we have right now i should say that the big appreciation is going to go along the next months yeah so and its going to be pretty significant yeah banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 so you asked the tltro in the quarter the number i have in mind is ph million million or something like that josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa for spain yes for the whole thats ph million to million for spain its ph million to million josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa in the quarter josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yes josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa yeah okay so this is the impact of the tltro the costtoincome keep improving well i said in my final remark that naturally the costtoincome with the revenue expansion we expect and keeping the cost growing below inflation naturally this leads to a improvement in costtoincome i do recognize that to reduce nominal costs as we are doing in europe but cib is difficult in the current inflation environment and probably its impossible we need to renew some agreement with the unions and this is going to put pressure on this costtoincome for sure on the back of higher incomes improve but also remember that well in south america some point with the outlook that we have for brazil becoming more constructive on the trends at some point and in chile at some point we will start to recover overall im thoroughly thoroughly confident that the costtoincome should go down but youre going to have specific details on the investor day on the relation with the specific targets for this begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio can we have the next question please operator thank you the next question is coming from francisco riquel from alantra francisco please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes thank you for taking my questions i wanted to ask about brazil in particular first of all about the nii you mentioned in the past presentation that there was two quarter lag between the peak in the selic rates and the trough in nii now i hear from your comments that the nii in brazil would not grow fast until the third quarter so if you can please update the nii dynamics in brazil and if you can please update on your nii guidance here as well banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 and second in brazil its about asset quality if you can comment on the unsecured lending for individual so what is that is still driving npls up this quarter and if you can update on the cost of risk guidance for how much of a deviation and then what do you see cost of risk normalizing from here and going thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay let me to give you the big picture on brazil and specifically to the question you raised so weve been in a situation in which weve been softening a margin compression off the back of two things high interest rates that the balance sheet is indiscernible lower rates and second we changed our underwriting standards back last year in september last year that leads to a change in mix with loan origination in the back end in the lower end of the mass market and these naturally impact the yield of our new origination and the yield of the portfolio thats the impact on the nii where are we right now so we are now more constructive for two quarters weve seen the cost of risk in line with our expectations so that means that we are in a position to start to be to grow a little bit more little by little checking this and start to offset as josé said to pass through the growth in activity to some growth in nii still volumes cannot grow faster than nii for a while but this gap is going to get reduced over time as we reprice assets in the book and maybe at some point we have confidence in the mix becoming more normalized like compared with the one we have today and the one in the past so thats the expectation for nii so more constructive little by little more activity more passthrough to nii in december the asset quality josé mentioned the like at the end of the year we were guiding you between we are growing particularly in nonindividual sector less than expected growth has been limited in corporate sector i mean cib and smes where credit quality is good and the denominator push us up a little bit our expectation on the asset quality but nothing that we see fundamentally wrong in the vintage as we are analyzing on the generation in the mass market in the lowering of the mass market is where we got the problem so all in all i feel im more constructive on the outlook for brazil yeah so i think that little by little were going to show these trends i hope and show to you in the coming quarters begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio can we have the next question please operator yes the next question is coming from alvaro serrano from morgan stanley alvaro please go ahead alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc good morning a couple of questions from me i wont touch on brazil because i think youve been pretty clear but one question on uk another one on the us in the uk youve now raised your indiscernible and youve got pretty competitive remuneration on deposit remuneration when we think about the next few quarters going forward and considering whats going on in the mortgage market do you still have capacity to grow the nii im just thinking the your overall ability to grow profits in the region given the nii potential headwinds from banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 repricing of mortgages minimum deposit be sort of minimum deposit sensitivity and obviously the economic outlook sort of deteriorating so maybe an update on the outlook on the uk more thinking about next year and the second question on the us i think you called out josé i think called out the gradual normalization some of your peers have profit warned some of your competitors in the auto space have profit warned during the results season could you update us as how sort of delinquencies are performing are we back to normalized levels and its just about normalizing secondhand prices and in that context of normalization is the basis points provision charge for that you posted in a reasonable sort of fully normalized provision charge or whats the fully normalized look like for you thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay thank you alvaro for your questions in the uk you mentioned like well overall in uk as you know there is a fairly dynamic and competitive deposit market yeah so we have a large loan book its only mortgages but mainly mortgages and while we plan to keep the retail funding in line with the loan book that we have for that reason we need to react this is your question goes straight can you grow the nii having to react to the more dynamic and competitive deposit market yes i think we can josé mentioned about the beta so within that we still enjoy margin expansion understanding that we need to react as we reacted in but taking into account all of this i do expect nii to keep very constructed in the uk and growing nicely in the uk in the coming years the market is complex you know you reprice you remortgage basically onethird of the mortgage book in our case roughly speaking billion along the year and while this is going to may raise some questions because all in all its going to go from to double of this as of today and this increase should be more than enough to along with the corporate book that reprice faster should be more than enough to offset the increase in deposits indiscernible going to happen and is happening okay but i see margin expansion next year in the uk holding out in the us well your question goes in our pl in the us particularly youre referring to the auto sector what is happening there is margin expansion on the back of the deposit base of the bank fairly competitive market in prices in the auto space fairly fairly competitive more than i was expecting and what we are seeing in the cost of risk josé mentioned that the cost of risk is increasing less than expected we have several factors there one factor that is fairly negative is the leasing because on the back of the very high second used car prices we are not having gains on the disposal of the cars that we have leases as we had the previous year and on the other side because you mentioned basis points up probably is not going to be the same than previously our book is more prime than used to be and so as josé said of the book in the us is prime only is subprime and we do not expect to go back exactly to the levels we had in because the mix its true that some of our competitors show some increase in rates i havent go through the numbers and knowing and i dont know if they changed the mix indiscernible but we are not seeing this and on the back of this we are i feel comfortable were fairly fairly well indiscernible in the us yeah in fact we reassigned million of provisions that we build for covid to the new macro scenario so in that regard normalization will happen i dont expect to go back to the levels of just because the mix overall but for on a likeforlike basis it makes sense that at some point we get there overall not due to the mix but this is going to happen little by little now it is taking longer than we were expecting yeah banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and thank you alvaro can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from sofie peterzens from jpmorgan sofie please go ahead sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi here is sofie from jpmorgan so my first question would be if you could just repeat the tltro nii benefit sorry i couldnt quite hear that but then i got a more broadly the question sorry the first one is on indiscernible growth in europe you said you have very strong cost performance in europe but how should we think about the wage agreements coming off also higher investments higher it costs higher general expenses so how should we think about kind of cost growth in europe going forward and then my second question would be when would you expect cost of risk for santander to peak it sounds like brazil will still be relatively high cost of risk us cost of risk is going up uk cost of risk is trending up so how should we think about the cost of risk to be for santander and at what level indiscernible thank you begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa ill pass the question of tltro to indiscernible josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah so let me give you the figures the group has billion in tltro billion in spain billion in santander consumer finance and billion in portugal so you can do the math very easily thank you sofie josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa cost growth in europe the wage agreements so where are we in different jurisdictions i should say in poland and uk weve been updating salaries along with inflation so i should say bau business as usual in spain and portugal where we had agreements for several years in spain that is the most important one due to salaries till the end of and we are starting to negotiate a new agreement with the union probably mid2023 okay before that maybe some minor adjustments but indiscernible but we expect these unions to be quite demanding naturally and we difficult to forecast the final agreement but well looking into what has happening in spain wages in are growing at we are growing wages north of indiscernible and naturally i do expect the wages in spain to accelerate a little bit weve seen the agreement of the government with the civil servants roughly speaking for three years this is a that this establishes a kind of benchmark because it is an agreement for million people or million people along these lines i do see having a negotiation with the unions so this is my expectation its going to be possible to match keep the cost below inflation i think so with this kind of agreement this will be below inflation and probably growing the cost in the region of 3percentagesomething before efficiencies should be something to will be something doable overall in some countries less in cib probably as we are gaining share and we are expanding the business probably were going to grow the costs faster than that probably as i mentioned in the presentation or josé mentioned in the presentation cib as the main driver of banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 positive cost growth in europe while the units the retail units spain and portugal are deeply in nominal negative growth so cib i expect to continue to grow faster than the retail units where the transformation is going to go on i know indiscernible in the region for the next couple of years cost of risk peak difficult to say yeah so the macro as you know we are providing due to the macro right now we had billion due to the macro probably overall in the year if the macro remains the same or the scenario we have remains the same were indiscernible this year billion having this billion for this year because of indiscernible below if the macro deteriorates further naturally if the expected macro deteriorates further we may need to increase the cost of risk next year when its going to be basing on the consensus should be next year yeah so but naturally difficult to say yeah so based on current expectations the end of is going to be the worst period of with a significant economic slowdown being predicted having said that this is based on the scenario yeah the peak but in any case our expectation on the cost of risk is not to have anything close to what we had in the covid yeah so well below this yeah so going up but not that much thats our expectation and with the current scenario going up but are very much for levels and for sure we are including what i said before revenues increasing revenues will offset more on offsetting potential increase in ordinary costs and cost of risk begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and thank you sofie can we have the next question please operator the next question is coming from carlos cobo catena from société générale carlos please go ahead carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hi thank you thank you for the presentation a quick question on the nii sensitivity please for spain and europe you mentioned and youve updated the way you calculate the sensitivities but could you touch quickly on where do you see the mix of deposits between ph say it on term evolving and what is the term deposit beta that you think is reasonable to assume going forward and the same thing for brazil youve already explained how do you expect the nii to evolve over the following quarters but how that compares with the slide would you show that nii upside and nii in brazil is only million if you can explain or reconcile those two guidance will be helpful thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay nii since given in spain well currently almost of deposits are current account isnt but is something yeah so gradually this is going to go from current accounts towards well a combination probably of money market funds term deposits some kind of life insurance products overall what this means is well based on the past this used to have a beta that was between and yeah so in relation with the official rates and which is the percentage that is going to go to term deposit its difficult to say at this stage what i said i can say to you in the past it was a long time ago yeah so we have had negative rates for so long that probably we almost forgot this we used to have a kind of to current banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 accounts with no remuneration we used to have another to what we call median remuneration that was kind of a lower sensitivity and another kind of high sensitivity overall the beta you are using is josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa correct josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa for the whole deposit book this is what we are using and this is whats embedded in what josé said in relation with expansion of nii naturally you may see that there are some new factors here difficult to measure so online deposits is somehow new or the expansion of potential players in online deposit is there now they are playing they are the only ones that are offering high rates i dont know how important is going to be this if the rates remain in the or indiscernible its now going to be the big if the rates naturally the higher the rates go the more impact of this you mentioned nii in brazil the plus million the million is a indiscernible likeforlike taking into the forward rate the forward rates means for one year so and what we guide to you is being constructed every quarter they pass through from volume growth to nii is going to be highest thats what were telling you in the overall one year using the forward rates and no volume growth is plus million okay josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa basically because interest rates just stopped increasing so obviously because you have a 12month lag it will be as we said we are using end of september figures months is end of september next year and you would only have three months of full repricing of assets and abilities so when we look months in advance the sensitivities ph remain same if you look beyond the months obviously the sensitivity is greater carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain okay begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you carlos can we have the next question please operator yes the next question is coming from marta sanchez romero from citi marta please go ahead marta sanchez romero q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning thank you very much for taking my questions the first one is a followup on the us just a clarification on the cost of risk because antonio mentioned that we wont go to levels which if im right is roughly bps i think in the past youve guided for through the cycle level of bps are we going to be somewhere in between for next year how do you see that and also in the us if you could elaborate as well on the loan growth expectations your risk appetite generally for the auto lending business banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 and the second question is on deposits in europe you have a loantodeposit ratio about in the digital bank in the uk its true that youve got excess deposits in the spanish balance sheet but what are you going to be doing strategically in terms of deposits are you going to be chasing deposits to balance the books in the digital banks or are you going to be setting the price and are you going to be potentially pushing prices higher i think youve already launched a new platform in germany to gather deposits so where do you see the cost of deposits if you can give us a little bit more clarity on betas across the different businesses for the next to months and just sorry very quickly if the ecb changes the terms of the tltro tomorrow would you be repaying all your tltro funds or you would be holding onto them thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay the last question is the easiest one depends on the terms yeah so josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa we are prepared we were as you know planning to repay the full amounts next year if the terms change and it no longer makes sense to hold on to those funds we will repay we could immediately repay almost in full the excess liquidity we have today the liquidity that weve been building to repay next year would let us pay almost in full that but again we need as josé antonio said we need to look at the terms josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay marta going to the other questions us cost of risk in our cost of risk was close to it was or something like that yeah so normalization should be lower than that yeah so on the back of the ph miss yeah the growth in prime and prime and the bluestem sale yeah so we sold bluestem where the cost of risk was extremely high and this we think that this is going to be below the levels on for these two reasons yeah so you asked the loan growth yeah well loan growth that we have two sources of origination two main sources of origination and others that are work in progress yeah as you say stellantis we are being i think last month our penetration last month meaning september was our best month ever in penetration in stellantis so that means that we continue our good pace naturally they sell these cars and this is affecting the new car sales is affecting this on the traditional subprime space our appetite while we went a little bit we increased a little bit of ph ficos and this affects the loan growth but largely this is going to depend on the car market we are trying to up and we have some agreements with our oems we already signed mitsubishi and we are working with dealers association in order to sign agreements with them in order to diversify our loan growth we have appetite for this type of loans at the right price naturally there are some as i mentioned the market is fairly competitive now and but we want to grow this provide that we can obtain the profitability we are targeting for this business you mentioned the ph buses in europe you rightly said that our loan to deposits is higher than in uk and consumer finance significantly lower in spain and somehow in portugal what we plan to do in the consumer finance and the retail consumer bank we expect to grow significantly and now the figures are the banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 following we have a book of roughly speaking billion loan with a deposit book in the region of billion to billion yeah so in the next couple of years we do expect to add a couple of billions in deposits maybe in the region billion to billion these are figures to think about in order to close the gap not as much but close the gap between deposits and sorry loans and deposits we are in a position to do that as you know this is a business that we have more or less advanced deposit platforms in several countries in germany netherlands also some in belgium and in the past we were active in deposits also in the nordic countries and we are reactivating this in order to increase the percentage of funding coming from deposits in this business we are in a good position to do that and we think were going to be successful on this in the other markets i already elaborated in uk where we plan to keep grow in line assets and liabilities and wealth and thats the reason we think our beta is higher in the uk than it is in the spain because ph this position basically thats it begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and thank you marta can we have the next question please operator absolutely the next question is coming from carlos peixoto from caixabank bpi carlos please go ahead carlos peixoto q analyst caixabank bpi hi good morning thank you for taking my questions and indiscernible to josé for his last presentation it was a pleasure throughout these years so my question was actually on nii in spain so my question would actually be on nii in spain so you gave the sensitivity to a stable interest rate scenarios but i was wondering if you could complement that with the sensitivity to further hikes considering that ph next provision is that we will get some additional hikes this week and possibly before yearend and then finally on nii in poland i was wondering what type of evolution do you expect going forward and whether you think there could be some margin compression given the higher deposit costs as the political pressure on that front seems to be mounting thank you very much josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa carlos as i said these analyses that we showed here is consistent with a previous one in which we showed that the sensitivity in spain to basis points is million so that sensitivity to additional increases over the forward rates in spain only not in the eurozone which obviously is higher josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa well nii in poland youve seen a i will say a very significant margin expansion on the back of increasing rates indiscernible we enjoyed the cheapest funding cost in poland naturally additional margin expansion probably is going to be difficult but i remain comfortable that we can keep the nim the net interest margin going banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 around the levels we are having on the back of repricing assets although we do recognize that the liabilities cost we should pay more for deposits given our position being the less having the lower funding costs in the market so but probably working with an assumption of nim being around where it is is a fair assumption to me yeah begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you carlos can we have the next question please operator yes the next question is coming from pamela zuluaga from credit suisse pamela please go ahead pamela zuluaga q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd hello good morning thank you very much for taking my questions the first one is on the provisioning outlook youve now built a billion overlay yet youve been mentioning that you have not seen a significant deterioration in credit quality across the majority of your footprints youve flagged also that consensus sees cost of risk peaking next year however how are you thinking then about the timing to either use or release these provisions are you expecting to allocate some of these provisions to keep some stability in cost of risk in then a question on capital optionality you have managed to build capital above your target now to cet1 would you be open to increasing your current payout or is there a particular headwind that youre foreseeing and therefore youre deciding to be more cautious and then if i may one followup can you give us some color on specifically the abs negotiations with the trade unions to address the loss of purchasing power in spain i understand the last meeting was on friday have we heard anything about the proposals from the unions and what would this mean specifically for the cost inflation in spain thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa thank you pamela indiscernible we are providing based on expected losses and you are asking me about the use of this overlay naturally we are providing with a scenario this scenario we are providing is a scenario that sees some mild recession in some countries in more towards the end of so if this materializes and our models are right in theory we will use this provision okay if we are wrong one way or another we may be in a situation if the scenario deteriorates further and in the scenario is worse than the one we are expecting we keep building the other way around is releasing so everything is based on is our scenario is right our scenario is not far away from that just to understand among us yeah not far from away from that that says that second part of youll see some recession and in that case we will use the billion we already build and the extra million we expect to build from now till the end of the year but this is again this is based on the materialization of this scenario indiscernible scenario goes into capital optionality well we stated clear that the board when the board approved expressed the idea of going to at some point so is a decision that the board is going is up to the board and is not a decision taking having said that i said in the presentation that within that the is an appropriate level for us and well keep building capital banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 ab negotiations yeah while there have been some negotiations about kind of oneoff for the employees or some employees or the employees this year aside from the negotiation from the unions in the future yeah so this is not going to be a this is not going to substitute the big negotiation that is the one who matters in terms of cost this one is more about some compensation but small one and this is not a negotiation of the full agreement with the unions that will come as i said before start in mid2023 begoña morenés a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you and thank you pamela can we have the last question please operator yes the last question is coming from fernando gil de santivañes from bestinver fernando please go ahead fernando gil de santivañes dornellas q analyst bestinver securities thank you for taking my questions couple of questions please first one on spain what is your view on the potential impact that you may have if theres a change indiscernible good practices on those vulnerable the families that might be implemented this is one second on poland and the payment holidays provision that you have done are you forecasting or seeing any more coming in the next quarter and finally if you can comment a little bit on the alco strategy and the mix that you have in the spanish portfolio that will be great thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay in spain well i should say that this agreement the way we match vulnerable customers that have a mortgage with us is i should say is business as usual the agreement we try to reach is which are the ways indiscernible match this yeah so and the ways i should say we are discussing is business as usual and naturally the extra provisions if any are embedded in our macro scenario naturally the macro scenario when it comes to mortgages contemplate that we are a mortgage book and the capacity of the customers to repay the affordability the loantovalue and all these things if these deteriorate as a result of the higher inflation and lower disposable income this is already included debt so i do not need to change anything because we change this because its supposed to be included in our expected scenario naturally if the expected scenario is worse the most sensitive issue here is unemployment yeah so unemployment is the key because when i look at the real estate market in spain its not in any dimension overvalued yeah so its not the case that we had i dont know or years ago its more a question of affordability ratios for those customers in the low end with low income or medium to low income with high affordability ratios that suffered in the disposable income its more of this but is included as i said in our macro scenario poland on payment holidays we need to see yeah whats going on yeah so we think weve done i dont know all or at least the majority of the provisions in any case well if were going to assess how many customers come to claim the payment holidays and we adjust accordingly to this its not i expect not to be banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 26oct2022 significant but maybe we need to add more we will see quarteronquarter if we need to add more having said that the revenue generation of the bank and operating profit that the banks generate and as i said before to a question of one of your colleagues i feel very constructive that we want to keep relatively or very high nii that allow us to face potential higher requirements from the payment holidays alco strategy i dont know if i should pass while we start to build our portfolio little by little so its more to do josé do you want to elaborate on this josé antonio garcía cantera a senior executive vicepresident chief financial officer headfinance division banco santander sa yeah as we mentioned in the first half results presentation we didnt have an alco portfolio at the time in euros which obviously was a conscious decision that cost us some net interest income compared to our competitors but obviously put us in a much better position in terms of balance sheet value and the opportunity to read the alco portfolio going forward we have today billion already in the eurozone we are building the portfolio through a diversified indiscernible through diversified countries not only spain we have france we have italy and we would gradually continue building the portfolio over the next probably two years we dont have a figure in mind but clearly we have an opportunity to rebuild the portfolio earning more than yield which is what we have so far in the billion we will make purchases again depending on the opportunities that we see but again from billion today gradually growing to a much larger figure over the next couple of years begoña morenés global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you josé and josé antonio there are no further questions josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay thank you guys thank you for all these years following this results presentation i tried yesterday to count the number of times
