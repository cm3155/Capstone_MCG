efficiency improvement and higher profitability banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 specifically going to the numbers  profit was around billion plus quarteronquarter in constant euros plus in current euros on the back of some euro average depreciation well the currency yearonyear is different but in the quarter the euro depreciate a bit against the basket of our currencies nine month group attributable profit billion excluding  extraordinary items nine month underlying profit billion the numbers speak by themself we maintain our cost discipline and solid

on tangible equity target in the region of to moving to customers what great success on digitalization has been a key driver of the revenue and net operating income growth we recorded a steady increase in total customers and in turn our customers are increasingly using our products and services through contact centers digital channels and the branches as a result digital customers rose by more than million yearonyear digital transactions were up yearonyear and grew across all the countries between and digital sales as a percentage of total sales stood at in nine month plus full percentage points year onyear and with growth in all products across the board mainly in the ones related with individuals mortgages consumer deposits investments if we look at the last quarter digital sales reached of the total also and this is important we are top three by nps in seven markets in which we operate moving to the groups income statement exchange rates had a small positive impact in the quarter as i mentioned before but yearonyear still negative impact minus percentage points in revenue and minus percentage points in costs looking at the results in constant euro revenue grew particularly customerrelated revenue we demonstrate a core discipline in an environment of rising inflation certainly inflation is rising particularly not only in argentina indiscernible has been in the case in the last couple of years also in brazil and mexico and chile we have significant inflation now in europe additionally we had a significant reduction in loan loss provisions although they reflected in the quarter some increase mainly in the us we delivered a nine month underlying profit of billion plus yearonyear no extraordinary items in the third quarter recall that we recorded

earnings call 27oct2021 each of our three regions contributed roughly to the group profit europe north america south america and digital consumer bank the if we analyze the quarterly trends in core lines sustained and revenue growth nii up positive performance in trading gains in  and the quarteronquarter comparison was favored by the single resolution fund contribution in  on the other hand net fee income remained stable impacted by seasonality in europe and a strong figures in cib in the corporate investment banking business across the board i will run you through these in more detail in the following slides cost control in the context of higher inflation and increased expenses related with greater activity higher loan loss provisions mainly in the us and to a lesser extent in the uk as both had some provision releases in  as you already know in the us llps tend to have some seasonality in the second half of the year nii was higher compared with nine month and quarteronquarter on the back of higher volumes our loans grew billion in the quarter deposits grew billion regarding margin management versus previous year we saw a general repricing of liabilities europe north america and chile and improving loan spreads in uk poland and the us in addition there was a positive impact yearonyear of the tltro that you know very well and naturally no impact on quarteronquarter finally average interest rates remained lower than in nine month despite increases in latin america brazil mexico and chile where the rates went up and recently in poland these increases will positively impact nii in the coming quarters when we go to the fee income we continue with the recovery from the lows in the second quarter in the entire range of products saw higher activity levels yearonyear with some seasonality in the quarter mainly in europe you have the figures in the slide all the activities show a greater activity payment volumes grew significantly cars are growing ph cars are growing in a significant speed in consumer activity trends continue to improve with the strong signs of recovery yearonyear in  mainly the the motor finance business has been affected by new vehicle sales that are affected as you know by the shortages in the supply chain of the oems and while we have a strong activity probably the strongest activity we have seen so far in the used vehicles space in addition cib and wealth management insurance generate a sharp increase in fee income representing about of the groups total fee income wealth management insurance fee grew underpinned by the significant increase in assets under management and insurance written premiums cib fees grew on the back of very good activity in dcm ecm and ma in short fee income recovered prepandemic levels across our footprint set for the uk due to regulatory changes regarding overdraft since april in the cost side we continue to see and this is new a significant recessionary inflation in all countries particularly in latin america in these countries group costs rose in real terms excluding inflation costs were lower after ph a slightly higher it expenses digital developments increased activity and labor agreements our efficiency ratio improved more than basis points yearonyear to that is a very good number in the industry mainly driven by europe we recorded the highest efficiency gains in europe costs were lower making headway in our cost reduction plan which we expected to accelerate in the coming quarters increasing synergies of note spain with a decreased efficiency in the region as i mentioned before still at having improving percentage points yearonyear banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 in north america costs increased mainly driven by technology expenses digitalization amortizations and a million donation to our community foundation in the us that was recorded in the quarter of note were the performance in mexico minus in real terms efficiency in the region still at in south america the increase in costs plus was greatly distorted by the very high inflation in argentina in real terms costs declined in the region brazil minus chile minus and argentina was flat in real terms the efficiency in the region stood at with continued improvement finally in digital consumer bank cost increased due to changes in perimeters is the leasing company that we bought in germany sixt leasing and the joint venture in italy that we launched this year finally loan loss provisions well we have a cost of credit in the last months of basis points in the same period of was taking into account the first nine month of the year only the cost of risk was basis points performing better than expected due to lower provisions in most markets mainly in the us digital consumer bank brazil and chile together with the net releases in the uk the npl ratio was virtually flat year onyear and slightly lower quarteronquarter total loan loss reserves stood at billion with a coverage ratio of in addition i would like to remind you that the majority of the overlay that we recorded last year is sitting on the balance sheet we expect to make some releases in  on the back of new macro scenario which will enable the cost of risk to reach around basis points by yearend this is our best estimation if nothing change in our view of the macro scenario finally on capital i would like to highlight the strong organic generation in the quarter basis points the figure is mainly supported by ph our own net profit risk weighted asset management through securitizations mainly neutral ph intrafund dividend accrual on the back of the new dividend policy that you already know additionally we recorded basis points related to regulatory and modelrelated capital impact and another basis points mainly market performance all in all the core equity tier ratio increased by basis points to on a fully loaded basis very close to the maximum level of our range to the phasedin you have in the slide additionally i would like to comment on the solid results achieved by the group in the eba stress test in accordance with our expectations we outperformed clearly our peers that show that the resilience of our business model in scenarios ph the stressed scenarios so when we go to the ratios you have in the line the return on tangible equity progressing well eps is progressing well tangible net asset value per share is still progressing clearly also noteworthy is the return on risk weighted assets will reached versus one year ago well you already know our dividend policy once the ecb lifted the recommendation not to pay dividends well the board approved a payout at the of underlying profit we are in interim distribution ph of value of billion well half in cash half in buyback today around of the buyback program was already executed so this is where we are in this regard and in our dividend policy finally going to esg so as you know

higher than the sector average rates finally i would like to point out that our different esg initiatives have got significant external recognition along the year ill now hand over to josé to elaborate over the different business units and regions josé antonio garcía cantera group chief financial officer banco santander sa thank you josé antonio and good morning everyone like always i will start with a brief summary of the regions and then i will move into the main countries in the following slides europe we continue to grow our business while we advance ph in a common and more efficient operating model we had volume growth yearonyear and quarteronquarter in almost all markets and we expect these trends to continue in the coming quarters this led to revenues growing strongly at yearonyear and banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 as josé antonio mentioned outstanding cost management with a strong efficiency improvement and we also had a low cost of risk at basis points this in turn led to net operating income growth of and doubling of profits in north america we had accelerated volumes although us figures as i will explain later are affected by the disposals in the yearonyear comparison we had a strong profit growth yearonyear boosted by cost of credit improvement mainly in the us and revenue increase excluding disposals revenue total income was up return on tangible equity in north america was in south america we continue to strengthen our regional ties reflected in solid doubledigit customer and volume growth profit was up and return on tangible equity stood at in the digital consumer bank we saw strong profit growth in the third quarter leading to doubledigit growth year onyear as well now let me go into the main countries now in spain the stock of loans was flat in the quarter as mortgages offset the decrease in companies mortgages recorded the highest new business volumes in the last three years results in the third quarter were boosted by a strong net operating performance revenue rose in the quarter while costs dropped regarding provisions we remain cautious in spain but we expect the cost of risk in to be approximately half of that of yearonyear revenue grew mainly driven by net fee income especially in transactional and insurance products our cost reduction efforts were reflected in a sharp fall improvement efficiency by percentage points while loan loss provisions remain stable this obviously was reflected in the almost growth in profit we expect balance sheet trends to continue in the coming quarters which should lead to a stable net interest income while fee income could expand at midsingle digit rates cost should maintain its downward trend in the uk the main trends recorded in previous quarters continued net interest margin kept improving based on deposit repricing and volume growth the mortgage book grew as you can see in the slide downward trend in costs accelerated as our transformation program delivered savings partially offset by it investments and regulatory related programs as a result the efficiency ratio improved percentage points in the first nine months of the year we recorded another quarter of zero loan loss provisions return on tangible equity in the first nine months was like in spain we expect balance sheet trends to continue in the coming quarters assuming no hikes in rates net interest income should stabilize while fee income would grow at lowsingle digit rates we expect to reach a cost toincome below next year while the cost of risk should gradually normalize brazil closed another excellent quarter in terms of volumes profit and profitability we maintained strong growth rate in lending and reached a record high in card sales we gained million new customers just in the third quarter turning to results profit was almost higher yearonyear at billion and return on tangible equity increased to we had positive nii performance due to larger volumes as a slight increase in average interest rates while net fee income also grew in insurance and capital markets especially we reached record efficiency levels with cost up while inflation was up yearonyear loan loss provisions decreased sharply with a very positive cost of credit performance which fell to percentage point less than a year ago banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 in the coming quarters the structural doubledigit volume growth rates should be maintained which will continue to push up net interest income and fee income we expect to be able to keep costs growing below inflation and to maintain cost of risk at similar levels in the us the work conducted over the last several years allowed us to be uniquely positioned to benefit from current market conditions in volumes loan performance was impacted by bluestem portfolio disposal excluding perimeter growth was yearonyear with auto originations increasing versus the same period of last year customer funds showed a strong performance also growing yearonyear performance is affected by puerto rico and bluestem disposals so i will comment on the yearonyear results on a likeforlike basis net operating income increased on the back of resilient nii growth of strong auto leasing results and fee income at the same time provisions decreased sharply although we are starting to see signs of normalization were very proud to announce that this quarter santander us donated million to the santander consumer foundation in order to fund a multiyear program focused on transforming lives of low income students young adults and families across the country this program will target closing the digital divide enabling students and families in education programs to boost digital and financial competencies in addition in line with group strategy to deploy capital to the most profitable business and to accelerate growth in the us in the third quarter we announced two transactions that we have already shared with you the proposal to acquire all outstanding shares in santander consumer we dont own which is around and the agreement to acquire amherst pierpont securities both transactions are still subject to regulatory approvals in the coming quarters we expect highsingle digit growth in loans supported by consumer and cib revenue should continue to grow driven by doubledigit growth in nii while fees may contract slightly costtoincome is expected to remain at similar levels in mexico lending started to show signs of recovery in the quarter as individuals positive performance partially offset corporate loan normalization in the third quarter nii was favored by volume growth and higher interest rates while fee income ph performance was impacted by insurance seasonality in the second quarter and lower financial advisory fees costs were affected by inflation it projects and new outsourcing legislation in september cost of credit stood well below we expect nii plus fees to grow at highsingle digits next year while cost should increase below inflation and cost of risk should remain fairly stable in the digital consumer bank activity trends generally continue to improve new lending was higher year onyear however in the third quarter the microchip shortage hampered production and consequently the new auto market particularly in the first part of the quarter despite ease in terms of total income september was the best month of the yeartodate driving the strongest quarter since thanks to recovering fees in germany and a strong consumer lending and flat used vehicle volumes this together with volume cost and the srf contribution in the second quarter resulted in a increase quarteronquarter in underlying profits for the coming quarters we expect a strong cyclical growth in consumer finance demand costtoincome should remain below and cost of risk should gradually normalize banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 turning to the global businesses in corporate investment banking we held leading positions in the rankings of structured finance in europe and south america and dcm and ecm in most countries where we operate we are one of the world leaders in financing and advising on renewable energy outstanding third quarter results shown by revenues which was up yearonyear and the efficiency ratio remained a benchmark in this sector at below loan loss provisions started to normalize as well in wealth management total assets under management increased double digits yearoveryear commercial flows yeartodate in private banking and santander asset management reached billion these flows account for more than of total volume managed in insurance gross written premiums rose yearoveryear in summary total fee income generated which includes the part accounted for in the commercial networks grew and total contribution to the group profit increased yearoveryear now turning to pagonxt in nine months revenue increased yearonyear boosted by the strong jump in fees and at constant exchange rates we are clearly on track to achieve our expected second half revenue growth of close to versus the first half and to reach billion of revenue in the medium term now talking about the three components of pagonxt starting with merchant solutions getnet continued to deliver a significant growth the number of active merchants and total payments volume grew across all geographies getnet brazil continued to increase market share in the country reaching in total and over in e commerce we are developing an integrated offer for european customers with getnet europe and the integration of wirecards technology assets and talent acquired last january all in all we reached a total of million active merchants and a total payment volume of billion in the nine months up yearonyear in trade our initiatives to support our clients in international trend to expand beyond their domestic markets continue to evolve favorably onetrade already connects our customers in eight countries reaching active customers from in march an increase in the last six months ebury already has over corporate customers growing over new companies per month revenues growing at over versus the first quarter finally in consumer solutions superdigital began to operate in argentina in the third quarter so looking forward we expect revenue in pagonxt to continue to grow strongly in line with which puts us on track to achieve the billion revenue target in the medium term lastly we expect to reach more than million active merchants in the medium term and to finalize let me now go over the corporate centre underlying attributable loss of billion in the first nine months is higher than last year due to lower gains on financial transactions remember that we had positive foreign currency hedging results in on the other hand we have no material differences in nii and costs and significantly lower provisions due to charges in the first nine months of last year for certain holdings whose valuation was affected by the crisis and now let me turn it back to the ceo for his final remarks josé antonio álvarez álvarez vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 thank you josé once again i think we are presenting to you a solid results in the third quarter consistent across geographies and business and supported by the ph rorwa metrics volume growth that translate into higher revenue efficiency improvement credit is quality solid and better credit quality we continue to build capital and finally our return on tangible equity is now clearly higher than our cost of equity as a result of this strength and following the lifting of the decision of the ecb recommendation we resume our dividend policy and we continue to focus on improving our profitability while helping our customers and the society in general we aim to grow our customer base i should say keep growing our customer base strengthen the loyalty by improving their satisfaction help them in digitalization support them in financing and growing their businesses in a sustainable way with a positive impact for the whole society in short we are seeing a business normalization and our strength underpin our great confidence in our profitable growth ahead for that reason we are confident to continue to show progress towards our mediumterm target return on tangible equity as i said at the beginning of this presentation thank you very much for your attention and now we open the call for questions that you may have sergio gámez martínez global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa indeed thanks josé antonio so now we can proceed with the qa session first question question and answer section operator ph thank you sir thank you the first one is coming from the line of alvaro serrano from morgan stanley please proceed sir alvaro serrano q analyst morgan stanley co international plc good morning thanks for taking my questions my first question is on capital and maybe if you can provide some guidance and josé youve provided already quite a detailed guidance on the pl but on capital as we think about as well can you maybe give us some guidance on what remaining headwinds that we passed the bulk of the headwind now for several years or is there anything remaining and any thoughts on basel iv if thats an additional impact or not and then i had another question on costs youve given the billion sort of guidance you gave that billion costcutting guidance in europe costs in the group were slightly higher in the quarter i wonder if you can give us your thoughts on indiscernible and particularly in the uk and why is it proving so difficult to cut costs in the uk it feels like its been years now since weve been discussing the cost plans in the uk not delivering whats proving so difficult and do you think you can get to that billion target thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 okay i could address the cost issue and i pass to the cfo the capital question that if he can elaborate in more detail on the cost issue and particularly youre referring specifically to the cost cutting in europe we commit billion nominal reduction in closing the four core business spain uk portugal and poland we are progressing while in spain and portugal in uk we are a bit behind but i do think that we are at a running rate this year were going to be at a running rate of million nominal cost reduction and for next year well i remain confident that we can reach the billion cost cutting the lack in the uk is mainly due to some compliance investments that we are making and these forced us to make these investments but we remain committed to deliver the billion that we told you by josé antonio garcía cantera a group chief financial officer banco santander sa well with regards to capital so this year we dont expect any more regulatory charges for next year well have a small impact from minorities and we will have some impact from updating the models but this should be significantly smaller than the impacts we had in so we would expect to be at the upper end of the range throughout the year on basel iii sic basel iv well we need to see the final legislation weve seen a draft that was leaked a few days ago with ilm equal to if this is confirmed and the treatment of equity stakes and some other smaller changes the impact on santander is going to be very small as you know we will not be affected by the output floor so with ilm equal to and some other adjustments i think the impact will be really small sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thank you alvaro next question please operator thank you the next question is coming from the line of fernando gil de santivane sic santivañes from barclays please go ahead fernando gil de santivañes dornellas q analyst barclays capital securities ltd hi good morning thank you for taking my questions so the first question comes on spain nii and how do you see trends pricing and volumes going forward this would be one the other would be to touch a little bit on the us and how do you see the franchise long term without the agreement with fiat developing thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay nii in spain well lets talk where the market is right now we see a significant activity good activity in the individual space mortgage and consumer lending good activity in this front not that good in the corporate sector where the demand for trade is relatively low so the nii has been affected largely as we know very well by the level of euribor assuming that the euribor remained what it is with an nii that is going to be in line with what we are showing today so assuming that the euribor remains naturally ph we are the integrates are the balance sheet with the alco positions being very small ph or nonexistent is the position was higher rates banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 on the us you ask specific about the franchise ph scusa signed the franchise with the agreement of chrysler well chrysler the agreement expires in but this doesnt mean that we do not continue to do business with chrysler as you know chrysler bought indiscernible but is going to take for a while before they got they are able to underwrite the whole business particularly in the subprime and nearprime space where we are a real specialist and we expect to keep significant part of the business on top of that we are diversifying out of chrysler naturally we have now like three different providers one is what we call ph internally core business and it is the additional subprime that we generate in our own that is the bulk of the business and the other is chrysler in which we have the prime the nearprime and the subprime and the accounts from chrysler the prime normally we dispose of them or the majority of them and we keep normally the nearprime and subprime where we are a specialist going forward i do expect some impact from this but not being very significant and not change the dynamic of the franchise mainly taking into account that we are and for sure were going to get agreements with other originators be in digital originators as we are working already with them or be in traditional originators or other oems that may substitute some of the volumes we are getting now from chrysler sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks fernando next question please operator thank you the next one is coming from the line of francisco riquel from alantra please go ahead francisco riquel q analyst alantra equities sociedad de valores sa yes thank you for taking my questions first one is a general question about brazil the bank in brazil is performing very well delivering rote above however the macro risks are increasing with inflation running up north of concerns on fiscal spending driving indiscernible up gdp growth expectations revised down for so in this context the general question is how do you see the main kpis in brazil in the current macro environment mainly the indiscernible margins the costs and the cost of risk and the second question is about the other revenue lines if you can explain what do you more details on what you include here in this million in the third quarter particularly in spain which was much higher than expected and also in the consumer businesses and digital consumer bank in the us if you can comment also on the nature of these revenues whether they are recurrent or not thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay okay thank you for your question brazil you asked indiscernible question on brazil let me to make two starting points one we are performing well in brazil as you recognize on the back of market share gains we are gaining market share across the board but mainly in the retail space credit cards insurance businesses mainly those business that well on the lending side and there is a mix effect ph we are not growing that much at this stage now on the corporate side we are growing mainly in the retail banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 you mentioned a what you call i dont know how do you qualify the macro environment having higher risk on the back of the fiscal policy and all this is well the inflation indiscernible is naturally has been growing significantly on the back of this the central bank is increasing rate as you know and probably continue to do so and the prospects for the inflation are not is to come back a certain level is not different than the expectations we have in the mature markets that inflation now is running high and well come back in at some point you asked specifically a question how this affect our kpis going forward this macro environment and the cost of risk and all these things i do not expect a material impact in the cost of risk other than one reflected that comes from the mix yeah naturally the cost of risk as a total probably is going to be higher on the back of having the retail business growing in highdouble digit and the corporate business growing probably midsingle digit or a bit high but significantly lower than the other so other than these items you see a significant impact coming from this side the critical question here is our capacity to keep the momentum in the business and being a real market leader in the way we are doing the digital transformation so what our commercial activities is going very well and as a matter of fact we are about to reach million credit card sales per month that is a quite a number comparing that we were probably one year and a half ago two years ago in half of this million or less than so the growth we have high confidence in keeping our business momentum our commercial activity with good control operation naturally environment is going to be volatile because we face elections next year and some volatility may be expected around elections presidential elections next year and some measures could be taken looking at elections next year on the other revenue line mainly spain i think is equity method yeah so josé antonio garcía cantera a group chief financial officer banco santander sa under deposit guarantee and the contributions to the srf in the second quarter so its the volatility associated with both josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa so there are some businesses in that we account by equity method that are going back to normal and probably you should expect this line to keep growing yeah in a sustainable basis because those are business that well some of you know the ph merlins in spain and the likes that you know that well given the economic scenario we expect this to keep growing in the coming years sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks paco next question please operator thank you the next one is from the line of adrian cighi from credit suisse please go ahead adrian cighi q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 hi there good morning adrian cighi from credit suisse two followup questions from my side one on brazil and one on capital on brazil we see nii increase in the quarter by in euro terms my understanding is that the first year impact of rate increases which you reiterate again is a negative impact of million from basis points rate increase this year the central bank has increased rates by over basis points are we seeing the impact of these increased rates in these results ie is the underlying results even stronger or are these rate increase impacts somewhat delayed and should we expect them in the coming quarters were clearly in the middle of a very aggressive cycle so any insight on how the timing and quantum of impacts from these would be much appreciated sticking with brazil weve seen some pretty big moves in fx in recent weeks can you update us where your hedging is on this and briefly on capital you had 17basispoint headwinds in the market and others can you give us any color as to what drove this given that there are some relatively limited spread movement this quarter thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay allow me to take first the question in brazil i will pass ph hedge question to the cfo and i will elaborate also on the ph capital changes to market brazil you ill say while we have a negative impact when the rate goes up thats true in the short run in one year its minus million or basis points we increased ph you said we see the rates increasing basis points thats true but when you look at the numbers and the volumes what you see is the volumes in retail with very high margins growing close to okay the mix effect is very strong we translate this into growth in nii we are missing here likeforlike we should be growing the margin in the region of close to yearonyear we are growing and partially due to this increase in rates that you rightly pointed that affect us in a negative way i should say that the million is on one year probably you take this quarteronquarter the impact is more negative at the beginning and less negative as the time goes and we are able to ph reappreciate assets and liabilities but the effect that you mentioned is due to this i pass the question ph to hedge the capital the market is basically marktomarket at a value of for sale portfolio the impacts we have had in brazil mexico ph somehow and us yeah so josé antonio garcía cantera a group chief financial officer banco santander sa the three josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa yeah josé antonio garcía cantera a group chief financial officer banco santander sa no yeah the three largest impact in terms of the availableforsale portfolio have been poland banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa yeah josé antonio garcía cantera a group chief financial officer banco santander sa brazil and chile in the region of million each from the beginning of the year so this explains basically the impact on capital in terms of the hedging well we continue to hedge the capital ratio so fx movements do not affect the capital ratio and we continue to hedge expected profits of when we think that the market is running ahead of itself so now we have some currencies already hedged for next year and again this is tactically and it depends on our view of the market relative to what the market expects but again the most important is the hedging of capital which we continue to do so the ratio continues to be fully hedged sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks adrian next question please operator thank you the next one is coming from the line of sofie peterzens from jpmorgan please go ahead sofie peterzens q analyst jpmorgan securities plc yeah hi yeah its sofie from jpmorgan so just had two followup questions just the first one going back to brazil net interest income i get that you have the mix effect but if i look at the loan growth in brazilian terms loan growth was up only quarteronquarter in the third quarter but net interest income was up quarteron quarter in brazil i was wondering did you have any increased alco performance in brazil or something else thats going to help the net interest income in brazil or it is purely the mix effect and then my second question would also be a followup question i recognized that on the regulatory front you were saying that next year the regulatory impact will be less but could you just remind us how much all the minorities are amherst pierpont is there anything else that we should be aware of in terms of indiscernible equity tier impact outside the regulatory impacts thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay im going to brazil the other issue on top of the mix and the different path of growth between retail and corporate business is the alco portfolio yeah so naturally as the alco portfolio now is much smaller than niis much smaller than it was and even the size is smaller and the spread the spread is smaller so those are the two components yeah so this yeah so no more than that on the regulatory front i pass the question to josé josé antonio garcía cantera a group chief financial officer banco santander sa banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 so this year we have the well again this is subject to regulatory approval still but the amherst pierpont impact will be around basis points the buyback of scusa minorities will be basis points if we get the regulatory approvals before the yearend we will account for those this year in terms of pure regulatory charges next year the change in the accounting of minorities will be another basis points next year which is the only significant regulatory impact that we expect next year on top of that again we will have new models which could cost us a bit of capital but again when we look at the sum of regulatory plus models next year relative to will be significantly smaller sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks sofie next question please operator thank you the next one is coming from the line of carlos cobo catena from société générale please go ahead carlos cobo catena q analyst société générale sa spain hi hello thank you for the presentation have a couple of questions one is on stellantis youve already touched on the impact in europe but its really reported that they are in the process of reassessing partnerships in europe and i was wondering if you could explain a little bit on that from where are you in the negotiations and if theres any did you see any risk of losing some of those joint ventures or any of the part of relationship with them and secondly if you have considered a different approach to capital allocation in the group and if not why not because running with a tight capital ratio versus the market perception could be preventing the stock from really ph rerating further and perhaps unlocking some capital somewhere else in the group even if indiscernible earnings could help you to run with a more comfortable capital buffer that the market may reward and if you dont agree with that view why is that itd be nice i know its an open question but itll be good to hear your thoughts thank you very much josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay taking the question the first one stellantis the partnership in europe naturally we are talking to them and well we are i would say fairly optimistic on continuing the existing relationship and ph may be the case that we continue to be the preferred partner for them or i do expect to be continued to be the preferred partner for them in the coming years so i do not expect any material change on this if any i think it should be positive and on the back of the performance of the joint ventures yeah so its not other thing so when we started the joint ventures with them the joint ventures were making million net profit now they are making more than million net profit on the back of this excellent outstanding performance and we expect this to continue going forward you mentioned capital well our view is different so the board took the position our target on capital is and well you say more comfortable im comfortable with the capital were going to be we are close to the upper end of the range and are absolutely comfortable with these for two reasons yeah when i look at the banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 market i look at the credit side our cds is the lowest in europe yeah among the largest bank so from the credit standpoint of view no need when you look at their stress test our score in the stress test is by far lower under the stress test scenario so thats sustained our view why we should be in the and we are already at the upper end of the range and we plan to remain there yeah and we will be at the end of the year and next year we will be around this so thats the view and josé you want to add something josé antonio garcía cantera a group chief financial officer banco santander sa yeah no just a couple of comments amongst the largest banks in europe we are the bank with the lowest capital requirement of all and our mda cet1 buffer stands today at basis points so being capitalscarce resource and the most expensive one i think josé antonio has said it all but again we are the bank with the lowest capital requirement amongst the largest in europe sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks for the question carlos next one operator thank you the next one is coming from the line of daragh quinn from kbw please go ahead daragh quinn q analyst kbw hi good morning thanks for taking my question one just clarification on the comments you made on the cost of risk into  and i think you mentioned a release of provisions and that that would lower the provision charge if i understood correctly to basis points for the full year compared to basis points as of september so i just wanted to clarify that and then just maybe again on capital youve indicated youre at the high end of your range not expecting too much change on that in  but with lower regulatory headwinds in and given your guidance on profitability im just wondering maybe can you not be more specific on why the cet1 ratio wouldnt be moving above that range that youve given or is it that those higher profits are being offset by higher rwa growth thanks josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay lets address the two questions the first one is the cost of risk i said in the presentation that we need to update our macro scenario the overlay that we made last year remains in the balance sheet at and this in the region of billion has two components one is coming from the macro scenario the other one comes from qualitative assessment of the different portfolios when we update the macro scenario in the fourth quarter i dont have the ph current number but i guess that the majority of the provision related with the macro scenario in the region of million to billion may be released in the fourth quarter assuming that the scenario is what we have in mind right now and this will lead to the cost of risk in the whole year in the region of basis points that i mentioned before the second question is on capital well when we look at the capital we have a range that we and the board and within that is the right range for the bank for the perception we have about the risk that the bank is facing and banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 remember that looking forward naturally you mentioned risk weighted assets and potential capital ratio going beyond this may happen naturally because the capital generation given our expectations on the return on tangible equity is going to be significant at the same time we continue to see the bank as we expect to grow so i do expect in the emerging markets to keep deploying capital growing the business while i dont see any reason why we shouldnt grow in latin america more than a year in europe probably less so and on average having a risk weighted assets growth on the region of i dont know higher than the one we have had in the last two or three years and well if we are right our return on tangible equity in the region of to allow us to ph combine a pay a healthy dividend and at the same time to grow the risk weighted assets significantly more than we did and finally we are not growing a lot the space and naturally the ratio will grow beyond the and in that case its up to the board to take the appropriate decisions in relation with capital but to me the capital we have still some regulatory and models indiscernible in beyond basel iii for us is not an issue at all we dont have impact of the output floor if the ph alm comes equal to one operational risk is not going to be an issue for us and i will say we will have a clear sky to navigate in with a risk weighted asset growth in the region of medium to highsingledigit growing and rewarding having a consistent dividend policy that our shareholders particularly retail ones like very much ph too with paying cash yeah sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks for the question daragh next one please next question operator thank you the next one is from mario ropero indiscernible from bestinver securities please go ahead mario ropero q analyst bestinver hi good morning my first question is related to nii in spain you mentioned that you expect nii stability going forward what are the assumptions regarding indiscernible embedded in this stability for nii in spain are you assuming that the current conditions will remain in place for the whole year and then a more general question on the return target i know that you have a midterm time guideline for the target would it be possible to give some indication for next year perhaps on the rote target or maybe if you can give us some indication about whether you expect rote to continue improving versus yeah level thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa so nii in spain the conditions we are assuming are the current ones so i am not assuming a increase in rates in the cards so im assuming that we navigate more or less on average with the same level that this year you know the euribor one year is the one who has the largest impact well not only okay so in general as you know we dont have alco positions in spain so our position to higher rates is pretty pretty strong probably the strongest banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 we have had in many many years but what is on the back of my projections is and rates being similar to if those are lower it affects my projection if those are higher it will be up big big positive return on tangible equity i do expect that return on tangible equity in being higher than the one in yeah so its not our policy at this point to give guidance to you but while you can project easily you see trends in our business and some indications that we gave you particularly on provision in spain where the cost of risk is going to be significantly significantly lower and josé already gave you an indication of where we expect to navigate on this you can make your own numbers and you get easily into what may be the development of the group next year yeah but ph for sure i do expect higher return on tangible equity in than in sergio gámez martínez a global headshareholder investor relations banco santander sa thanks mario next question operator thank you the next one is from andrea filtri from mediobanca please go ahead andrea filtri q analyst mediobanca spa united kingdom thank you for taking my questions you have given some detail on the reversals you expect lower ph late provisions can you tell us where you expect them and i may have missed if you have given indications on guidance on where the cost of risk outlook is going in the us i dont know if you could share with us if you expect any impact from ifrs implementation ph and next on capital is the impact from the implementation of the addendum rules over with what youve taken this quarter and from the important securitization activity that youre having should we expect a negative impact in the future on nii thank you josé antonio álvarez álvarez a vice chairman chief executive officer banco santander sa okay the guidance cost of risk in spain were particularly less in spain this year weve been oh sorry i dont know if you were hear me i dont know the mic was off or on sorry the guidance of cost of risk in spain we expect lower cost of risk in the sme space i made these comments in the previous quarters that we were taking a prudent view on the sme portfolio in spain so as youve seen weve been building a significant amount of provisions this year in relation with all the events that have happened around the pandemia and on all the lending related with smes and we expect this to come materially down next year once we feel comfortable with what the evolution of the macro and the expected losses that we have already in our balance sheet for future expected events on the credit side you mentioned also the us cost of risk the us cost of risk this year was starting ph at low this next year is going to go up its not going to go up at the levels weve seen before because still the environment is helpful and the situation of the motor industry with the used car price being at very high levels probably make us to be more optimistic than what is the average across the cycle for but its going to go up no doubt compared with this year banco santander sa san corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2021 you mentioned securitization being negative securitization we use this traditionally as a tool of funding in the last two or three years its a combination of funding plus capital so the market is in a situation in which we are doing securitizations and release capital at incredibly low implicit cost of equity as low as or something like that yeah if the market remains in this situation probably were going to be relatively or very active in securitizations particularly on the consumer portfolios where the market is eager to buy this kind of portfolios and implicit capital costs when new securitization is extremely low its not the same for all the assets josé you want to add something josé antonio garcía cantera a group chief financial officer banco santander sa yeah in terms of ias that refers to leases if i understand correctly and we are not aware that there will be any changes to this but we will look into it and get back to you but no changes as far as we know related to the leasing accounting thank you sergio gámez martínez global
