the current outbreak of covid19 has materially impacted our business and the continuance of this pandemic or any future outbreak of any other highly contagious diseases or other public health emergency could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations due to the unpredictable and rapidly changing nature of this outbreak and the resulting economic distress it is not possible to determine with certainty the ultimate impact on our results of operations or whether other currently unanticipated consequences of the pandemic are reasonably likely to materially affect our results of operations however certain adverse effects have already occurred or are probable the following summarizes our current discussion of the impacts of covid19 on the companys current financial and operating status as well as on its future operational and financial planning as of the date hereof impact on workforce the health and wellbeing of our colleagues and customers are a top priority for the company the company has implemented business continuity plans and has followed guidelines issued by government authorities regarding social distancing and workfromhome arrangements currently approximately of the workforce continues to work from home in addition the company has established a temporary emergency paid leave program that provides employees with up to hours of additional paid time off to use either continuously or intermittently and before exhausting other paid time off to assist with dependent care needs related to covid19 further the company provided a week in pay premiums for frontline customer support workers to help defray additional costs incurred while working during the pandemic while our business continuity plans are in place if significant portions of our workforce our subsidiaries workforces or our vendors workforces are unable to work effectively as a result of the covid19 outbreak including because of illness stayathome orders facility closures reductions in services or hours of operation or ineffective remote work arrangements there may be disruptions to our origination and servicing operations which could result in reduced originations andor collection effectiveness or impair our or our subsidiaries ability to operate our businesses and satisfy obligations under thirdparty servicing agreements each of these scenarios could have materially adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impact on services the covid19 outbreak as well as state stayathome orders resulted in the closure of certain branches in highly affected areas within the banks footprint to comply with social distancing guidelines and help minimize the spread of the coronavirus the bank instituted temporary changes to how it operates including closure of certain branches and limitations on services provided to others certain limited service locations were only performing teller transactions such as depositing and cashing checks and handling requests for cash withdrawals money orders and cashiers checks in the lobby or at the drivethrough in addition some branches were only providing account opening and servicing with a banker by appointment only full and limitedservice branches are limiting the number of people allowed in our locations at one time branch hours have been changed temporarily with certain branches providing special hours for highrisk customers as the quarter wore on and states changed their guidance the bank has resumed normal branch operations for over of its current branches while maintaining applicable social distancing guidelines retail customers are encouraged to take advantage of mobile and online banking enabling customers to bank anytime anywhere for services including checking account balances remote check deposit transfers bill pay and more retail customers can also utilize automated services via phone to make balance and transaction inquiries payments on loans transfers between accounts stop payments and more our call center remains staffed and open seven days a week to better serve our customers business customers can continue to utilize the business mobile banking application and business online banking to minimize the need to go to branches or exchange cash we have developed the business first coronavirus resource page for our business customers during this time impact on customers and loan and lease performance the covid19 outbreak and associated economic crisis have led to negative effects on our customers unlike the regional impact of natural disasters such as hurricanes the covid19 outbreak is impacting customers nationwide and is expected to have a materially more significant impact on the performance of our loan and lease portfolios than even the most severe historical natural disaster closures and disruptions to businesses in the united states have led to negative effects on our customers similar to many other financial institutions we have taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate our customers covid19related economic challenges the company is actively working with its borrowers who have been impacted by covid19 this unique and evolving situation has created temporary personal and financial challenges for our retail and commercial borrowers the company is working prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of covid19 and has developed loan modification and deferral programs to mitigate the adverse effects of covid19 to our loan customers we have experienced a sharp increase in requests for extensions and modifications related to covid19 nationwide and a significant number of such extensions and modifications have been granted the bank also permitted fee reversals for those customers impacted by covid19 even if the amount exceed the allowable courtesy fee reversal the bank also joined other us banks in providing overdrawn customers full access to their eip by providing a temporary credit in the amount of their overdrawn balance as of the end of the day prior to receipt of the eip up to a limit of to date the bank has provided over million in temporary credits helping nearly customers beginning july the bank began removing these temporary credits from customers accounts these customer support programs by their nature are expected to negatively impact our financial performance and other results of operations in the near term our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected in the longer term if the covid19 outbreak leads us to continue to provide such programs for a significant period of time if the number of customers experiencing hardship related directly or indirectly to the outbreak of covid19 increases or if our customer support programs are not effective in mitigating the effects of covid19 on our customers financial situations given the unpredictable nature of this situation the nature and extent of such effects cannot be predicted at this time in addition to the measures discussed above the bank is providing assistance for its retail customers including helping those experiencing difficulties with loan payments waiving fees for early cd withdrawals refunding late payment and overdraft fees offering credit card limit increases and increasing cash availability limits at atms the policy of a more relaxed approach to providing fee refunds in the wake of hardship caused by the covid19 pandemic remains but beginning in august the bank began to see fewer refund requests as a result fee reversals are approaching prepandemic levels for business banking customers the bank is working with customers in offering interestonly loan accommodations and deferrals and extensions up to days for customers and deferrals up to days for sba loan customers experiencing hardships item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the ppp a key part of the cares act authorizes loans to small businesses to help meet payroll costs and pay other eligible expenses during the covid19 outbreak the program is administered by the sba and the loans and accrued interest are forgivable as long as the borrower uses at least of the proceeds of the loan for eligible purposes such as payroll benefits rent and utilities and maintains employee and payroll levels the original funding for the ppp was fully allocated by midapril with additional funding made available on april original loans were originated with a twoyear maturity unless extended by mutual agreement between the lender and borrower loans made on or after june have a fiveyear maturity in july the ppp was extended through august the bank originated loans in the first and second rounds of ppp to date sbna has assisted more than business customers in receiving ppp loans for more than billion in funding sbna launched a pilot of the ppp loan forgiveness application on august the ppp loan forgiveness application process and platform are in pilot and are currently being enhanced to account for guidance released by the us treasury and the sba on october related to ppp loans under impact on originations including the relationship with fca since the covid19 outbreak sc has partnered with fca to la unch new incentive programs including implementing day first payment deferrals and a annual percentage rate for months on select fca models today all dealers are open and operating at full capacity however many are operating with a different business model eg appointments only home delivery etc third party sources are reporting a new car seasonally adjusted annual rate that is approximately of precovid expectations while an economic downturn associated with the pandemic will impact sales most dealers have developed business models that will allow them to continue operation in some capacity while banking is considered an essential business in all of the banks footprint states executive orders have limited the scope of work of vendors supporting mortgage and home equity lines of credit such as appraisers notaries law firms title companies and settlement agents or stopped these vendors from working altogether as a result of these restrictions the number of mortgages home equity lines of credit and refinancings dec lined for a period in certain states while many of these restrictions have been lifted it remains difficult to estimate the overall negative impact these limitations will have on mortgages home equity lines of credits and refinancing as restrictions may be reinstated with rising covid19 numbers in the upcoming months impact on operations government and regulatory authorities could also implement laws regulations executive orders and other guidance that allow customers to forgo making scheduled payments for some period of time require modifications to receivables eg waiving accrued interest preclude creditors from exercising certain rights or taking certain actions with respect to collateral including repossession or liquidation of collateral or mandate limited operations or temporary closures of the company or our vendors as nonessential businesses or otherwise while we have business continuity plans in place if significant portions of our or our vendors workforces are unable to work effectively as a result of the covid19 pandemic including because of illness stayathome orders facility closures reductions in services or hours of operation or ineffective remote work arrangements there may be servicing disruptions which could result in reduced collection effectiveness or our ability to operate our business and satisfy our obligations under our thirdparty servicing agreements each of these scenarios could have negative effects on our business financial condition and results of operations item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impact on debt and liquidity as international trade and business activity has slowed and supply chains have been disrupted global credit and financial markets have recently experienced and may continue to experience significant disruption and volatility during the first and second quarters of particularly financial markets experienced significant declines and volatility and such market conditions may continue andor precede recessionary conditions in the us economy under these circumstances we may experience some or all of the risks related to market volatility and recessionary conditions described under the caption we are vulnerable to disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets in the risk factors section of our form 10k governmental and regulatory authorities have recently implemented fiscal and monetary policies and initiatives to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on the economy and individual businesses and households such as the reduction of the federal reserves benchmark interest rate to near zero in march further the federal reserves talf is available if necessary to support investment in scs eligible abs bonds however the company does not expect to need to utilize talf given recent tightening in abs credit spreads these governmental and regulatory actions may not be successful in mitigating the adverse economic effects of covid19 and could affect our net interest income and reduce our profitability sustained adverse economic effects from the outbreak may also result in downgrades in our credit ratings or adversely affect the interest rate environment if our access to funding is reduced or if our costs to obtain such funding significantly increases our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected the companys liquidity comes from several primary sources outlined in the liquidity and capital resources section of this mda including deposits as well as public and financing a ctivities during the quarter there were no unsecured debt issuances executed by shusa during the third quarter sbna maintained ample liquidity driven by stable deposits whereby maturing fhlb advances and brokered cds were not renewed resulting in lower outstanding balances for both products as a result there was minimal new wholesale funding activity at sbna over the quarter limited to a million brokered cd issuance in august and million of additional fhlb advances in september in addition to significant amounts of liquidity from warehouse lines and affiliate lines of credit sc successfully continued to access the abs market in the quarter during the quarter sc completed onbalance sheet funding transactions totaling approximately billion including private amortizing lease facilities for approximately billion two securitizations on its sdart platform for approximately billion and a billion unsecured debt issuance with santander however due to the evolving nature of the covid19 outbreak it is not possible to predict whether unanticipated consequences of the pandemic will materially affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future impact on dividends historically the company made dividend payments to santander and received dividends from the bank and other ihc entities the amount and size of any future dividends however will be subject to various factors including the companys capital and liquidity positions regulatory considerations impacts related to the covid19 outbreak any accounting standards that affect capital or liquidity including cecl financial and operational performance alternative uses of capital and general market conditions and may be changed or suspended at any time impact on impairment of goodwill indefinitelived and longlived assets the company has analyzed the impact of covid19 on its financial statements including the potential for impairment as a result of this analysis the company has recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion during the second quarter of the analysis did not indicate any impairment for the companys loan and lease portfolios leased vehicles rou assets or other nonfinancial assets such as upfront fees or other intangibles impact on communities the company is committed to supporting our communities impacted by the covid19 pandemic and the companys nonprofit foundation has begun responding to the covid19 crisis with thousand in donations to a select group of organizations addressing community issues in addition shusas ongoing support for nonprofit partners providing essential services in our communities includes million in charitable giving this year further shusa will provide million in financing to community development financial institutions to fund small business loans and will expedite grant funding and payments where possible to help sustain nonprofit operations during this time item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory matters the activities of the company and its subsidiaries including the bank and sc are subject to regulation under various us federal laws

the payment of dividends including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain wellcapitalized under prompt corrective action regulations a s a consolidated subsidiary of the company sc is included in various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends as described under the caption stress tests and capital planning in this section refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of this mda for detail of the capital actions of the company and its subsidiaries during the period in june the federal reserve announced that due to the economic uncertainty resulting from covid19 it will require all large banks including shusa to update and resubmit their capital plans under new scenarios by november in addition the federal reserve issued the interim policy which includes a cap on common stock dividends that cannot exceed the average of the trailing four quarters net income and a prohibition on share repurchases the interim policy applied to the third quarter of and was extended into the fourth quarter by the federal reserve based on the interim policy and the companys expected average trailing four quarters of net income the company and sc are prohibited from paying dividends in the third quarter of sc is consolidated into shusas capital plan and therefore is subject to the interim policy that utilizes shusas average trailing income to determine the cap on common stock dividends shusa requested an exception to the interim policy for sc to be able to pay dividends of up to per share in the third quarter of the federal reserve granted this request and on july scs board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of sc common stock payable to shareholders of record as of august this dividend was paid on august sc does not currently expect to declare or pay a dividend in the fourth quarter of fbos in february the federal reserve issued the final rule implementing certain eps mandated by the dfa under the final rule fbos with over billion of us nonbranch assets including santander were required to consolidate us subsidiary activities under an ihc in addition the final rule required us bhcs and fbos with at least billion in total us consolidated nonbranch assets to be subject to eps and heightened capital liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements due to both its global and us nonbranch total consolidated asset size santander was subject to both of the above provisions of the final rule as a result of this rule santander has transferred substantially all of its us bank and nonbank subsidiaries previously outside the company to the company which became an ihc effective july economic growth act in may the economic growth act was signed into law the economic growth act scales back certain requirements of the dfa in october the federal reserve finalized a rulemaking implementing the changes required by the economic growth act the rulemaking provides a tailored approach to the eps mandated by section of the dfa under the new tailored approach banks are placed into different categories based on asset size crossjurisdictional activity reliance on shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets and offbalance sheet exposure the tailoring rule applies to both santander and the company both santander and the company were placed into category four of the tailoring rule the new tailored standards are discussed further below item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory capital requirements us basel iii regulatory capital rules are applicable to both shusa and the bank and establish a comprehensive capital framework that includes both the advanced approaches for the largest internationally active us banks formerly known as basel ii and a standardized approach that applies to all banking organizations with over million in assets these rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum riskbased capital ratios and prompt corrective action thresholds that require banking organizations including the company and the bank to maintain a minimum cet1 capital ratio of a tier capital ratio of a total capital ratio of and a minimum leverage ratio calculated as the ratio of tier capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter of a further capital conservation buffer of above these minimum ratios was phased in effective january this buffer is required for banking institutions and bhcs to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions including paying dividends these us basel iii regulatory capital rules include deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that msrs and deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income are deducted from cet1 to the extent any one such category exceeds of cet1 implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 for the company and the bank began on january and was initially planned over three years with a fully phasedin requirement of january however during the regulatory agencies finalized changes to the capital rules that became effective on january these changes extended the current treatment and deferred the final transition provision phasein at nonadvanced approach institutions for certain capital elements and suspended the risk weight to percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital in lieu of advancing to percent during the regulatory agencies approved a final rule which includes simplifications for nonadvanced approaches to the generally applicable capital rules specifically with regard to the treatment of minority interest as well as modifying the riskweight to percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital this final rule became effective on april as described in our annual report on form 10k for on january we adopted the cecl standard which upon adoption resulted in a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance net of income tax and an increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately billion as also described in our form 10k the us banking agencies in december approved a final rule to address the impact of cecl on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations including the company the option to phase in the dayone impact of cecl until the first quarter of in march the us banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of cecls effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodologys effect on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period the company has elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the december rule see the bank regulatory capital section of this mda for the companys capital ratios under basel iii standards the implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the companys regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the company if capital has reached the significantly or critically undercapitalized levels further material restrictions can be imposed including restrictions on interest payable on accounts dismissal of management and in critically undercapitalized situations appointment of a receiver or conservator critically undercapitalized institutions generally may not beginning days after becoming critically undercapitalized make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt all but wellcapitalized institutions are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvements act and occ regulations institutions which are not categorized as wellcapitalized or adequatelycapitalized are restricted from making capital distributions which include cash dividends stock redemptions or repurchases cash out mergers interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution at september the bank met the criteria to be classified as wellcapitalized item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on march the federal reserve adopted a final rule to simplify capital rules for large banks under the final rule firms supervisory stress test results are now used to establish the size of the scb requirement replacing the of riskweighted assets component under the prior capital conservation buffer requirement the scb is calculated as the maximum decline in cet1 in the severely adverse scenario subject to a floor plus four quarters of dividends the rule results in new regulatory capital minimums which are equal to of cet1 plus the scb any gsib surcharge and any countercyclical capital buffer the gsib buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to shusa in the event a firm falls below its new minimums the rule imposes restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses firms continue to submit a capital plan annually supervisory expectations for capital planning processes do not change under the proposal the company does not expect this rule to have a material impact on its current or future planned capital actions stress testing and capital planning in october the federal reserve issued rules that tailor the stress testing a company is required to perform based on the companys asset size crossjurisdictional activity reliance on shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets and offbalance sheet ex posure in march the federal reserve amended and simplified its capital planning rules and introduced the scb to more closely align individual firm capital requirements to the firms risk profile the scb uses the results from the federal reserves supervisory stress tests which are one component of the ccar to help determine each firms capital requirements for the coming year on august the federal reserve announced the individual large bank capital requirements shusas cet1 scb is resulting in a cet1 capital requirement under the revised rules the simplified scb rule was effective on october but has been superseded temporarily in the third and fourth quarter of by the interim policy which limits distributions as described above under payment of dividends on october the federal reserve proposed amendments to capital planning and stress testing requirements for large bhcs under the proposal as a category iv firm under the supervisory tailoring rule shusa would be required to submit a capital plan on an annual basis but would generally no longer be required to utilize the scenarios provided by the federal reserve the company continues to evaluate planned capital actions in its annual capital plan and on an ongoing basis liquidity rules the federal reserve the fdic and the occ have established a rule to implement the basel iii lcr for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies and a modified version of the lcr for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active the lcr is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30day time horizon smaller covered companies more than billion in assets such as the company were required to calculate the lcr monthly beginning january in october the federal reserve finalized rules that tailor the liquidity requirements based on a companys asset size crossjurisdictional activity reliance on shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets and offbalance sheet exposure in light of the fact that the company is under billion in assets and has less than billion in shortterm wholesale funding the company is no longer required to disclose the us lcr item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in october the joint agencies published the final rule for the nsfr the nsfr is designed to encourage more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a oneyear time horizon the metric requires large banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on and offbalance sheet activities thereby reducing the likelihood that disruptions to a banks regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity in a way that could increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress similar to the aforementioned criteria used to determine us lcr reporting requirements the final nsfr rule would not be applicable to the company based upon its size and risk profile resolution planning the dfa requires the company to prepare and regularly update resolution plans the 165d resolution plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the us bankruptcy code and that no extraordinary support is received from the us or any other government the most recent 165d resolution plan was submitted to the federal reserve and fdic in december in addition under amended federal deposit insurance corporation improvements act rules the idi resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors rapid access to their insured deposits maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution the most recent idi resolution plan was submitted to the fdic in june tlac the tlac rule requires certain us organizations to maintain a minimum amount of lossabsorbing instruments including a minimum amount of unsecured ltd the tlac rule applies to us gsibs and to ihcs with billion or more in us nonbranch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important fbo the company is such an ihc under the tlac rule companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of tlac which consists of a minimum amount of ltd and tier capital as a result shusa must hold the higher of of its rwas or of its total consolidated assets in the form of tlac of which of its rwas or of total consolidated assets must consist of ltd in addition shusa must maintain a tlac buffer composed solely of cet1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the tlac buffer it maintains the tlac rule became effective on january volcker rule the dfa added new section to the bhca which is commonly referred to as the volcker rule the volcker rule prohibits a banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a covered fund i acquiring or retaining any equity partnership or other ownership interest in the covered fund ii controlling the covered fund or iii engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the covered fund these prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities because the term banking entity includes an idi a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates the volcker rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as santander the company and certain of the companys subsidiaries including the bank and sc as well as other santander subsidiaries in the united states and abroad the company implemented certain policies and procedures training programs recordkeeping internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the volcker rule as required by the volcker rule the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and covered fund activities shusas compliance program includes among other things processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the volcker rule testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule in october the joint agencies responsible for administering the volcker rule finalized revisions to volcker rule the final rule tailors the volcker rules compliance requirements to the amount of a firms trading activity revise the definition of a trading account clarify certain key provisions in the volcker rule and simplify the information companies are required to provide the banking agencies the company is in the process of transitioning to the requirements of this revised rule item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in july the joint agencies finalized a rule that revised the volcker rule further the revisions provide an exemption for activities of qualifying foreign excluded funds revise the exclusions from the definition of a covered fund create new exclusions from the definition of a covered fund and modify the definition of an ownership interest the new rule became effective on october and the company is in the process of transitioning to the requirements of this revised rule risk retention rule in december the federal reserve issued its final credit risk retention rule which generally requires sponsors of abs to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing abs shusa primarily through sc is an active participant in the structured finance markets and began to comply with the retention requirements effective in december market risk rule the market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold riskbased regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions the bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internalrisk based models the market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the banks internal risk based models as well as qualitative requirements for the banks management of market risk banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions a bank is subject to the market risk capital rules if its consolidated trading activity defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its ffiec and fr y for the previous quarter equals the lesser of percent or more of the banks total assets as reported in its call report and fr y for the previous quarter or billion or more at september sbna reported aggregate trading exposure in excess of the market risk threshold and as a result both the company and sbna began holding the market risk component within rwas of the riskbased capital ratios and submitted the ffiec market risk regulatory report beginning for the period ended december the incorporation of market risk within regulatory capital has resulted in a decrease in the riskbased capital ratios capital simplification rule the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule that simplifies for nonadvanced approaches banking organizations the generally applicable capital rules and makes a number of technical corrections specifically it reverses the previous transition provision freeze on msrs and

portfolios for which fico is not considered in the alll model while underwriting guidelines are designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers additionally higher unemployment rates higher gasoline prices unstable real estate values resets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates the general availability of consumer credit and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies defaults and repossessions as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default because scs historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers the actual rates of delinquencies defaults repossessions and losses on these loans could be more dramatically

from december to september most significantly within the rics and auto loan portfolio which decreased billion delinquent balances and nonaccrual balances overall were lower as of september primarily due to the large number of deferrals granted to borrowers impacted by covid19 tdrs tdrs are loans that have been modified as the company has agreed to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans tdrs occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower the types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions limitations on accrued interest charged term extensions and deferments of principal tdrs are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon modification unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification for most portfolios tdrs may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance as long as the company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full ric tdrs are placed on nonaccrual status when the company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured and at the latest when the account becomes more than dpd ric tdrs are considered for return to accrual when the account becomes days or less past due to the extent the tdr is determined to be collateraldependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing

payments on tdrs tdrs end of period new tdrs includes drawdowns on lines of credit that have previously been classified as tdrs the decrease in total delinquent tdrs is primarily due to the significant increase in deferrals provided to borrowers in response to covid19 impacts in accordance with the companys policies and guidelines the company may offer extensions deferrals to consumers on its rics whereby the consumer is allowed to move a maximum of three payments per event to the end of the loan the companys policies and guidelines limit the frequency of each new deferral that may be granted to one deferral every six months regardless of the length of any prior deferral the maximum number of lifetime months extended for all automobile rics was eight while some marine and rv contracts had a maximum of twelve months extended to reflect their longer term additionally the company generally limits the granting of deferrals on new accounts until a requisite number of payments has been received however many of these practices have been temporarily revised to accommodate borrowers impacted by covid19 including increasing the maximum number of extensions allowing more than one deferral every six months and removing the requirement that a requisite number of months have passed since origination during the deferral period the company continues to accrue and collect interest on the loan in accordance with the terms of the deferral agreement at the time a deferral is granted all delinquent amounts may be deferred or paid this may result in the classification of the loan as current and therefore not considered a delinquent account however there are other instances when a deferral is granted but the loan is not brought completely current such as when the account days past due is greater than the deferment period granted such accounts are aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account historically the majority of deferrals on rics are approved for borrowers who are either or dpd and these borrowers are typically reported as current after deferral for the ric portfolio if a customer receives two or more deferrals over the life of the loan the loan would generally advance to a tdr designation however in march the federal banking agencies issued an interagency statement on loan modifications and reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the coronavirus this guidance encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers that may be unable to meet their contractual obligations because of the effects of covid19 and concludes that shortterm modifications eg six months made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were impacted by covid19 and who were less than days past due as of the implementation date of a relief program are not tdrs additionally section of the cares act grants companies the option of not applying the gaap tdr guidance to certain loans with covid19 modifications in march the company began actively working with its borrowers impacted by covid19 and provided loan modification programs to mitigate the adverse effects of covid19 in both its consumer and commercial portfolios the programs generally include payment deferrals for a period of one to six months in the companys ric and auto loan portfolio the predominant program offering is a deferral of payments to the end of the loan term and waiver of late charges of up to three months for credit cards we offer a temporary payment reduction program for a period of up to three months payment deferrals on mortgages can be for up to one year the company does not consider payment deferrals of up to six months to customers who were current prior to implementation of the companys relief programs to be tdrs in accordance with its accounting policy and interagency regulatory guidelin es additionally the company applies the tdr provisions of the cares act to certain consumer loans that received covid19 modifications if they were current as of december consumer loans that are granted deferrals beyond days are not classified as tdrs if they comply with the requirements of the cares act since the implementation of the programs in march we experienced a sharp increase in requests for relief related to covid19 nationwide and a significant number of such extensions have been granted through september the bank had granted extensions to approximately unique customer accounts totaling approximately billion in connection with covid19 additionally sc has granted over loan extensions to unique customer accounts totaling approximately billion of loans that have been granted a covid19 deferral the following table provides a summary of sbna and sc loan balances with active payment deferrals due to covid19 as of the end of each reporting period item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations september june loan balance of active extensions of portfolio loan balance of active extensions of portfolio santander bank commercial consumer including sbna rics total sbna santander consumer rics santander consumer balances exclude deferrals with payments due in the current month as of september approximately of sbna customer accounts that received extensions were active had exited deferral and had paid down or charged off of the loans that have exited deferral status of the loan balances are less than days past due as of september approximately of scs unique customer accounts have required covid19 assistance of these accounts have exited deferral status remain in active deferral have paidoff and have charged off of the loans that have exited deferral status are less than days past due and of these accounts have made at least one payment since their first covid19 extension the company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time based on this evaluation the company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables chargedoff however the timing of a chargeoff may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a chargeoff to the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is chargedoff historical chargeoff ratios loss confirmation periods and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the alll for loans classified as tdrs are also impacted increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the alll and related credit loss expense changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the alll and related credit loss expense for loans that are classified as tdrs the company generally compares the present value of expected cash flows to the outstanding recorded investment of tdrs to determine the amount of allowance and related credit loss expense that should be recorded for loans that are considered collateraldependent such as certain bankruptcy modifications impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral less its estimated costs to sell credit risk the risk inherent in the companys loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit and collateral quality and is affected by borrowerspecific and economywide facts such as changes in employment gdp hpi cre price index used car prices and other factors

asset and liability management interest rate risk interest rate risk arises primarily through the companys traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits many factors including economic and financial conditions movements in market interest rates and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities interest rate risk is managed by the companys treasury group and measured by its market risk department with oversight by the assetliability committee in managing interest rate risk the company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin to achieve these objectives the treasury group works closely with each business line in the company the treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk including wholesale funding maturity targeting investment portfolio purchase strategies asset securitizationssales and financial derivatives interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates basis risk repricing risk yield curve risk and option risk basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes such as differences in the extent of changes in federal funds rates compared with the threemonth libor repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing such as onemonth versus threemonth reset dates as well as the related maturities yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products these four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations shocks to those simulations and scenario and market value analyses and the subsequent results are reviewed by management numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses including assumptions about new business volumes loan and investment prepayment rates deposit flows interest rate curves economic conditions and competitor pricing item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net interest income simulation analysis the company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense to estimate the companys net interest income sensitivity this simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the companys net interest income sensitivity these scenarios include both parallel and nonparallel rate shocks as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four elements of risk described above this information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the companys risk position remains within shusa board of directorsapproved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates the table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the companys net interest income based on interest rate changes at september and december the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to net interest income would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below september december down basis points up basis points up basis points mve analysis the company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing mve modeling this analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet mve is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities the mve calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size balance sheet mix yield curve relationships or product spreads which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes management examines the effect of interest rate changes on mve the sensitivity of mve to changes in interest rates is a measure of longerterm interest rate risk and highlights

asymmetrical sensitivity between up and down shock is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgagerelated products the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base largely nmds in downward parallel interest rate shocks mortgagerelated products prepayments increase their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited at the same time with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels the company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its nmd customers for upward parallel interest rate shocks extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the companys mortgagerelated products which are predominantly longterm and fixedrate and for larger shocks the loss in market value is not offset by the change in nmds limitations of interest rate risk analyses since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain the company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or mve actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes the difference between actual
