capital resources and asset and liability management the failure of several large us banking institutions in early has led to increased market uncertainty the company was not materially impacted by these events however changing market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the company these factors have increased competition and pricing on customer deposits over the short and medium term and heightened market and regulatory focus and reform on liquidity capital and interest rate risk as a result the fdic published a proposed rule which was finalized on november to charge certain banks a special assessment to recover the costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the bank closures during based on the final rule sbna is required to pay a total of million over the course of eight consecutive quarters beginning in the first quarter of sbna has accrued for the full amount of the special assessment during the fourth quarter of refer to the regulatory matters section of the mda for further details these changing market conditions and uncertainty will likely present challenges in the growth of net interest income and increased credit risk

any other change in the condition of santander could affect shusa regulatory matters the activities of the company and its subsidiaries including sbna and sc are subject to regulation under various us federal laws and regulatory agencies which impose regulations supervise and conduct examinations and may affect the operations and management of the company and its ability to take certain actions including making distributions to our parent santander the company is regulated on a consolidated basis by the federal reserve including the frb of boston and the cfpb the companys subsidiaries are further supervised by the occ the frb of atlanta and the new york department of financial services the federal reserve tailors its supervisory programs and regulatory requirements by category based on firmspecific characteristics such as total assets crossjurisdictional activity and nonbank asset or offbalance sheet exposure as of december shusa was designated a category iv institution under the federal reserves tailoring rule institutions that change to a higher category would become subject to the requirements of the new category as outlined by the federal reserve generally within two quarters of the change in category on july the regulatory agencies issued an npr to modify the definition of crossjurisdictional activity which would expand the scope of exposures included in the measurement of crossjurisdictional activity and has the potential to move certain firms into a higher supervisory category under the federal reserves tailoring rule the company does not expect to be materially impacted by this npr once finalized payment of divid ends shusa is the parent holding company of sbna shusa and sbna are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain wellcapitalized under prompt corrective action regulations refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of this mda for detail of the capital actions of the company and its subsidiaries during the period regulatory capital requirements us basel iii regulatory capital rules are applicable to both shusa and sbna these rules include prompt corrective action thresholds that require banking organizations including the company and sbna to maintain a minimum cet1 capital ratio of a tier capital ratio of a total capital ratio of and a minimum leverage ratio calculated as the ratio of tier capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter of a further capital conservation buffer of above these minimum ratios is required for banking institutions to make capital distributions including paying dividends as described in note to these consolidated financial statements on january we adopted the cecl standard which upon adoption resulted in a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance net of income tax and an increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately billion the us banking agencies in december approved a final rule to address the impact of cecl on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations including the company the option to phase in the dayone impact of cecl until the first quarter of on march the us banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of cecls effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodologys effect on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period shusa remains in the threeyear transition period this interim rule was subsequently updated with technical amendments in a final rule dated september which was elected by the company see the bank regulatory capital section of this mda for the companys capital ratios under basel iii standards the implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the companys regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the company material restrictions can be imposed on sbna including restrictions on interest payable on accounts dismissal of management and in critically undercapitalized situations appointment of a receiver or conservator critically undercapitalized banks generally may not make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt and all but wellcapitalized banks are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval pursuant to the fdia and occ regulations institutions which are not categorized as wellcapitalized or adequatelycapitalized are restricted from making capital distributions which include cash dividends stock redemptions or repurchases cashout mergers interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution at december sbna met the criteria to be classified as wellcapitalized on march the federal reserve adopted a final rule to simplify capital rules for large banks under the final rule firms supervisory stress test results are now used to establish the size of the scb requirement the scb is calculated as the maximum decline in cet1 in the severely adverse scenario subject to a floor plus four quarters of dividends the rule results in new firmspecific regulatory capital expectations which are equal to of cet1 plus the scb any gsib surcharge and any countercyclical capital buffer the gsib buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to shusa in the event a firm falls below its new minimums the rule imposes restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses firms continue to submit a capital plan annually supervisory expectations for capital planning processes do not change under the final rule as of december shusas scb cet1 minimum requirement was on july the federal banking agencies issued a capital proposal that would make significant changes to the regulatory capital rules applicable to large banking organizations including shusa and sbna and banking organizations with significant trading activity this proposal would implement the final elements of the basel iii capital framework and make other changes to the regulatory capital rules in response to recent bank failures the capital proposal would establish the expanded riskbased approach for calculating rwa that would apply to large banking organizations the expanded riskbased approach would include a new more risksensitive standardized approach for measuring credit risk and operational risk it would also include new standardized approaches for measuring market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk but would allow the use of internal models for market risk in certain circumstances with regulatory approval under the capital proposal a large banking organization would be required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the expanded riskbased approach and the current standardized approach and would use the lower of the two all capital buffer requirements including the scb requirement would apply regardless of whether the expanded riskbased approach or the existing standardized approach produces the lower ratio the expanded total rwa calculation used in the expanded riskbased approach would be phased in over a threeyear period starting on july the requirement to reflect aoci in regulatory capital would also be phased in over a threeyear period starting on july all other elements of the calculation of regulatory capital would apply on the effective date of the final rule which is expected to be on or about july on october the federal banking agencies announced that they extended the comment period on the capital proposal from november until january in addition to pushing back the comment deadline the federal reserve indicated it would begin collecting data to gather more information from the banks affected by the proposal that data collection also ended on january the proposed rules and their impact on shusa are under review liquidity rules the federal reserve the fdic and the occ have established a rule to implement the basel iii lcr for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies and a modified version of the lcr for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active the lcr is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30day time horizon smaller covered companies but with more than billion in assets such as the company are required to calculate the lcr monthly resolution planning the dfa requires the company to prepare and update resolution plans the 165d resolution plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the us bankruptcy code and that no extraordinary support is received from the us or any other government the most recent 165d resolution plan was submitted to the federal reserve and fdic in june in addition under amended fdia rules the idi resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors rapid access to their insured deposits maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution on august the fdic issued an npr that modifies the idi resolution planning requirement to focus on operational readiness and changes to existing resolution strategy the proposal tailors the requirements for banks with total assets between billion and billion and those above billion longterm debt requirements on july the federal reserve and fdic issued an npr that would require banks with total assets of billion or more to maintain a layer of longterm debt from the holding company to improve financial stability by increasing the resolvability and resiliency of such institutions by requiring each such large bank to maintain a minimum amount of longterm debt to absorb losses the proposal would increase the options available to resolve such banks in case of failure additionally by reducing the risk that uninsured depositors would face losses longterm debt can reduce the speed and severity of bank runs and limit the risk of contagion when a bank is under stress the proposal would provide a threeyear phasein period and would also allow certain outstanding longterm debt to count toward the minimum requirements to provide banks with a reasonable period to transition to the required characteristics of eligible longterm debt instruments comments on the proposal were due on november shusa remains subject to the tlac requirements outlined below deposit insurance and assessments on october the fdic adopted a final rule applicable to all idis to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by two basis points consistent with the amended restoration plan approved by the fdic on june the fdic indicated that it was taking this action in order to restore the dif reserve ratio to the required statutory minimum of by the statutory deadline of september the fdic indicated that the reserve ratio had declined below this level because of the increase in insured deposits since the start of the pandemic and other factors that affect the level of the dif under the final rule the increase in rates began with the first quarterly assessment period of and will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds in order to support growth in the dif in progressing toward the fdics longterm goal of a reserve ratio the increase in assessment rates applies to sbna the recent failure of several large us banking institutions has led to increased market uncertainty under the fdia the loss to the dif arising from the use of the systemic risk exception must be recovered through one or more special assessments on idis depository institution holding companies or both as the fdic determines to be appropriate on may the fdic issued for public comment a proposed rule to impose a special assessment on idis to recover the loss to the dif resulting from the use of the systemic risk exception to protect the uninsured depositors of the failed us banking institutions the final rule was issued on november under the final rule the fdic would collect a special assessment from idis at a quarterly rate of approximately basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods starting with the first quarterly assessment period of the assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an idis estimated uninsured deposits reported as of december adjusted to exclude the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits held by the idi the special assessment is a taxdeductible operating expense for idis and the effect on income of the entire amount of the special assessment will occur in one quarter for the idis subject to the assessment the impact of the special assessment is million which was recorded in the fourth quarter of upon the rules final issuance the fdic has recently communicated that it will increase the assessment for all banks which will be reported in its june special assessment invoice tlac the tlac rule requires certain us organizations to maintain a minimum amount of lossabsorbing instruments including a minimum amount of unsecured ltd the tlac rule applies to us gsibs and to ihcs with billion or more in us nonbranch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important fbo the company is such an ihc under the tlac rule companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of tlac which consists of a minimum amount of ltd and tier capital as a result shusa must hold the higher

solely of cet1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the tlac buffer it maintains volcker rule section of the bhca commonly referred to as the volcker rule prohibits a banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a covered fund i acquiring or retaining any equity partnership or other ownership interest in the covered fund ii controlling the covered fund or iii engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the covered fund these prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities because the term banking entity includes an idi a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates the volcker rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as santander the company and certain of the companys subsidiaries including sbna and sc as well as other santander subsidiaries in the united states and abroad the company implemented certain policies and procedures training programs recordkeeping internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the volcker rule as required by the volcker rule the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and covered fund activities shusas compliance program includes among other things processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the volcker rule and testing and auditing for compliance risk retention rule the federal reserves final credit risk retention rule generally requires sponsors of abs to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing abs shusa primarily through sc and sbna is an active participant in the structured finance markets and complies with these retention requirements market risk rule the market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold riskbased regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions the bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internal riskbased models the market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the banks internal riskbased models as well as qualitative requirements for the banks management of market risk banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions a bank is subject to the market risk capi tal rules if its consolidated trading activity defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its ffiec and fr y for the previous quarter equals the lesser of percent or more of the banks total assets as reported in its call report and fr y for the previous quarter or billion or m ore the bank and the company are required to comply with the market risk component within rwas of the riskbased capital ratios and submit the ffiec market risk regulatory report shusa is integrating sancaps products models and infrastructure into shusas us market risk rule program which is nearing completion with additional enhancements in until the integration is completed and sancaps models are in compliance with the us market risk rule shusa is required to include and report market risk rwas as of december utilizing the approaches available in the us market risk rule assuming a consistent balance of assets the company expects market risk rwas to decrease as the models are fully implemented heightened standards occ guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions are commonly referred to as heightened standards the heightened standards apply to insured national banks like sbna with billion or more in consolidated assets the heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risktaking activities the heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework transactions with affiliates depository institutions must remain in compliance with sections and of the federal reserve act and the federal reserves regulation w which governs transactions between sbna and affiliated companies and individuals section imposes limits on certain specified covered transactions which include loans lines and letters of credit to affiliated companies or individuals and investments in affiliated companies as well as certain other transactions with affiliated companies and individuals section of the federal reserve act prohibits a depository institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are considered armslength as a us

supervisory agency to assess an institutions record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which it is located sbnas current cra rating is outstanding the occ takes into account sbnas cra rating in considering certain regulatory applications sbna makes including applications related to establishing and relocating branches and the federal reserve does the same with respect to certain regulatory applications the company makes in october the supervisory agencies jointly adopted a cra final rule to modernize the regulation the rule intends to adapt to industry changes such as the growth of online mobile and branchless banking and hybrid models while continuing a focus on low and moderate communities the rule also seeks to introduce greater clarity and consistency by implementing a metricsbased approach to evaluate performance and expanding activity that may be considered for cra credit this results in significant data collection and reporting requirements for banks with over billion in assets such as sbna the rule also imposes new criteria for banks to establish assessment areas outside of the communities in which they have a physical presence if certain criteria are met sbna remains committed to the goals of the cra and supports efforts to modernize the rule through greater transparency regarding evaluation ratings promoting consistent interpretations of cra and encouraging increased economic development in low and moderateincome communities management continues to assess the impact of the rule and will make adjustments

and operational risks to the company as well as to other participants in the market as of december the company has largely completed its libortosofr transition program critical accounting estimates this mda is based on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that have been prepared in accordance with gaap the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates assumptions and judgments and accordingly have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported however the company is not currently aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results management identified accounting for the acl estimates of expected residual values of leased vehicles subject to operating leases and goodwill as the companys most critical accounting estimates in that they are important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain acl the company maintains an alll for the companys hfi portfolio excluding those loans measured at fair value in accordance with applicable accounting standards and a reserve for offbalance sheet commitments representing the expected credit losses for unfunded lending commitments and financial guarantees the reserve for offbalance sheet commitments together with the alll are generally referred to collectively as the acl as described in note and note to the consolidated financial statements the acl is measured using the current expected credit loss model which is based on information derived from historical experience current conditions and prospective information that requires the use of significant judgment by management the model includes both quantitative and qualitative factors with key inputs from unemployment data the hpi gdp growth rates and used vehicle index growth rates along with certain loan level characteristics all used to predict the likelihood of borrower default management applies qualitative factors to capture risks not addressed by the key inputs such as temporary or recent unique market disruptions impacting trends in delinquencies and used vehicle prices while management uses the best information available to make such evaluations future adjustments to the acl may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from these assumptions used in making the evaluations the company generally uses a thirdparty vendors consensus baseline macroeconomic scenario for the quantitative estimate and additional positive and negative macroeconomic scenarios to make qualitative adjustments for macroeconomic uncertainty and considers adjustments to macroeconomic inputs and outputs based on market volatility the baseline scenario was based on the latest consensus forecasts available which showed an improvement in key variables in the current quarter including an expected improvement in unemployment rates which is a key driver to losses and the gdp growth rate offset by expected worsening of the commercial real estate outlook indicating that there may be challenges ahead using the weightedaverage of a range of economic forecast scenarios we estimated at december that the unemployment rate is expected to be approximately at the end of in comparison at december management previously estimated the unemployment rate using the weightedaverage of our economic forecast scenarios to be at the end of additionally the weighted used vehicle index where a higher number corresponds to a higher used car price at auction was estimated at december to be approximately at the end of compared to our estimate at december to be approximately at the end of while the economy saw significant recovery in and into there is still considerable uncertainty regarding overall lifetime loss estimates due to persistent inflation and high interest rates the scenarios used by the company are periodically updated over a reasonable and supportable time horizon with weightings assigned by management and approved through the established governance process under the range of economic forecast scenarios considered based on applying a weighting to the most negative scenario used and without considering the impact of corresponding or offsetting qualitative factors that could have a significant impact on the overall acl the acl would have been higher by approximately billion this range reflects the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses specifically related to the scenarios and weights considered as of december and does not consider other potential adjustments that could increase or decrease loss estimates calculated using alternative economic scenarios management reviews updates and validates its process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis this process involves an analysis of data integrity review of loss and credit trends a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts and other analyses valuation of automotive lease assets and residuals the company has significant investments in vehicles in its operating lease portfolio in accounting for operating leases management must make a determination at the beginning of the lease contract of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term which typically ranges from two to four years at contract inception the company determines the projected residual value based on an internal evaluation of the expected future value this evaluation is based on a proprietary model using internallygenerated data that is compared against thirdparty independent data for reasonableness the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a finance charge however since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract the company is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of leased vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of leased assets to account for residual risk the company depreciates automobile operating lease assets to estimated realizable value on a straightline basis over the lease term the estimated realizable value is initially based on the residual value established at contract inception if the estimated realizable value of a leased vehicle subsequently declines below the residual value at contract inception additional depreciation expense is recorded periodically the company revises the estimated realizable value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and other relevant data points and adjusts depreciation expense appropriately over the remaining term of the lease the company periodically evaluates its investment in operating leases for impairment if circumstances such as a systemic and material decline in used vehicle values occurs these circumstances could include for example a decline in the residual value of our lease portfolio due to an event caused by shocks to oil and gas prices which may have a pronounced impact on certain models of vehicles or pervasive manufacturer defects which may systemically affect the value of a particular brand or model impairment is determined to exist if the fair value of the leased asset is less than its carrying value and it is determined that the net carrying value is not recoverable if a material decline in the used vehicle price were to occur rapidly near the end of the lease term there may not be adequate time for the remaining adjusted depreciation to account for such decline and an impairment charge could be necessary the net carrying value of a leased asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon eventual disposition if our operating lease assets are considered to be impaired the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value as estimated by dcf no such impairment was recognized in or the companys depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers managements expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values the critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automobile lease assets include estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values proper identification and estimation of business conditions our remarketing abilities and automobile manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the value of the lease residuals expected residual values include estimates of payments from automobile manufacturers related to residual support and risksharing agreements if any to the extent an automotive manufacturer is not able to fully honor its obligation relative to these agreements the companys depreciation expense would be negatively impacted if the estimated realizable values of our leased vehicles were to decline below contractual residual values depreciation expense would increase by approximately million over the remaining life of the current lease portfolio goodwill the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities represents goodwill goodwill is not amortized on a recurring basis but rather is subject to periodic impairment testing the company conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on october and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value as more fully described in note to the companys consolidated financial statements a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below as of december the reporting units with assigned goodwill were auto cbb ci cre and cib the evaluation of goodwill impairment requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount including allocated goodwill determining the fair value of reporting units requires significant valuation inputs assumptions and estimates where a reporting unit does not have its own equity assigned for use in calculation of carrying value the company determines the carrying value of each reporting unit using a riskbased capital approach certain of the companys assets are assigned to a corporateother category these assets are related to the companys corporateonly programs such as boli and are not employed in or related to the operations of a reporting unit or considered in determining the fair value of a reporting unit goodwill impairment testing involves managements judgment requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value this is performed using widelyaccepted valuation techniques such as the guideline public company market approach and the income approach the dcf method the company uses a combination of these accepted methodologies to determine the fair valuation of reporting units several factors are taken into account including actual operating results future business plans economic projections and market data the company applied an equal weighting of the income and market approaches for all reporting units the dcf method of the income approach incorporates the reporting units forecasted cash flows including a terminal value to estimate the fair value of cash flows beyond the final year of the forecasts the discount rates utilized to obtain the net present value of the reporting units cash flows were estimated using a capital asset pricing model significant inputs to this model include a riskfree rate of return beta which is a measure of the level of nondiversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit market equity risk premium and in certain cases additional premium for size andor unsystematic companyspecific risk factors the company utilized discount rates that it believes adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets the company estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and riskreturn rates for similar industries of the reporting unit the company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows so actual results may differ from forecasted results when calculating the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach short and mediumterm forecasts incorporated current economic conditions longterm cash flow projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments as well as a longterm rate of return for each reporting unit for all reporting units in the company selected a longterm growth rate of for use in the income approach dcf analysis the market approach includes earnings and pricetotangible book value multiples of comparable public companies which were applied to the earnings and equity for all of the companys reporting units the projected tbv multiple is an indicator of whether the price or perceived value of the companys tangible assets is greater than its book value in the company applied a control premium for the market approach based on the companys review of transactions observable in the marketplace that were determined to be comparable other key assumptions by reporting unit in were as follows table start auto cbb ci cre cib projected tbv discount rate table end no goodwill impairment was recorded in or at the conclusion of the annual assessment it was determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by at least for the auto cbb ci and cib reporting units the estimated fair value of the cre reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately based on its goodwill impairment analysis performed as of october the company concluded that there was no impairment necessary for the cre reporting unit which is comprised of approximately of multifamily loans and multifamily construction loans and of other cre loans the valuation considered multiple financial planning scenarios representing different market recovery profiles the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit has become more sensitive to an impairment as the valuation is highly correlated to loan repricing as a result of the higher interest rate environment and occupancy rates of other cre assets if the reporting units operating environment continues to decline in the foreseeable future there is an increased risk of an impairment all of the preceding fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions in the future examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the reporting units include such items as a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate an economic environment that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates and unexpected regulatory changes refer to the goodwill section of this mda for further details

to a third party with servicing retained resulting in an immaterial loss recorded in noninterest income consumer loans secured by real estate consumer loans secured by real estate decreased million

not secured by real estate rics and auto loans rics and auto loans decreased million from december to december during the fourth quarter of the company completed the sale of a portfolio of approximately million of rics and auto loans with servicing retained there was no material gain or loss on the sale of the loans in addition during the fourth quarter of the company transferred its

refer to further discussion of these in note to the consolidated financial statements as of december of the companys ric and auto loan portfolio balance was comprised of nonprime loans defined by the company as customers with a fico score of below with customers who did not qualify for conventional consumer finance products as a result of among other things a lack of or adverse credit history low income levels andor the inability to provide adequate down payments this also includes of loans for which no fico score was available while underwriting guidelines are designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers additionally higher unemployment rates higher gasoline prices unstable real estate values resets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates the general availability of consumer credit and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies defaults and repossessions as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default because of the historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers the actual rates of delinquencies defaults repossessions and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn the companys automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers the companys robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score using information such as fico scores dti ratios ltv ratios and over other predictive factors placing the applicant in one of pricing tiers the pricing in each tier is continuously monitored and adjusted to reflect market and risk trends in addition to the companys automated process it maintains a team of underwriters for manual review consideration of exceptions and review of deal structures with dealers personal unsecured and other consumer loans personal unsecured and other consumer loans hfi

respectively early stage delinquency consumer loans amounted to billion and billion at december and december respectively management has included these loans in its evaluation of the companys acl and reserved for them during the respective periods the company generally considers an account delinquent when an obligor fails to pay substantially all defined as of the scheduled payment by the due date overall total delinquencies increased by billion from december to december the main driver of this is the increase in past due auto loans in early stages of delinquency due to a return to normal seasonality as well as pressure from inflation loan modifications loan modifications occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower in these cases the company agrees to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans the types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions limitations on accrued interest charged term extensions covenant waivers and deferments of principal modified loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon modification unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification for most portfolios modified loans may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance as long as the company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full ric modifications are placed on nonaccrual status when the company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured and at the latest when the account becomes more than dpd ric modifications are considered for return to accrual when the account becomes days or less past due to the extent the modified loan is determined to be collateraldependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters to the extent the modified loan is determined to be collateraldependent and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral the loan may not be returned to accrual status table start table end the company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time based on this evaluation the company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables chargedoff however the timing of a chargeoff may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a chargeoff to the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is chargedoff historical chargeoff ratios and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the alll for loans classified as modified are also impacted increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the alll and related credit loss expense changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the alll and related credit loss expense effective january the company adopted asu this guidance removes the specific accounting and disclosure guidance for tdr designations and enhances disclosure requirements related to modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty the company adopted the new guidance on january on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings the effect of this implementation was an increase in the acl of approximately million a decrease in retained earnings of approximately million and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of approximately million refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on modified loans credit risk the risk inherent in the companys loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit and collateral quality and is affected by borrowerspecific and economywide factors such as changes in unemployment gdp hpi cre price index used vehicle index and other factors in general there is an inverse relationship between credit quality of transactions and projections of impairment losses so that transactions with better credit quality require a lower expected loss the company manages this risk through its underwriting pricing and credit approval guidelines and servicing policies and practices as well as geographic and other concentration limits the companys acl is principally based on various models subject to the companys model risk management framework new models are approved by the companys model risk management committee models inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually and the company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis required actions resulting from the companys analysis if necessary are governed by its acl committee management uses the qualitative framework to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and that are not considered by the quantitative framework these adjustments are documented and reviewed through the companys risk management processes furthermore management reviews updates and validates its process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis this process involves an analysis of data integrity review of loss and credit trends a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts and other analyses acl levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly required actions resulting from the companys analysis if necessary are governed by its acl committee the acl levels are approved by the boardlevel committees quarterly acl the companys acl was billion at december an increase of million

to sch asset and liability management interest rate risk interest rate risk arises primarily through the companys traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits many factors including economic and financial conditions movements in market interest rates and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities interest rate risk is managed by the companys treasury group and measured by its market risk department with oversight by the assetliability committee in managing interest rate risk the company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin to achieve these objectives the treasury group works closely with each business line in the company the treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk including wholesale funding maturity targeting investment portfolio purchase strategies asset securitizationssales and financial derivatives interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates basis risk repricing risk yield curve risk and option risk basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes such as differences in the extent of changes in federal funds rates compared with the threemonth term sofr repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing such as onemonth versus threemonth reset dates as well as the related maturities yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products these four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations shocks to those simulations and scenario and market value analyses and the subsequent results are reviewed by management several assumptions and models are used to produce these analyses including assumptions about new business volumes loan and investment prepayment rates deposit flows interest rate curves economic conditions and competitor pricing certain models use historical data analyses to estimate future customer behavior such as deposit repricing and attrition estimates from these models can differ from actual behavior depending on various factors such as macroeconomic conditions competitor response etc net interest income simulation analysis the company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense to estimate the companys net interest income sensitivity this simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the companys net interest income sensitivity these various scenarios include parallel nonparallel gradual parallel and gradual nonparallel rate shocks applied relative to the implied marketbased forward curve as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four measures of risk described above the shocks below are extended using the parallel scenario and are applied instantaneously to the implied forward curve as of the stated monthend the basis point down shock has been added as market rates have increased this set of shocks represents a range of plausible rate shocks as an instantaneous shock basis points down can be analogous to a gradual rampdown of basis points over one year this information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the companys risk position remains within shusa board of directorsapproved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates the table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the companys net interest income based on interest rate changes at december and december table start the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to net interest income would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below december december down basis points down basis points up basis points up basis points table end mve analysis the company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing mve modeling this analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet mve is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities the mve calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size balance sheet mix yield curve relationships or product spreads which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes management examines the effect of interest rate changes on mve the sensitivity of mve to changes in interest rates is a measure of longerterm interest rate risk and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates the following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the companys mve at december and december table start the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to mve would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below december december down basis points down basis points up basis points up basis points table end as of december the companys profile reflected an increase of mve of for downward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points and a decrease of for upward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points the asymmetrical sensitivity between a basis point increase and a basis point decrease is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgagerelated products the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base largely nmds in downward parallel interest rate shocks mortgagerelated products prepayments increase their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited at the same time with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels the company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its nmd customers for upward parallel interest rate shocks extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the companys mortgagerelated products which are predominantly longterm and fixedrate and for larger shocks the loss in market value is not offset by the change in nmds limitations of interest rate risk analyses since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain the company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or mve actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume characteristics of new business behavior of existing positions and changes in market conditions and management strategies among other factors uses of derivatives to manage interest rate and other risks to mitigate interest rate risk and to a lesser extent foreign exchange equity and credit risks the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income the fair value of assets and liabilities and cash flows the company is subject to price risk through its capital markets and mortgage banking activities the company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios in addition shusas board of directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities the level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements and will vary from period to period management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows these instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments the nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments the companys derivatives portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps the company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold the majority of the companys residential msrs are accounted for at fair value as deemed appropriate the company economically hedges msrs using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase mbs for additional information on msrs see note to the consolidated financial statements the company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities foreign exchange contracts which include spot and forward contracts represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreedupon price on an agreedupon settlement date exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate the company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales for additional information on foreign exchange contracts derivatives and hedging activities see note to the consolidated financial statements nongaap financial measures the companys nongaap information has limitations as an analytical tool and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under gaap as set forth in the companys financial statements these limitations should be compensated for by relying primarily on the companys gaap results and using this nongaap information only as a supplement to evaluate the companys performance the company considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy these calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes because gaap does not include capital ratio measures the company believes that there are no comparable gaap financial measures to these ratios these ratios are not formally defined by gaap and are considered to be nongaap financial measures since analysts and banking regulators may assess the companys capital adequacy using these ratios the company believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis the company believes these nongaap measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these measures may allow readers to compare certain aspects of the companys capitalization to other organizations however because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios the companys calculations may not be directly comparable with those of other organizations and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited as a result the company encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial
