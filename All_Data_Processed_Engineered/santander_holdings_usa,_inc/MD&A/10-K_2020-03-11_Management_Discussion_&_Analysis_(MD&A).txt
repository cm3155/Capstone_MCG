the tailoring rule the new tailored standards are discussed further below regulatory capital requirements us basel iii regulatory capital rules are applicable to both shusa and the bank and establish a comprehensive capital framework that includes both the advanced approaches for the largest internationally active us banks formerly known as basel ii and a standardized approach that applies to all banking organizations with over million in assets these rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum riskbased capital ratios and prompt corrective action thresholds that when fully phased in require banking organizations including the company and the bank to maintain a minimum cet1 capital ratio of a tier capital ratio of a total capital ratio of and a minimum leverage ratio calculated as the ratio of tier capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter of a further capital conservation buffer of above these minimum ratios was phased in effective january this buffer is required for banking institutions and bhcs to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions including paying dividends these us basel iii regulatory capital rules include deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that msrs deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities are deducted from cet1 to the extent any one such category exceeds of cet1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed of cet1 implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet1 for the company and the bank began on january and was initially planned over three years with a fully phasedin requirement of january however during the regulatory agencies finalized changes to the capital rules that became effective on january these changes extended the current treatment and deferred the final transition provision phasein at nonadvanced approach institutions for certain capital elements and suspended the riskweight to percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital in lieu of advancing to percent during the regulatory agencies approved a final rule which includes simplifications for nonadvanced approaches to the generally applicable capital rules specifically with regard to the treatment of minority interest as well as modifying the riskweight to percent for certain deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital this final rule will become effective on april see the bank regulatory capital section of this mda for the companys capital ratios under basel iii standards the implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the companys regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the company item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations if capital has reached the significantly or critically undercapitalized levels further material restrictions can be imposed including restrictions on interest payable on accounts dismissal of management and in critically undercapitalized situations appointment of a receiver or conservator critically undercapitalized institutions generally may not beginning days after becoming critically undercapitalized make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt all but wellcapitalized institutions are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvements act and occ regulations institutions which are not categorized as wellcapitalized or adequatelycapitalized are restricted from making capital distributions which include cash dividends stock redemptions or repurchases cashout mergers interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution at december the bank met the criteria to be classified as wellcapitalized on april the federal reserve issued a npr seeking comment on a proposal to simplify capital rules for large banks if finalized as proposed the npr would replace the capital conservation buffer the capital conservation buffer would be replaced with a new scb the scb is calculated as the maximum decline in cet1 in the severely adverse scenario subject to a floor plus four quarters of dividends the proposal would result in new regulatory capital minimums which are equal to cet1 plus the scb any gsib surcharge and any countercyclical capital buffer the gsib buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to shusa these new minimums would be firmspecific and would trigger restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses in the event a firm falls below their new minimums firms would still submit a capital plan annually supervisory expectations for capital planning processes would not change under the proposal the company does not expect this npr if finalized as proposed to have a material impact on its current or future planned capital actions this rule was finalized on march and its impact is being evaluated stress testing and capital planning the dfa also requires certain banks and bhcs including the company to perform a stress test and submit a capital plan to the federal reserve and receive a notice of nonobjection before taking capital actions such as paying dividends implementing common equity repurchase programs or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments in june the company announced that the federal reserve did not object to the planned capital actions described in the companys capital plan through june in february the federal reserve announced that shusa as well as other less complex firms would receive a oneyear extension of the requirement to submit its capital plan until april the federal reserve also announced that for the period beginning july through june the company would be allowed to make capital distributions up to the amount that would have allowed it to remain above all minimum capital requirements in ccar adjusted for any changes in the companys regulatory capital ratios since the federal reserve acted on the capital plan in october the federal reserve finalized rules that tailor the stress testing and capital actions a company is required to perform based on the companys asset size crossjurisdictional activity reliance on shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets and offbalance sheet exposure under the tailoring rules the company is required to submit a capital plan to the federal reserve on an annual basis the company is also subject to supervisory stress testing on a twoyear cycle the company continues to evaluate planned capital actions in its annual capital plan and on an ongoing basis liquidity rules the federal reserve the fdic and the occ have established a rule to implement the basel iii lcr for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies and a modified version of the lcr for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active the lcr is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30day time horizon smaller covered companies more than billion in assets such as the company were required to calculate the lcr monthly beginning january in october the federal reserve finalized rules that tailor the liquidity requirements based on a companys asset size crossjurisdictional activity reliance on shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets and offbalance sheet exposure in light of the fact that the company is under billion in assets and has less than billion in shortterm wholesale funding the company is no longer required to disclose the us lcr item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the nsfr is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a oneyear time horizon the nsfr requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on and offbalance sheet activities thereby reducing the likelihood that disruptions to a banks regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity in a way that could increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress in may the federal reserve issued a proposed rule for nsfr applicable to us financial institutions the proposed rule has not been finalized and the company is currently evaluating the impact the proposed rule would have on its financial position results of operations and disclosures resolution planning the dfa requires all bhcs and fbos with assets of billion or more to prepare and regularly update resolution plans the 165d resolution plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the us bankruptcy code and that no extraordinary support is received from the us or any other government the most recent 165d resolution plan was submitted to the federal reserve and fdic in december in addition under amended federal deposit insurance corporation improvements act rules the idi resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors rapid access to their insured deposits maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution the most recent idi resolution plan was submitted to the fdic in june shusa and sbna are currently awaiting feedback tlac the tlac rule requires certain us organizations to maintain a minimum amount of lossabsorbing instruments including a minimum amount of unsecured ltd the tlac rule applies to us gsibs and to ihcs with billion or more in us nonbranch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important fbo the company is such an ihc under the tlac rule companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of tlac which consists of a minimum amount of ltd and tier capital as a result shusa must hold the higher of of its rwas or of its total consolidated assets in the form of tlac of which of its rwas or of total consolidated assets must consist of ltd in addition shusa must maintain a tlac buffer composed solely of cet1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the tlac buffer it maintains the tlac rule became effective on january volcker rule the dfa added new section to the bank holding company act which is commonly referred to as the volcker rule the volcker rule prohibits a banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a covered fund i acquiring or retaining any equity partnership or other ownership interest in the covered fund ii controlling the covered fund or iii engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the covered fund these prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities because the term banking entity includes an idi a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates the volcker rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as santander the company and certain of the companys subsidiaries including the bank and sc as well as other santander subsidiaries in the united states and abroad the company implemented certain policies and procedures training programs recordkeeping internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the volcker rule as required by the volcker rule the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and covered fund activities shusas compliance program includes among other things processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the volcker rule testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule in october the joint agencies responsible for administering the volcker rule finalized revisions to volcker rule the final rule tailors the volcker rules compliance requirements to the amount of a firms trading activity revise the definition of a trading account clarify certain key provisions in the volcker rule and simplify the information companies are required to provide the banking agencies the company is still evaluating the impact of this final rule item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk retention rule in december the federal reserve issued its final credit risk retention rule which generally requires sponsors of abs to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing abs shusa primarily through sc is an active participant in the structured finance markets and began to comply with the retention requirements effective in december market risk rule the market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold riskbased regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions the bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internalrisk based models the market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the banks internal risk based models as well as qualitative requirements for the banks management of market risk banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions a bank is subject to the market risk capital rules if its consolidated trading activity defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its ffiec and fr y for the previous quarter equals the lesser of percent or more of the banks total assets as reported in its call report and fr y for the previous quarter or billion or more at september sbna reported aggregate trading exposure in excess of the market risk threshold and as a result both the company and sbna began holding the market risk component within rwa of the riskbased capital ratios and submitted the ffiec market risk regulatory report beginning for the period ended december the incorporation of market risk within regulatory capital has resulted in a decrease in the riskbased capital ratios capital simplification rule the federal banking agencies are adopting a final rule that simplifies for nonadvanced approaches banking organizations the generally applicable capital rules and makes a number of technical corrections specifically it reverses the previous transition provision freeze on msrs and deferred tax assets by modifying the riskweight from to the rule will also replace the existing methodology for calculating includible minority interest with a flat limit at each capital level the increased risk weighting presents an unfavorable decline to the companys riskbased ratios but it is estimated that the tier and total capital ratios will improve overall due to the additional minority interest includible under the simplified rule the capital simplification rule becomes effective april however regulators have granted the option for institutions to adopt early on january the company plans to adopt this new rule on april heightened standards occ guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions are commonly referred to as heightened standards the heightened standards apply to insured national banks with billion or more in consolidated assets the heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risktaking activities the heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework transactions with affiliates depository institutions must remain in compliance with sections and of the federal reserve act and the federal reserves

and accompanying notes that have been prepared in accordance with gaap the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates assumptions and judgments and accordingly have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported however the company is not currently aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results management identified accounting for alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments estimates of expected residual values of leased vehicles subject to operating leases accretion of discounts and subvention on rics goodwill fair value measurements and income taxes as the companys most critical accounting estimates in that they are important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain alll for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments represent managements best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio the adequacy of shusas alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments is regularly evaluated this evaluation process is subject to several estimates and applications of judgment managements evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb loan and lease losses takes into consideration the risks in the loan portfolio past loan and lease loss experience specific loans that have loss potential geographic and industry concentrations delinquency trends economic conditions the level of originations and other relevant factors management also considers loan quality changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio the amount of npls and industry trends changes in these estimates could have a direct material impact on the provision for credit losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations andor could result in a change in the recorded allowance and reserve for unfunded lending commitments the loan portfolio represents the largest asset on the consolidated balance sheets note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments in the consolidated balance sheets a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the alll and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the periods presented is included in the credit risk management section of this mda the alll includes i an allocated allowance which is comprised of allowances established on loans specifically evaluated for impairment and loans collectively evaluated for impairment based on historical loan and lease loss experience adjusted for current trends general economic conditions and other risk factors and ii an unallocated allowance to account for a level of imprecision in managements estimation process generally the companys loans held for investment are carried at amortized cost net of the alll the alll includes the estimate of credit losses to be realized during the loss emergence period based on the recorded investment in the loan including net discounts that are expected at the time of chargeoff in the case of loans purchased in a bulk purchase or business combination the entire discount on the loan portfolio is considered as available to absorb the credit losses when determining the alll for these loans the company records provisions for credit losses when incurred losses exceed the unaccreted purchase discount reserve levels are collectively reviewed for adequacy and approved quarterly the companys allocated reserves are principally based on various models subject to the companys model risk management framework new models are approved by the companys model risk management committee models inputs and documentation are further reviewed and validated at least annually and the company completes a detailed variance analysis of historical model projections against actual observed results on a quarterly basis required actions resulting from the companys analysis if necessary are governed by its allowance for loan and lease losses committee the companys unallocated allowance is no more than of the overall allowance this is considered to be reasonably sufficient to absorb imprecisions of models to otherwise provide for coverage of inherent losses in the companys entire loan and lease portfolio imprecisions include loss factors in the loan portfolio that may not have been discreetly contemplated in the general and specific components of the allowance as well as potential variability in estimates periodtoperiod changes in the companys historical unallocated alll positions are considered in light of these factors item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations valuation of automotive lease assets and residuals the company has significant investments in vehicles in scs operating lease portfolio in accounting for operating leases management must make a determination at the beginning of the lease contract of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term which typically ranges from two to four years at contract inception the company determines the projected residual value based on an internal evaluation of the expected future value this evaluation is based on a proprietary model using internallygenerated data that is compared against thirdparty independent data for reasonableness the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a finance charge however since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract the company is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of leased vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of leased assets to account for residual risk the company depreciates automobile operating lease assets to estimated realizable value on a straightline basis over the lease term the estimated realizable value is initially based on the residual value established at contract inception periodically the company revises the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and other relevant data points and adjusts depreciation expense appropriately over the remaining term of the lease the company periodically evaluates its investment in operating leases for impairment if circumstances such as a systemic and material decline in used vehicle values occurs these circumstances could include for example a decline in the residual value of our lease portfolio due to an event caused by shocks to oil and gas prices which may have a pronounced impact on certain models of vehicles or pervasive manufacturer defects which may systemically affect the value of a particular brand or model impairment is determined to exist if the fair value of the leased asset is less than its carrying value and it is determined that the net carrying value is not recoverable the net carrying value of a leased asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon eventual disposition if our operating lease assets are considered to be impaired the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value as estimated by dcf no such impairment was recognized in or the companys depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers managements expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values the critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automobile lease assets include estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values proper identification and estimation of business conditions our remarketing abilities and automobile manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the value of the lease residuals expected residual values include estimates of payments from automobile manufacturers related to residual support and risksharing agreements if any to the extent an automotive manufacturer is not able to fully honor its obligation relative to these agreements the companys depreciation expense would be negatively impacted accretion of discounts and subvention on rics lhfi include the ric portfolio which consists largely of nonprime automobile loans and which are primarily acquired individually from dealers at a nonrefundable discount from the contractual principal amount the company also pays dealer participation on certain receivables the amortization of discounts subvention payments from manufacturers and other origination costs are recognized as adjustments to the yield of the related contracts the company applies significant assumptions including prepayment speeds in estimating the accretion rates used to approximate effective yield the company estimates future principal prepayments specific to pools of homogeneous loans which are based on the vintage credit quality at origination and term of the loan prepayments in our portfolio are sensitive to credit quality with higher credit quality loans experiencing higher voluntary prepayment rates than lower credit quality loans the impact of defaults is not considered in the prepayment rate the prepayment rate only considers voluntary prepayments the resulting prepayment rate specific to each pool is based on historical experience and is used as an input in the calculation of the constant effective yield item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations goodwill the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities represents goodwill goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized on a recurring basis but rather are subject to periodic impairment testing as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below the company conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on october and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value as of december the reporting units with assigned goodwill were consumer and business banking ci cre vf cib and sc an entitys quantitative goodwill impairment analysis must be completed unless the entity determines based on certain qualitative factors that it is more likely than not that is a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount including goodwill and that no impairment exists an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the preceding qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test the quantitative analysis requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount including its allocated goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than the fair value impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value a recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit and cannot subsequently be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers the company utilizes the market capitalization approach to determine the fair value of its sc reporting unit as it is a publicly traded company that has a single reporting unit determining the fair value of the remaining reporting units requires significant valuation inputs assumptions and estimates the company determines the carrying value of each reporting unit using a riskbased capital approach certain of the companys assets are assigned to a corporateother category these assets are related to the companys corporateonly programs such as boli and are not employed in or related to the operations of a reporting unit or considered in determining the fair value of a reporting unit goodwill impairment testing involves managements judgment requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value this is performed using widelyaccepted valuation techniques such as the guideline public company market approach earnings and pricetotangible book value multiples of comparable public companies the market capitalization approach share price of the reporting unit and control premium of comparable public companies and the income approach the dcf method the company uses a combination of these accepted methodologies to determine the fair valuation of reporting units several factors are taken into account including actual operating results future business plans economic projections and market data the guideline public company market approach market approach includes earnings and pricetotangible book value multiples of comparable public companies which were applied to the earnings and equity for all of the companys reporting units the market capitalization plus control premium approach was applied to the companys sc reporting unit as the sc reporting unit is a publicly traded subsidiary whose securities are traded in an active market in connection with the market capitalization plus control premium approach applied to the companys sc reporting unit the company used scs stock price as of the date of the annual impairment analysis the company also considered historical auto loan industry transactions and control premiums over the last three years in determining the control premium item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the dcf method of the income approach incorporates the reporting units forecasted cash flows including a terminal value to estimate the fair value of cash flows beyond the final year of the forecasts the discount rates utilized to obtain the net present value of the reporting units cash flows were estimated using a capital asset pricing model significant inputs to this model include a riskfree rate of return beta which is a measure of the level of nondiversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit market equity risk premium and in certain cases additional premium for size andor unsystematic companyspecific risk factors the company utilized discount rates that it believes adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets the company estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and riskreturn rates for similar industries of the reporting unit the company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows so actual results may differ from forecasted results all of the preceding fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions in the future examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impacts the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units include such items as table start a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate table endtable start an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree table endtable start volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates and unexpected regulatory changes table endtable start specific to the sc reporting unit a decrease in scs share price would impact the fair value of the reporting segment table end refer to the financial condition goodwill section of this mda for further details on the companys goodwill including the results of managements goodwill impairment analyses fair value measurements the company uses fair value measurements to estimate the fair value of certain assets and liabilities for both measurement and disclosure purposes refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized the company follows the fair value hierarchy set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value the company reviews and modifies as necessary the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis accordingly there may be reclassifications between hierarchy levels due to changes in inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value the company has numerous internal controls in place to ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurements certain valuations are benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available considerable judgment is used in forming conclusions from observable market data used to estimate the companys level fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to the companys internal valuation models used to estimate level fair value measurements level inputs such as interest rate movements prepayment speeds credit losses recovery rates and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements accordingly the companys estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current market exchange item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which includes considerable judgment deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases including investments in subsidiaries deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that apply or will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse or be realized the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance will be established if the company determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized this requires periodic analysis of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and when the deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of deferred tax assets the critical assumptions used in the companys deferred tax asset valuation allowance analysis are as follows a the expectation of future earnings b estimates of the companys longterm annual growth rate based on the companys longterm economic outlook in the us c estimates of the dividend income payout ratio from the companys consolidated subsidiary sc based on current policies and practices of sc d estimates of book income to tax income differences based on the analysis of historical differences and the historical timing of the reversal of temporary differences e the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid f estimates of tax credits to be earned on current investments based on the companys evaluation of the credits applicable to each investment g experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused h estimates of applicable state tax rates based on currentmost recent enacted tax rates and state apportionment calculations i tax planning strategies and j current tax laws significant judgment is required to assess future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences the company makes certain assertions in regards to its investment in subsidiaries which impact whether a deferred tax liability is recorded for the book over tax basis difference in the investment in these subsidiaries this requires the company to make judgments with respect to its ability to permanently reinvest its earnings in foreign subsidiaries and its ability to recover its investment in domestic subsidiaries in a tax free manner the company bases its expectations of future earnings which are used to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets on financial performance forecasts of its operating subsidiaries and unconsolidated investees the budgets and estimates used in these forecasts are approved by the companys management and the assumptions underlying the forecasts are reviewed at least annually and adjusted as necessary based on current developments or when new information becomes available the updates made and the variances between the companys forecasts and its actual performance have not been significant enough to alter the companys conclusions with regard to the realizability of its deferred tax asset the company continues to forecast sufficient taxable income to fully realize its current deferred tax assets forecasted taxable income is subject to changes in overall market and global economic conditions in establishing a provision for income tax expense the company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws in the us its states and municipalities and abroad actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending on changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed the company reviews its tax balances quarterly and as new information becomes available interest and penalties on income tax payments are included within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations the company recognizes tax benefits in its financial statements when it is more likely than not the related tax position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority

liability management interest rate risk interest rate risk arises primarily through the companys traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits many factors including economic and financial conditions movements in market interest rates and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities interest rate risk is managed by the companys treasury group and measured by its market risk department with oversight by the assetliability committee in managing interest rate risk the company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin to achieve these objectives the treasury group works closely with each business line in the company the treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk including wholesale funding maturity targeting investment portfolio purchase strategies asset securitizationssales and financial derivatives interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates basis risk repricing risk yield curve risk and option risk basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes such as differences in the extent of changes in federal funds rates compared with the threemonth libor repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing such as onemonth versus threemonth reset dates as well as the related maturities yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products these four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations shocks to those simulations and scenario and market value analyses and the subsequent results are reviewed by management numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses including assumptions about new business volumes loan and investment prepayment rates deposit flows interest rate curves economic conditions and competitor pricing net interest income simulation analysis the company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense to estimate the companys net interest income sensitivity this simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the companys net interest income sensitivity these scenarios include both parallel and nonparallel rate shocks as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four elements of risk described above this information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the companys risk position remains within shusa board of directorsapproved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates the table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the companys net interest income based on interest rate changes at december and december table start the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to net interest income would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below december december down basis points up basis points up basis points table end mve analysis the company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing mve modeling this analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet mve is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities the mve calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size balance sheet mix yield curve relationships or product spreads which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management examines the effect of interest rate changes on mve the sensitivity of mve to changes in interest rates is a measure of longerterm interest rate risk and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates the following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the companys mve at december and december table start the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to mve would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below december december down basis points up basis points up basis points table end as of december the companys profile reflected a decrease of mve of for downward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points and an increase of for upward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points the asymmetrical sensitivity between up and down shock is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgagerelated products the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base largely nmds in downward parallel interest rate shocks mortgagerelated products prepayments increase their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited at the same time with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels the company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its nmd customers for upward parallel interest rate shocks extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the companys mortgagerelated products which are predominantly longterm and fixedrate and for larger shocks the loss in market value is not offset by the change in nmd limitations of interest rate risk analyses since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain the company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or mve actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume characteristics of new business behavior of existing positions and changes in market conditions and management strategies among other factors uses of derivatives to manage interest rate and other risks to mitigate interest rate risk and to a lesser extent foreign exchange equity and credit risks the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income the fair value of assets and liabilities and cash flows through the companys capital markets and mortgage banking activities it is subject to price risk the company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios in addition shusas board of directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities the level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements and will vary from period to period management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows these instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments the nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments the companys derivatives portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps as part of its overall business strategy the bank originates residential mortgages it sells a portion of this production to the fhlmc the fnma and private investors the company uses forward sales as a means of hedging against the economic impact of changes in interest rates on the mortgages that are originated for sale and on interest rate lock commitments the company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold the majority of the companys residential msrs are accounted for at fair value as deemed appropriate the company economically hedges msrs using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase mbs for additional information on msrs see note to the consolidated financial statements item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities foreign exchange contracts which include spot and forward contracts represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreedupon price on an agreedupon settlement date exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate the company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales and equity options which manage its market risk associated with certain customer deposit products for additional information on foreign exchange contracts derivatives and hedging activities see note to the consolidated financial statements borrowings and other debt obligations the company has term loans and lines of credit with santander and other lenders the bank utilizes borrowings and other debt obligations as a source of funds for its asset growth and assetliability management the bank also utilizes repurchase agreements which are shortterm obligations collateralized by securities in addition sc has warehouse lines of credit and securitizes some of its rics and operating leases which are structured secured financings total borrowings and

information has limitations as an analytical tool and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under gaap as set forth in the companys financial statements these limitations should be compensated for by relying primarily on the companys gaap results and using this nongaap information only as a supplement to evaluate the companys performance the company considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy these calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes because gaap does not include capital ratio measures the company believes that there are no comparable gaap financial measures to these ratios these ratios are not formally defined by gaap and are considered to be nongaap financial measures since analysts and banking regulators may assess the companys capital adequacy using these ratios the company believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis the company believes these nongaap measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these measures may allow readers to compare certain aspects of the companys capitalization to other organizations however because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios the companys calculations may not be directly comparable with those of other organizations and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited as a result the company encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial
