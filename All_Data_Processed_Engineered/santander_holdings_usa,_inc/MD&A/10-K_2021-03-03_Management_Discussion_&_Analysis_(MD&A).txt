reporting units utilizing assumptions consistent with our october impairment test and noted no impairment management continues to monitor changes in financial position and results of operations that would impact each of the reporting units estimated fair value or carrying value on a regular basis through the date of this filing there have been no indicators which would change managements assessment as of october deferred taxes and other tax activity the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of million at december consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of million and a deferred tax liability balance of million compared to a net deferred tax liability balance of billion at december consisting of a deferred tax asset balance of million and a deferred tax liability balance of billion during the third quarter the companys ownership of sc reached the threshold which requires sc to file a consolidated federal tax return with the company as a result shusa reversed its deferred tax liability of million for the book over tax basis difference in its investment in sc the million decrease in net deferred liability for the year ended december was primarily due to the adoption of the cecl standard during the first quarter of and the reversal of the deferred tax liability for the book over tax basis difference associated with the companys investment in sc during the third quarter of bank regulatory capital the companys capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment while maintaining appropriate capital in light of economic uncertainty and the basel iii framework the company is subject to the regulations of certain federal state and foreign agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities at december and december based on the banks capital calculations the bank was considered wellcapitalized under the applicable capital framework in addition the companys capital levels as of december and december based on the companys capita l calculations exceeded the required capital ratios for bhcs for a discussion of basel iii including the standardized approach and related future changes to the minimum us regulatory capital ratios see the section captioned regulatory matters in this mda federal banking laws regulations and policies also limit the banks ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to the company the bank must obtain prior occ approval to declare a dividend or make any other capital distribution if after such dividend or distribution the banks total distributions to shusa within that calendar year would exceed of its net income during the year plus retained net income for the prior two years the bank would not meet capital levels imposed by the occ in connection with any order or the bank is not adequately capitalized at the time the occs prior approval would also be required if the bank were notified by the occ that it is a problem institution or in troubled condition any dividend declared and paid or return of capital has the effect of reducing capital ratios during the years ended december and the company paid cash dividends of million

position of the company include loan origination volumes loan prepayment rates the maturity structure of existing loans core deposit growth levels cd maturity structure and retention the companys credit ratings investment portfolio cash flows the maturity structure of the companys wholesale funding and other factors these risks are monitored and managed centrally the companys assetliability committee reviews and approves the companys liquidity policy and guidelines on a regular basis this process includes reviewing all available wholesale liquidity sources the company also forecasts future liquidity needs and develops strategies to ensure adequate liquidity is available at all times shusa conducts monthly liquidity stress test analyses to manage its liquidity under a variety of scenarios all of which demonstrate that the company has ample liquidity to meet its shortterm and longterm cash requirements further changes to the credit ratings of shusa santander and its affiliates or the kingdom of spain could have a material adverse effect on shusas business including its liquidity and capital resources the credit ratings of shusa have changed in the past and may change in the future which could impact its cost of and access to sources of financing and liquidity any reductions in the longterm or shortterm credit ratings of shusa would increase its borrowing costs and require it to replace funding lost due to the downgrade which may include the loss of customer deposits limit its access to capital and money markets and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivatives contracts and other secured funding arrangements see further discussion on the impacts of credit ratings actions in the economic and business environment section of this mda sources of liquidity company and bank the company and the bank have several sources of funding to meet liquidity requirements including the banks core deposit base liquid investment securities portfolio ability

details on the companys sources and uses of cash credit facilities thirdparty revolving credit facilities warehouse lines sc uses warehouse facilities to fund its originations each facility specifies the required collateral characteristics collateral concentrations credit enhancement and advance rates scs warehouse facilities generally are backed by auto rics or auto leases these facilities generally have one or twoyear commitments staggered maturities and floating interest rates sc maintains daily and longterm funding forecasts for originations acquisitions and other large outflows such as tax payments to balance the desire to minimize funding costs with its liquidity needs scs warehouse facilities generally have net spread delinquency and net loss ratio limits generally these limits are calculated based on the portfolio collateralizing the respective line however for certain of scs warehouse facilities delinquency and net loss ratios are calculated with respect to its serviced portfolio as a whole failure to meet any of these covenants could trigger increased overcollateralization requirements or in the case of limits calculated with respect to the specific portfolio underlying certain credit lines result in an event of default under these agreements if an event of default occurred under one of these agreements the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the impacted agreement to be immediately due and payable enforce their interests against collateral pledged under the agreement restrict scs ability to obtain additional borrowings under the agreement andor remove sc as servicer sc has never had a warehouse facility terminated due to failure to comply with any ratio or a failure to meet any covenant a default under one of these

securitizations under rule of the securities act and privately issues amortizing notes sc has onbalance sheet securitizations outstanding in the market with a cumulative abs balance of approximately billion deficiency and debt forward flow agreement in addition to scs credit facilities and secured structured financings sc has a flow agreement in place with a third party for chargedoff assets loans and leases sold under these flow agreements are not on scs balance sheet but provide a stable stream of servicing fee income and may also provide a gain or loss on sale offbalance sheet financing beginning in sc had the option to sell a contractually determined amount of eligible prime loans to santander through securitization platforms as all of the notes and residual interests in the securitizations are acquired by santander sc recorded these transactions as true sales of the rics securitized and removed the sold assets from its consolidated balance sheets beginning in this program was replaced with a new program with sbna whereby sc has agreed to provide sbna with origination support services in connection with the processing underwriting and purchasing of retail loans primarily from fca dealers all of which are serviced by sc sc also continues to periodically execute securitizations under rule of the securities act after retaining the required credit risk retention via a vertical interest sc transfers all remaining notes and residual interests in these securitizations to third parties sc subsequently records these transactions as true sales of the rics securitized and removes the sold assets from its consolidated balance sheets uses of liquidity the company uses liquidity for debt service and repayment of borrowings as well as for funding loan commitments and satisfying deposit withdrawal requests sis uses liquidity primarily to support underwriting transactions the primary use of liquidity for bsi is to meet customer liquidity requirements

to all ccar banks to the average trailing net income based on the companys expected average trailing four quarters of net income sc is prohibited from paying a dividend in the fourth quarter of although scs standalone income is sufficient to declare and pay a dividend sc is consolidated into the companys capital plan and therefore is subject to the federal reserve boards interim policy that utilizes the companys average trailing income to determine the cap on common stock dividends sc did not declare or pay a dividend in the fourth quarter of sc has paid a total of million in dividends through december of which million has been paid to nci and million has been paid to the company which eliminates in the consolidated results of the company during the three months ended march sc

section of this mda for a discussion of the status of litigation with which the company is involved with the irs please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations and other commitments the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business as a source of funds for its asset growth and assetliability management and to meet required capital needs these obligations require the company to make cash payments over time as detailed in the table below table start payments due by period in thousands total less than year over year to

nonqualified pension and postretirement benefits operating leases total contractual cash obligations other commitments commitments to extend credit letters of credit total contractual obligations and other commitments table end includes interest on both fixed and variable rate obligations the interest associated with variable rate obligations is based on interest rates in effect at december the contractual amounts to be paid on variable rate obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates future changes in market interest rates could materially affect the contractual amounts to be paid includes all carrying value adjustments such as unamortized premiums and discounts and hedge basis adjustments does not include future expected sublease income or interest of million excluded from the above table are deposits of billion that are due on demand by customers the company is a party to financial instruments and other arrangements with offbalance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates see further discussion on these risks in note and note to the consolidated financial statements asset and liability management interest rate risk interest rate risk arises primarily through the companys traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits many factors including economic and financial conditions movements in market interest rates and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities interest rate risk is managed by the companys treasury group and measured by its market risk department with oversight by the assetliability committee in managing interest rate risk the company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin to achieve these objectives the treasury group works closely with each business line in the company the treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk including wholesale funding maturity targeting investment portfolio purchase strategies asset securitizationssales and financial derivatives interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates basis risk repricing risk yield curve risk and option risk basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes such as differences in the extent of changes in federal funds rates compared with the threemonth libor repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing such as onemonth versus threemonth reset dates as well as the related maturities yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products these four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations shocks to those simulations and scenario and market value analyses and the subsequent results are reviewed by management numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses including assumptions about new business volumes loan and investment prepayment rates deposit flows interest rate curves economic conditions and competitor pricing net interest income simulation analysis the company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense to estimate the companys net interest income sensitivity this simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the companys net interest income sensitivity these scenarios include both parallel and nonparallel rate shocks as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four elements of risk described above this information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the companys risk position remains within shusa board of directorsapproved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates the table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the companys net interest income based on interest rate changes at december and december table start the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to net interest income would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below december december down basis points up basis points up basis points table end mve analysis the company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing mve modeling this analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet mve is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities the mve calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size balance sheet mix yield curve relationships or product spreads which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes management examines the effect of interest rate changes on mve the sensitivity of mve to changes in interest rates is a measure of longerterm interest rate risk and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates the following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the companys mve at december and december table start the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to mve would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below december december down basis points up basis points up basis points table end as of december the companys profile reflected a decrease of mve of for downward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points and an increase of for upward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points the asymmetrical sensitivity between up and down shock is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgagerelated products the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base largely nmds in downward parallel interest rate shocks mortgagerelated products prepayments increase their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited at the same time with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels the company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its nmd customers for upward parallel interest rate shocks extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the companys mortgagerelated products which are predominantly longterm and fixedrate and for larger shocks the loss in market value is not offset by the change in nmds limitations of interest rate risk analyses since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain the company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or mve actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume characteristics of new business behavior of existing positions and changes in market conditions and management strategies among other factors uses of derivatives to manage interest rate and other risks to mitigate interest rate risk and to a lesser extent foreign exchange equity and credit risks the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income the fair value of assets and liabilities and cash flows through the companys capital markets and mortgage banking activities it is subject to price risk the company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios in addition shusas board of directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities the level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements and will vary from period to period management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows these instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments the nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments the companys derivatives portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps as part of its overall business strategy the bank originates residential mortgages it sells a portion of this production to the fhlmc the fnma and private investors the company uses forward sales as a means of hedging against the economic impact of changes in interest rates on the mortgages that are originated for sale and on interest rate lock commitments the company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold the majority of the companys residential msrs are accounted for at fair value as deemed appropriate the company economically hedges msrs using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase mbs for additional information on msrs see note to the consolidated financial statements the company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities foreign exchange contracts which include spot and forward contracts represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreedupon price on an agreedupon settlement date exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate the company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales and equity options which manage its market risk associated with certain customer deposit products for additional information on foreign exchange contracts derivatives and hedging activities see note to the consolidated financial statements borrowings and other debt obligations the company has term loans and lines of credit with santander and other lenders the bank utilizes borrowings and other debt obligations as a source of funds for its asset growth and assetliability management the bank also utilizes repurchase agreements which are shortterm obligations collateralized by securities in addition sc has warehouse lines of credit and securitizes some of its rics and operating leases which are structured secured financings total borrowings and other debt obligations at december were billion compared to billion at december total borrowings decreased billion primarily due to a decrease in fhlb advances at the bank of billion and billion of debt maturities and calls partially offset by new debt issuances of billion and an overall increase in sc debt of billion see further detail on

as an analytical tool and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under gaap as set forth in the companys financial statements these limitations should be compensated for by relying primarily on the companys gaap results and using this nongaap information only as a supplement to evaluate the companys performance the company considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy these calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes because gaap does not include capital ratio measures the company believes that there are no comparable gaap financial measures to these ratios these ratios are not formally defined by gaap and are considered to be nongaap financial measures since analysts and banking regulators may assess the companys capital adequacy using these ratios the company believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis the company believes these nongaap measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these measures may allow readers to compare certain aspects of the companys capitalization to other organizations however because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios the companys calculations may not be directly comparable with those of other organizations and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited as a result the company encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure the following table includes
