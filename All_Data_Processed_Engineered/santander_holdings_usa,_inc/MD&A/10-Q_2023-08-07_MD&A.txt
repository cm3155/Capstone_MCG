institutions has led to increased market uncertainty the company was not materially impacted by these events during the quarter however changing market conditions are considered a significant risk factor to the company these factors will likely increase competition and pricing on customer deposits over the short and medium term heighten market and regulatory focus and reform on liquidity capital and interest rate risk and will likely result in a special assessment on banks to cover losses to the fdics deposit insurance fund which we estimate to be approximately million in total and

which no fico score was available while underwriting guidelines are designed to establish that the customer would be a reasonable credit risk nonprime loans will nonetheless experience higher default rates than a portfolio of obligations of prime customers additionally higher unemployment rates higher gasoline prices unstable real estate values resets of adjustable rate mortgages to higher interest rates the general availability of consumer credit and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could lead to an increase in delinquencies defaults and repossessions as well as decreased consumer demand for used automobiles and other consumer products weaken collateral values and increase losses in the event of default because of the historical focus for such credit has been predominantly on nonprime consumers the actual rates of delinquencies defaults repossessions and losses on these loans could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn the companys automated originations process for these credits reflects a disciplined approach to credit risk management to mitigate the risks of nonprime customers the companys robust historical data on both organically originated and acquired loans provides it with the ability to perform advanced loss forecasting each applicant is automatically assigned a proprietary custom score

during the respective periods the company generally considers an account delinquent when an obligor fails to pay substantially all defined as of the scheduled payment by the due date overall total delinquencies decreased by million from december to june the main driver of this is the decrease in past due auto loans in early stages of delinquency due to seasonal improvement in payment performance and credit normalization loan modifications loan modifications occur when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the loan is modified with terms that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower in these cases the company agrees to make certain concessions to both meet the needs of customers and maximize its ultimate recovery on the loans the types of concessions granted are generally interest rate reductions limitations on accrued interest charged term extensions covenant waivers and deferments of principal modified loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status upon modification unless the loan was performing immediately prior to modification for most portfolios modified loans may return to accrual status after a sustained period of repayment performance as long as the company believes the principal and interest of the restructured loan will be paid in full ric modifications are placed on nonaccrual status when the company believes repayment under the revised terms is not reasonably assured and at the latest when the account becomes more than dpd ric modifications are considered for return to accrual when the account becomes days or less past due to the extent the modified loan is determined to be collateraldependent and the source of repayment depends on the operation of the collateral the loan may be returned to accrual status based on the foregoing parameters to the extent the modified loan is determined to be collateraldependent and the source of repayment depends on disposal of the collateral the loan may not be returned to accrual status the company evaluates the results of its deferral strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred compared to the extent to which the collateral underlying the deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time based on this evaluation the company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio changes in deferral levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of consumer finance receivables chargedoff however the timing of a chargeoff may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a chargeoff to the extent deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is chargedoff historical chargeoff ratios and cash flow forecasts used in the determination of the adequacy of the alll for loans classified as modified are also impacted increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss confirmation period which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the portfolio and therefore increase the alll and related credit loss expense changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of the alll and related credit loss expense item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effective january the company adopted asu this guidance removes the specific accounting and disclosure guidance for tdr designations and enhances disclosure requirements related to modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty the company adopted the new guidance on

retained earnings of approximately million and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of approximately million refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on modified loans credit risk the risk inherent in the companys loan and lease portfolios is driven by credit and collateral quality and is affected by borrowerspecific and economywide factors such as changes in unemployment gdp hpi cre price index used vehicle index and other factors in general there is an inverse relationship between credit quality of transactions and projections of impairment losses so that transactions with better credit quality require a lower expected loss the company manages this risk through its underwriting pricing and credit approval guidelines and

results of operations asset and liability management interest rate risk interest rate risk arises primarily through the companys traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits many factors including economic and financial conditions movements in market interest rates and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities interest rate risk is managed by the companys treasury group and measured by its market risk department with oversight by the assetliability committee in managing interest rate risk the company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin to achieve these objectives the treasury group works closely with each business line in the company the treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk including wholesale funding maturity targeting investment portfolio purchase strategies asset securitizationssales and financial derivatives interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates basis risk repricing risk yield curve risk and option risk basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes such as differences in the extent of changes in federal funds rates compared with the threemonth term sofr repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing such as onemonth versus threemonth reset dates as well as the related maturities yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products these four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations shocks to those simulations and scenario and market value analyses and the subsequent results are reviewed by management several assumptions and models are used to produce these analyses including assumptions about new business volumes loan and investment prepayment rates deposit flows interest rate curves economic conditions and competitor pricing certain models use historical data analyses to estimate future customer behavior such as deposit repricing and attrition estimates from these models can differ from actual behavior depending on various factors such as macroeconomic conditions competitor response etc item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net interest income simulation analysis the company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense to estimate the companys net interest income sensitivity this simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the companys net interest income sensitivity these various scenarios include parallel nonparallel gradual parallel and gradual nonparallel rate shocks applied relative to the implied marketbased forward curve as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four measures of risk described above the shocks below are extended using the parallel scenario and are applied instantaneously to the implied forward curve as of the stated monthend the down basis point shock has been added as market rates have increased this set of shocks represents a range of plausible rate shocks as an instantaneous shock down basis points can be analogous to a gradual rampdown of basis points over one year this information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the companys risk position remains within shusa board of directorsapproved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates the table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the companys net interest income based on interest rate changes at june and december the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to net interest income would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below june december down basis points down basis points up basis points up basis points mve analysis the company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing mve modeling this analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet mve is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities the mve calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size balance sheet mix yield curve relationships or product spreads which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes management examines the effect of interest rate changes on mve the sensitivity of mve to changes in interest rates is a measure of longerterm interest rate risk and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates the following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the companys mve at june and december the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to mve would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below june december down basis points down basis points up basis points up basis points as of june the companys profile reflected an increase of mve of for downward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points and a decrease of for upward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points the asymmetrical sensitivity between a basis point increase and a basis point decrease is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgagerelated products the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base largely nmds in downward parallel interest rate shocks mortgagerelated products prepayments increase their duration decreases and their
