its subsidiaries during the period in june the federal reserve board announced the interim policy to be applied in the third quarter of which provided that certain large ccar banks including shusa cannot pay common stock dividends that exceed the institutions average trailing four quarters of net income the interim policy also prohibited these banks from implementing share purchase programs except to make share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock ownership plans in july sc announced that the federal reserve had approved certain exceptions to the

pch acquisition application after these responses shusa expects to be subject to the normal restriction imposed by the scb regulatory capital requirements us basel iii regulatory capital rules are applicable to both shusa and sbna these rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum riskbased capital ratios and prompt corrective action thresholds that require banking organizations including the company and sbna to maintain a minimum cet1 capital ratio of a tier capital ratio of a total capital ratio of and a minimum leverage ratio calculated as the ratio of tier capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter of a further capital conservation buffer of above these minimum ratios was phased in effective january this buffer is required for banking institutions to make capital distributions including paying dividends as described in note to these consolidated financial statements on january we adopted the cecl standard which upon adoption resulted in a reduction to our opening retained earnings balance net of income tax and an increase to the allowance for loan losses of approximately billion the us banking agencies in december approved a final rule to address the impact of cecl on regulatory capital by allowing banking organizations including the company the option to phase in the dayone impact of cecl until the first quarter of on march the us banking agencies issued an interim final rule that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years an estimate of cecls effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodologys effect on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period this interim rule was subsequently updated with technical amendments in a final rule dated september the company has elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the december rule see the bank regulatory capital section of this mda for the companys capital ratios under basel iii standards the implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the companys regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the company material restrictions can be imposed on sbna including restrictions on interest payable on accounts dismissal of management and in critically undercapitalized situations appointment of a receiver or conservator critically undercapitalized banks generally may not make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt and all but wellcapitalized banks are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval

ends stock redemptions or repurchases cashout mergers interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution at december sbna met the criteria to be classified as wellcapitalized on march the federal reserve adopted a final rule to simplify capital rules for large banks under the final rule firms supervisory stress test results are now used to establish the size of the scb requirement replacing the of the rwa component under the prior capital conservation buffer requirement the scb is calculated as the maximum decline in cet1 in the severely adverse scenario subject to a floor plus four quarters of dividends the rule results in new regulatory capital minimums which are equal to of cet1 plus the scb any gsib surcharge and any countercyclical capital buffer the gsib buffer is applicable only to the largest and most complex firms and does not apply to shusa in the event a firm falls below its new minimums the rule imposes restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses firms continue to submit a capital plan annually supervisory expectations for capital planning processes do not change under the final rule liquidity rules the federal reserve the fdic and the occ have established a rule to implement the basel iii lcr for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies and a modified version of the lcr for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active the lcr is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30day time horizon smaller covered companies more than billion in assets such as the company are required to calculate the lcr monthly in october the federal reserve finalized rules that tailor the liquidity requirements based on a companys asset size crossjurisdictional activity reliance on shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets and offbalance sheet exposure in light of the fact that the company is under billion in assets and has less than billion in shortterm wholesale funding the company is no longer required to disclose the us lcr resolution planning the dfa requires the company to prepare and update resolution plans the 165d resolution plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the us bankruptcy code and that no extraordinary support is received from the us or any other government the most recent 165d resolution plan was submitted to the federal reserve and fdic in december in addition under amended fdia rules the idi resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of billion or more develop a plan for its resolution that supports depositors rapid access to their insured deposits maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by creditors in resolution tlac the tlac rule requires certain us organizations to maintain a minimum amount of lossabsorbing instruments including a minimum amount of unsecured ltd the tlac rule applies to us gsibs and to ihcs with billion or more in us nonbranch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important fbo the company is such an ihc under the tlac rule companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of tlac which consists of a minimum amount of ltd and tier capital as a result shusa must hold the higher of of its rwas or of its total consolidated assets in the form of tlac of which of its rwas or of total consolidated assets must consist of ltd in addition shusa must maintain a tlac buffer composed solely of cet1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the tlac buffer it maintains the tlac rule became effective on january volcker rule section of the bhca commonly referred to as the volcker rule prohibits a banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a covered fund i acquiring or retaining any equity partnership or other ownership interest in the covered fund ii controlling the covered fund or iii engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the covered fund these prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities because the term banking entity includes an idi a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates the volcker rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as santander the company and certain of the companys subsidiaries including sbna and sc as well as other santander subsidiaries in the united states and abroad the company implemented certain policies and procedures training programs recordkeeping internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the volcker rule as required by the volcker rule the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and covered fund activities shusas compliance program includes among other things processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the volcker rule testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule in october the joint agencies responsible for administering the volcker rule finalized revisions to volcker rule the final rule tailors the volcker rules compliance requirements to the amount of a firms trading activity revise the definition of a trading account clarify certain key provisions in the volcker rule and simplify the information companies are required to provide the banking agencies in july the joint agencies finalized a rule that revised the volcker rule further the revisions provide an exemption for activities of qualifying foreign excluded funds revise the exclusions from the definition of a covered fund create new exclusions from the definition of a covered fund and modify the definition of an ownership interest the new rule became effective on october and the company is in the process of transitioning to the requirements of this revised rule risk retention rule the federal reserves final credit risk retention rule generally requires sponsors of abs to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing abs shusa primarily through sc is an active participant in the structured finance markets and complies with these retention requirements market risk rule the market risk rule requires certain national banks to measure and hold riskbased regulatory capital for the market risk of their covered positions the bank must measure and hold capital for its market risk using its internal risk based models the market risk rule outlines quantitative requirements for the banks internal risk based models as well as qualitative requirements for the banks management of market risk banks subject to the market risk rule must also measure and hold market risk regulatory capital for the specific risk associated with certain debt and equity positions a bank is subject to the market risk capi tal rules if its consolidated trading activity defined as the sum of trading assets and liabilities as reported in its ffiec and fr y for the previous quarter equals the lesser of percent or more of the banks total assets as reported in its call report and fr y for the previous quarter or billion or more at september sbna reported aggregate trading exposure in excess of the market risk threshold and as a result both the company and sbna began holding the market risk component within rwas of the riskbased capital ratios and submitted the ffiec market risk regulatory report beginning for the period ended december the incorporation of market risk within regulatory capital has resulted in a decrease in the companys riskbased capital ratios heightened standards occ guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions are commonly referred to as heightened standards the heightened standards apply to insured national banks with billion or more in consolidated assets the heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risktaking activities the heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework transactions with affiliates depository institutions must remain in compliance with sections and of the federal reserve act and the federal reserves regulation w which governs transactions between sbna and affiliated companies and

relocating branches and the federal reserve does the same with respect to certain regulatory applications the company makes reference rate reform the march announcement by the uks financial conduct authority confirmed the unavailability of libor rates beyond june and cessation of oneweek and twomonth libor by december isda announced these statements are an index cessation event under the ibor fallbacks supplement and the isda ibor fallbacks protocol which in turn triggers a spread adjustment fixing date under the bloomberg ibor fallback rate adjustments rule book as a result when libor tenors cease and the fallback rates apply fallbacks for derivatives under isdas documentation shift to forms of the sofr plus the fixed spread adjustment the regulatory agencies also confirmed that the march announcements constitute a benchmark transition event with respect to all libor settings we hold loans derivatives and other financial instruments that use libor as a reference rate and that will be impacted by the cessation of libor transition away from libor to new reference rates presents legal financial reputational and operational risks to the company as well as to other participants in the market as of december the company had approximately billion of loans and approximately billion of borrowings with libor exposure we also had approximately billion in notional amounts of derivative contracts with libor exposure under the guidance of our crossfunctional libor transition program the company began offering products linked to alternative reference rates and has progressed on remediating existing contracts that use the libor reference rate we substantially limited originations of new liborreferenced products as of december on january we ceased originations of new liborreferenced products that do not fall under approved us categories limited exceptions with fallbacks may be granted for limited use of libor in if clients are unready or unprepared for alternative

execution on remediation of remaining models accounting and tax implemented relevant fasb and irs guidance documented approach to hedging systems completed technology systems updates and testing to support alternative reference rates critical accounting estimates this mda is based on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes that have been prepared in accordance with gaap the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates assumptions and judgments and accordingly have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported however the company is not currently aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results management identified accounting for alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments estimates of expected residual values of leased vehicles subject to operating leases goodwill and fair value measurements as the companys most critical accounting estimates in that they are important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain acl and reserve for unfunded lending commitments the company maintains an acl for the companys heldforinvestment portfolio excluding those loans measured at fair value in accordance with applicable accounting standards as described in note and note to the consolidated financial statements the acl is measured using the current expected credit loss model which is based on information derived from historical experience current conditions and prospective information that requires the use of significant judgment by management the model includes both quantitative and qualitative factors with key inputs from unemployment data the housing price index gdp growth rates and used vehicle index growth rates along with certain loan level characteristics all used to predict the likelihood of borrower default management applies qualitative factors to capture risks not addressed by the key inputs such as temporary or recent unique market disruptions impacting trends in delinquencies and used vehicle prices while management uses the best information available to make such evaluations future adjustments to the acl may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from these assumptions used in making the evaluations the company generally uses a thirdparty vendors consensus baseline macroeconomic scenario for the quantitative estimate and additional positive and negative macroeconomic scenarios to make qualitative adjustments for macroeconomic uncertainty and considers adjustments to macroeconomic inputs and outputs based on market volatility the baseline scenario was based on the latest consensus forecasts available which showed an improvement in key variables in the fourth quarter of including a sharp decrease in unemployment rates which are a key driver to losses the unemployment rate and used vehicle price index which is a measure of wholesale used car price trends are considered the most significant variables using the weightedaverage of a range of economic forecast scenarios we estimated at december that the unemployment rate is expected to be approximately at the end of with the labor market continuing to recover in in comparison at january management previously estimated the unemployment rate using the weightedaverage of our economic forecast scenarios to be at the end of additionally the used vehicle index where a higher number corresponds to a higher used car price at auction is estimated at december to be approximately at the end of compared to our estimate at january to be approximately at the end of while the economy has seen significant recovery in recent months there is still considerable uncertainty regarding overall lifetime loss estimates the scenarios used are periodically updated over a reasonable and supportable time horizon with weightings assigned by management and approved through established committee governance under the range of economic forecast scenarios considered based on applying a weighting to the most negative scenario used and without considering the impact of corresponding or offsetting qualitative factors that could have a significant impact on the overall acl the acl would have been higher by approximately billion this range reflects the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses specifically related to the scenarios and weights considered as of december and does not consider other potential adjustments that could increase or decrease loss estimates calculated using alternative economic scenarios management reviews updates and validates its process and loss assumptions on a periodic basis this process involves an analysis of data integrity review of loss and credit trends a retrospective evaluation of actual loss information to loss forecasts and other analyses valuation of automotive lease assets and residuals the company has significant investments in vehicles in its operating lease portfolio in accounting for operating leases management must make a determination at the beginning of the lease contract of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term which typically ranges from two to four years at contract inception the company determines the projected residual value based on an internal evaluation of the expected future value this evaluation is based on a proprietary model using internallygenerated data that is compared against thirdparty independent data for reasonableness the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a finance charge however since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract the company is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of leased vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of leased assets to account for residual risk the company depreciates automobile operating lease assets to estimated realizable value on a straightline basis over the lease term the estimated realizable value is initially based on the residual value established at contract inception if the estimated realizable value of a leased vehicle subsequently declines below the residual value at contract inception additional depreciation expense is recorded periodically the company revises the estimated realizable value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and other relevant data points and adjusts depreciation expense appropriately over the remaining term of the lease the company periodically evaluates its investment in operating leases for impairment if circumstances such as a systemic and material decline in used vehicle values occurs these circumstances could include for example a decline in the residual value of our lease portfolio due to an event caused by shocks to oil and gas prices which may have a pronounced impact on certain models of vehicles or pervasive manufacturer defects which may systemically affect the value of a particular brand or model impairment is determined to exist if the fair value of the leased asset is less than its carrying value and it is determined that the net carrying value is not recoverable the net carrying value of a leased asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from the leas e payments and the estimated residual value upon eventual disposition if our operating lease assets are considered to be impaired the impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value as estimated by dcf no such impairment was recognized in or the companys depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers managements expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values the critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automobile lease assets include estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values proper identification and estimation of business conditions our remarketing abilities and automobile manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the value of the lease residuals expected residual values include estimates of payments from automobile manufacturers related to residual support and risksharing agreements if any to the extent an automotive manufacturer is not able to fully honor its obligation relative to these agreements the companys depreciation expense would be negatively impacted if the estimated realizable values of our leased vehicles were to decline below contractual residual values depreciation expense at sc would increase by approximately million over the remaining life of the current lease portfolio goodwill the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities represents goodwill goodwill is not amortized on a recurring basis but rather is subject to periodic impairment testing the company conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis on october and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value as more fully described in note to the companys consolidated financial statements a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below as of december the reporting units with assigned goodwill were cbb ci cre vf cib and sc the evaluation of goodwill impairment requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount including allocated goodwill determining the fair value of reporting units requires significant valuation inputs assumptions and estimates the company determines the carrying value of each reporting unit using a riskbased capital approach certain of the companys assets are assigned to a corporateother category these assets are related to the companys corporateonly programs such as boli and are not employed in or related to the operations of a reporting unit or considered in determining the fair value of a reporting unit goodwill impairment testing involves managements judgment requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value this is performed using widelyaccepted valuation techniques such as the guideline public company market approach market approach and the income approach the dcf method the company uses a combination of these accepted methodologies to determine the fair valuation of reporting units several factors are taken into account including actual operating results future business plans economic projections and market data the market approach includes earnings and pricetotangible book value multiples of comparable public companies which were applied to the earnings and equity for all of the companys reporting units except sc for the sc reporting unit a qualitative assessment was deemed to be sufficient and reasonable the result of this assessment indicated it was probable that the fair value of the sc reporting unit continues to exceed its carrying value and therefore management determined that a full goodwill impairment test was not warranted for the sc reporting unit the company performed a qualitative analysis based primarily on the evaluation of the reporting units carrying value in comparison to the value represented by shusas proposal to acquire scs shares at a price of per share as well as the quoted share price as of the impairment test date the dcf method of the income approach incorporates the reporting units forecasted cash flows including a terminal value to estimate the fair value of cash flows beyond the final year of the forecasts the discount rates utilized to obtain the net present value of the reporting units cash flows were estimated using a capital asset pricing model significant inputs to this model include a riskfree rate of return beta which is a measure of the level of nondiversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit market equity risk premium and in certain cases additional premium for size andor unsystematic companyspecific risk factors the company utilized discount rates that it believes adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets the company estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and riskreturn rates for similar industries of the reporting unit the company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows so actual results may differ from forecasted results when calculating the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach short and mediumterm forecasts incorporated current economic conditions including the ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic longterm cash flow projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments as well as a longterm rate of return for each reporting unit in primarily due to the ongoing economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of billion and billion in the cbb and ci reporting units respectively the cre vf reporting units estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than the goodwill allocated to these reporting units is sensitive to impairment as the valuation is highly correlated with forecasted interest rates credit costs and other factors in light of the significant market volatility arising from the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the responses to the pandemic from multiple government agencies in the company determined to give only a weighting to the market approach in estimating the second quarter fair value of cbb ci and cre vf the company continued to analyze implied market multiples to support the valuation under the market approach no goodwill impairment was recorded in at the conclusion of the annual assessment it was determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value primarily due to an improvement in the short and medium term economic forecasts in response to the stabilization of the economy the company returned to its prepandemic equal weighting of the income and market approach additionally projections on longterm growth rate increased from depressed projections in resulting in higher fair values under the income approach to factor in returning market stability the company also returned its control premium assumption to consistent with its pre2020 valuations all of the preceding fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors as a result there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions in the future examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the reporting units include such items as a prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates and unexpected regulatory changes refer to the financial condition goodwill section of this mda for further details on the companys goodwill including the results of managements goodwill impairment analyses fair value measurements the company uses fair value measurements to estimate the fair value of certain assets and liabilities for both measurement and disclosure purposes refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized the company follows the fair value hierarchy set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value the company reviews and modifies as necessary the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis accordingly there may be reclassifications between hierarchy levels due to changes in inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value the company has numerous internal controls in place to ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurements certain valuations are benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available considerable judgment is used in forming conclusions from observable market data used to estimate the companys level fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to the companys internal valuation models used to estimate level fair value measurements level inputs such as interest rate movements prepayment speeds credit losses recovery rates and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements accordingly the companys estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would be paid in a current market exchange results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item financial statements and supplementary data this section of the annual report on there have been no

contributed million to shusa sp declared and paid million in dividends to shusa asset and liability management interest rate risk interest rate risk arises primarily through the companys traditional business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits many factors including economic and financial conditions movements in market interest rates and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities interest rate risk is managed by the companys treasury group and measured by its market risk department with oversight by the assetliability committee in managing interest rate risk the company seeks to minimize the variability of net interest income across various likely scenarios while at the same time maximizing net interest income and the net interest margin to achieve these objectives the treasury group works closely with each business line in the company the treasury group also uses various other tools to manage interest rate risk including wholesale funding maturity targeting investment portfolio purchase strategies asset securitizationssales and financial derivatives interest rate risk focuses on managing four elements of risk associated with interest rates basis risk repricing risk yield curve risk and option risk basis risk stems from rate index timing differences with rate changes such as differences in the extent of changes in federal funds rates compared with the threemonth libor repricing risk stems from the different timing of contractual repricing such as onemonth versus threemonth reset dates as well as the related maturities yield curve risk stems from the impact on earnings and market value resulting from different shapes and levels of yield curves option risk stems from prepayment or early withdrawal risk embedded in various products these four elements of risk are analyzed through a combination of net interest income and balance sheet valuation simulations shocks to those simulations and scenario and market value analyses and the subsequent results are reviewed by management numerous assumptions are made to produce these analyses including assumptions about new business volumes loan and investment prepayment rates deposit flows interest rate curves economic conditions and competitor pricing net interest income simulation analysis the company utilizes a variety of measurement techniques to evaluate the impact of interest rate risk including simulating the impact of changing interest rates on expected future interest income and interest expense to estimate the companys net interest income sensitivity this simulation is run monthly and includes various scenarios that help management understand the potential risks in the companys net interest income sensitivity these scenarios include both parallel and nonparallel rate shocks as well as other scenarios that are consistent with quantifying the four elements of risk described above this information is used to develop proactive strategies to ensure that the companys risk position remains within shusa board of directorsapproved limits so that future earnings are not significantly adversely affected by future interest rates the table below reflects the estimated sensitivity to the companys net interest income based on interest rate changes at december and december table start the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to net interest income would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below december december down basis points up basis points up basis points table end mve analysis the company also evaluates the impact of interest rate risk by utilizing mve modeling this analysis measures the present value of all estimated future cash flows of the company over the estimated remaining life of the balance sheet mve is calculated as the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities the mve calculation utilizes only the current balance sheet and therefore does not factor in any future changes in balance sheet size balance sheet mix yield curve relationships or product spreads which may mitigate the impact of any interest rate changes management examines the effect of interest rate changes on mve the sensitivity of mve to changes in interest rates is a measure of longerterm interest rate risk and highlights the potential capital at risk due to adverse changes in market interest rates the following table discloses the estimated sensitivity to the companys mve at december and december table start the following estimated percentage increasedecrease to mve would result if interest rates changed in parallel by the amounts below december december down basis points up basis points up basis points table end as of december the companys profile reflected a decrease of mve of for downward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points and a decrease of for upward parallel interest rate shocks of basis points the asymmetrical sensitivity between up and down shock is due to the negative convexity as a result of the prepayment option embedded in mortgagerelated products the impact of which is not fully offset by the behavior of the funding base largely nmds in downward parallel interest rate shocks mortgagerelated products prepayments increase their duration decreases and their market value appreciation is therefore limited at the same time with deposit rates remaining at comparatively low levels the company cannot effectively transfer interest rate declines to its nmd customers for upward parallel interest rate shocks extension risk weighs on a sizable portion of the companys mortgagerelated products which are predominantly longterm and fixedrate and for larger shocks the loss in market value is not offset by the change in nmds limitations of interest rate risk analyses since the assumptions used are inherently uncertain the company cannot predict precisely the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or mve actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes the difference between actual experience and the assumed volume characteristics of new business behavior of existing positions and changes in market conditions and management strategies among other factors uses of derivatives to manage interest rate and other risks to mitigate interest rate risk and to a lesser extent foreign exchange equity and credit risks the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income the fair value of assets and liabilities and cash flows through the companys capital markets and mortgage banking activities it is subject to price risk the company employs various tools to measure and manage price risk in its portfolios in addition shusas board of directors has established certain limits relative to positions and activities the level of price risk exposure at any point in time depends on the market environment and expectations of future price and market movements and will vary from period to period management uses derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate movements on the fair value of certain liabilities assets and highly probable forecasted cash flows these instruments primarily include interest rate swaps that have underlying interest rates based on key benchmark indices and forward sale or purchase commitments the nature and volume of the derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk depend on the level and type of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and the risk management strategies for the current and anticipated interest rate environments the companys derivatives portfolio includes mortgage banking interest rate lock commitments forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps as part of its overall business strategy sbna originates residential mortgages it sells a portion of this production to the fhlmc the fnma and private investors the company uses forward sales as a means of hedging against the economic impact of changes in interest rates on the mortgages that are originated for sale and on interest rate lock commitments the company typically retains the servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans that are sold the majority of the companys residential msrs are accounted for at fair value as deemed appropriate the company economically hedges msrs using interest rate swaps and forward contracts to purchase mbs for additional information on msrs see note to the consolidated financial statements the company uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities foreign exchange contracts which include spot and forward contracts represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreedupon price on an agreedupon settlement date exposure to gains and losses on these contracts increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate the company also utilizes forward contracts to manage market risk associated with certain expected investment securities sales for additional information on foreign exchange contracts derivatives and hedging activities see note to the consolidated financial statements nongaap financial measures the companys nongaap information has limitations as an analytical tool and therefore should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any performance measures under gaap as set forth in the companys financial statements these limitations should be compensated for by relying primarily on the companys gaap results and using this nongaap information only as a supplement to evaluate the companys performance the company considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy these calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes because gaap does not include capital ratio measures the company believes that there are no comparable gaap financial measures to these ratios these ratios are not formally defined by gaap and are considered to be nongaap financial measures since analysts and banking regulators may assess the companys capital adequacy using these ratios the company believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis the company believes these nongaap measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these measures may allow readers to compare certain aspects of the companys capitalization to other organizations however because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios the companys calculations may not be directly comparable with those of other organizations and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited as a result the company encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial
