category the ratio of commercial loan and lease net chargeoffs to average portfolio commercial loans and leases increased to bps during the year ended december compared to bps during the year ended december the increase was primarily due to increases in net chargeoffs on commercial and industrial loans and commercial mortgage loans of million and million respectively the ratio of consumer loan net chargeoffs to average portfolio consumer loans decreased to bps for the year ended december compared to bps for the year ended december the decrease was primarily due to decreases in net chargeoffs on indirect secured consumer loans and other consumer loans of million and million respectively the decreases for the year ended december included the impact of government stimulus programs

credit losses the allowance for credit losses is comprised of the alll and the reserve for unfunded commitments as further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements the bancorp adopted asu on january which established a new approach for estimating credit losses on certain types of financial instruments after adoption of this amended guidance the bancorp maintains the alll to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases as adjusted for prepayments and reasonably expected tdrs the bancorps methodology for determining the alll includes an estimate of fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated for collectively evaluated loans and leases the bancorp uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default the bancorps expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience current market and economic conditions and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable the bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the alll qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses which are not fully captured within the bancorps expected credit loss models these factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting monitoring or collections lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews in addition the qualitative adjustment framework can be utilized to address specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events natural disasters or changes in current economic conditions that are not reflected in the quantitative credit loss models and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the bancorps expected credit loss models such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the accounting policies for the alll and reserve for unfunded commitments for periods prior to january in addition to the alll the bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets the methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the bancorps methodology for determining the alll the provision for unfunded commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income for the commercial portfolio segment the estimates for probability of default are primarily based on internal ratings assigned to each commercial borrower on a 13point scale and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions for loans with available credit the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions the estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions for collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments the bancorps expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrowers fico score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default the estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions the expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms such as residential mortgage loans and home equity and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges such as credit card and home equity the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions day adoption impact upon adoption of asu on january the bancorp used three forwardlooking economic scenarios during the reasonable and supportable forecast period in its expected credit loss models to address the inherent imprecision in macroeconomic forecasting each of the three scenarios was developed by a third party that is subject to the bancorps thirdparty risk management program including oversight by the bancorps independent model risk management group the scenarios included a most likely outcome baseline and two less probable scenarios with one being more favorable than the baseline and the other being less favorable the more favorable alternative scenario upside depicted a stronger nearterm growth outlook while the less favorable outlook downside depicted a moderate recession the baseline scenario was assigned a probability weighting of with each of the upside and downside scenarios being assigned a weighting the baseline scenario was developed such that the expectation is that the economy will perform better than the projection of the time and worse than the projection of the time the upside scenario was developed such that there is a probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a probability that it will perform worse the downside scenario was developed such that there is a probability that the economy will perform better than the projection and a probability that it will perform worse december acl the acl as of december was impacted by several factors including general improvement in the economic outlook as a result the bancorp incorporated a combination of quantitative modelbased estimates and qualitative overlays for the quantitative estimates the bancorp incorporated three scenarios developed by the third party in november that included estimates of the expected impacts of the changes in economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic the baseline scenario was assigned a probability weighting of with a more favorable scenario upside assigned a probability weighting of and a less favorable scenario downside assigned a probability of the baseline scenario utilized by the bancorp assumes additional stimulus enacted in the first quarter of including fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unemployment and individual benefits but no aid to state and local governments gdp growth is expected to be at a annualized rate in and at a annualized rate in the baseline scenario also assumes a unemployment rate through the fourth quarter of with an average unemployment rate of in the first half of the upside scenario assumes that the covid19 crisis resolves sooner than anticipated with businesses returning to full operation sooner than expected and an increase in consumer spending in this scenario housing prices rise by compared to in the baseline during upside real gdp growth is expected to be in and a fullemployment rate is expected to be achieved by mid2022 a year earlier than baseline the downside scenario reflects no additional federal fiscal stimulus which causes an increase in unemployment to above by the end of this scenario shows annual average gdp growth of in and in and housing prices decreasing by through the bancorps quantitative credit loss models are sensitive to changes in economic forecast assumptions over the reasonable and supportable forecast period applying a probability weighting to the downside scenario rather than using the probabilityweighted three scenario approach would result in an increase in the quantitative acl of approximately million this sensitivity calculation only reflects the impact of changing the probability weighting of the scenarios in the quantitative credit loss models and excludes any additional considerations associated with the qualitative component of the acl that might be warranted in the circumstance at december the qualitative component of the acl included consideration of certain factors that represent emerging risks specifically associated with the current economic environment and the covid19 pandemic these considerations resulted in qualitative adjustments to increase the acl primarily related to volatility in shortterm unemployment rates commercial borrowers experiencing prolonged distress commercial borrowers in certain industries which have been severely impacted by the covid19 pandemic and consumer borrowers that deferred contractual payments under covid19

commitments on january of approximately million upon the adoption of asu the increase in the alll at the date of adoption was primarily attributable to longer duration home equity and residential mortgage loans the bancorps alll may vary significantly from period to period after the adoption date as it will be based on changes in economic conditions economic forecasts and the composition and credit quality of the bancorps loan and lease portfolio the adoption of asu will also have an impact on the provision for credit losses in periods after adoption which could differ materially from historical trends for additional information on asu refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations interest rate and price risk management interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates this risk primarily impacts the bancorps income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and the cost of interestbearing liabilities and through fee items that are related to interest sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income and through earnings credits earned on commercial deposits that offset commercial deposit fees price risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of financial instruments and portfolios due to movements in interest rates volatilities foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times shortterm and longterm market interest rates change by different amounts or the expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change in addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on nii and interestsensitive fees interest rates can impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand credit losses mortgage origination volumes the value of servicing rights and other sources of the bancorps earnings changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact earnings through changes in the value of portfolios if not appropriately hedged stability of the bancorps net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk and to a lesser extent price risk management continually reviews the bancorps on and offbalance sheet composition earnings flows and hedging strategies and models interest rate risk and price risk exposures and possible actions to manage these risks given numerous possible future interest rate and market factor scenarios a series of policy limits and key risk indicators are employed to ensure that risks are managed within the bancorps risk tolerance for interest rate risk and price risk in addition to the traditional forms of interest rate risk discussed in this section the bancorp is exposed to interest rate risk associated with the retirement and replacement of libor for more information on the libor transition refer to the overview section of mda the commercial and wealth and asset management lines of business manage price risk for capital markets sales and trading activities related to their respective businesses the mortgage line of business manages price risk for the origination and sale of conforming residential mortgage loans to government agencies and governmentsponsored enterprises the bancorps treasury department manages interest rate risk and price risk for all other activities independent oversight is provided by erm and key risk indicators and boardapproved policy limits are used to ensure risks are managed within the bancorps risk tolerance the bancorps market risk management committee which includes senior management representatives is accountable to the ermc provides oversight and monitors price risk for the capital markets sales and trading activities the bancorps alco which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ermc provides oversight and monitors interest rate and price risks for mortgage and treasury activities net interest income sensitivity the bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk including the use of an nii simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of nii to changes in interest rates the model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the bancorps assets liabilities and offbalance sheet exposures and incorporates marketbased assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities the model also includes senior managements projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes deviations from projected assumptions as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies as of december the bancorps interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in nii over 12month and 24month horizons assuming a bps parallel ramped increase in interest rates given the unlikely probability associated with a potential negative rate environment the bancorp does not have a policy limit for scenarios that include negative rates therefore the bancorp has no policy limit for a scenario with a decrease in interest rates currently in effect as the federal funds target range is currently between zero and basis points however the bancorp routinely analyzes various potential and extreme scenarios including ramps shocks and nonparallel shifts in rates including negative rate scenarios to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve additionally the bancorp routinely evaluates its exposures to changes in the bases between interest rates the ongoing covid19 pandemic has caused significant changes to interest rates volatilities and the composition of the bancorps balance sheet including significant increases in deposit funding related to stimulus programs which has resulted in an excess liquidity position the excess liquidity is likely to continue negatively impacting net interest margin if shortterm interest rates hold steady or move lower but may be partially offset by the amortization of fees related to ppp loans and investment opportunities should the yield curve continue steepening in order to recognize the risk of noninterestbearing demand deposit balance runoff in a rising interest rate environment the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling assumes that approximately billion of additional demand deposit balances runoff over months above what is included in senior managements baseline projections for each bps increase in shortterm market interest rates similarly the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately billion of incremental growth in noninterestbearing deposit balances over months fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations above senior managements baseline projections for each bps decrease in shortterm market interest rates the incremental balance runoff and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with shortterm market rate changes and reflect the banks excess liquidity position another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interestbearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease this deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta and it represents the expected amount by which bancorp deposit rates will change for a given change in shortterm market rates the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling assumes a weightedaverage risingrate interestbearing deposit beta of at december which is approximately to percentage points higher than the average beta that the bancorp experienced in the frb tightening cycles from june to june and from december to december in the event of further rate cuts by the frb into negative territory the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling assumes a weightedaverage fallingrate interestbearing deposit beta of at december while maintaining that deposit rates themselves will not become negative in addition the modeling assumes there is no lag between the timing of changes in market rates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred in prior rate cycles the bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions the bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixedrate customer liabilities the following table shows the bancorps estimated nii sensitivity profile and alco policy limits as of december table start table estimated nii sensitivity profile and alco policy limits change in nii fte alco policy limits change in nii fte alco policy limits change in interest rates bps months months months months months months months months ramp over months ramp over months na na na na ramp over months na na na na na na ramp over months na na na na table end at december the bancorps nii would benefit in both year one and year two under the parallel rate ramp increases the bancorp maintains an asymmetric nii sensitivity profile which is attributable to the level of floatingrate assets including the predominantly floatingrate commercial loan portfolio exceeding the level of floatingrate liabilities due to the increased amount of deposit rates near zero in this low interest rate environment and other fixedrate borrowings reductions in the yield of the commercial loan portfolio would be expected to be only partially offset by a decline in the cost of interestbearing deposits in a fallingrate scenario however proactive management of the securities and derivatives portfolios has reduced the ongoing nearterm risk to declining market rates and provided significant protection from the decline in rates experienced as the covid19 pandemic unfolded the changes in the estimated nii sensitivity profile compared to december were primarily attributable to the impact of the current nearzero interest rate environment on the previously discussed interest rate profile and the significant increase in noninterestbearing and lowcost interestbearing deposits the down rate scenarios were also impacted by the higher composition of lowcost deposits hitting their floor rates more quickly in the currentyear scenarios due to the lowrate environment tables and provide the sensitivity of the bancorps estimated nii profile at december to changes to certain deposit balance and deposit repricing sensitivity betas assumptions the following table includes the bancorps

betas of and respectively economic value of equity sensitivity the bancorp also uses eve as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk whereas the nii sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted nii on an fte basis nongaap over one and twoyear time horizons eve is a pointintime analysis of the economic sensitivity of current positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives the eve of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows due to this longer horizon the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longerterm interest rate risk eve values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the balance growth assumptions used in the nii sensitivity analysis as with the nii simulation model assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the eve analysis particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of indeterminatelived deposits the following table shows the bancorps estimated eve sensitivity profile as of december table start table estimated eve sensitivity profile change in interest rates bps change in eve alco policy limit change in eve alco policy limit shock shock na na shock na na na shock na na table end the eve sensitivity is neutral in a bps risingrate scenario at december the changes in the estimated eve sensitivity profile from december were primarily related to the lowrate environment growth in noninterestbearing and lowcost interestbearing deposits and the shorter expected lives of prepayable fixedrate assets due to the decrease in market interest rates these items were partially offset by continued repositioning of the investment portfolio into securities with less principal cash flows in the near term while an instantaneous shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure the bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon eg the current fiscal year further eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates the nii simulations and eve analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates the bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast libor prime rate and other basis risks yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks in addition the impacts on nii on an fte basis and eve of extreme changes in interest rates are modeled wherein the bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environmentspecific scenarios use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk an integral component of the bancorps interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates examples of derivative instruments that the bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps interest rate floors interest rate caps forward contracts forward starting interest rate swaps options swaptions and tba securities tables and show all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing the bancorps exposures to the variability of interest rates these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations notional amounts to another interest rate index or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as the bancorp adjusts its broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for further information including the notional amount and fair values of these

activities the bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as freestanding derivatives to economically hedge irlcs that are also considered freestanding derivatives the bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options as well see the residential mortgage servicing rights and price risk section for the discussion of the use of derivatives to economically hedge this exposure the bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers generally these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the bancorp from market volatility credit risk arises from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts which the bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements approvals limits and monitoring procedures the bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers these controls include an independent determination of interest rate volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management for further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements portfolio loans and leases and interest rate risk although the bancorps portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floatingadjustablerate products the rates of interest earned by the bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time the interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the

not exercise its option to repurchase residential mortgage servicing rights and price risk the fair value of the residential msr portfolio was million and million at december and december respectively the value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors generally as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans the bancorp maintains a nonqualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its msr portfolio as a result of changing interest rates mortgage rates decreased during the years ended december and which caused modeled prepayment speeds to rise the fair value of the msr portfolio decreased million and million respectively due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and oas assumptions and decreased million and million respectively due to the impact of contractual principal payments and actual prepayment activity for the years ended december and the bancorp recognized net gains of million and million respectively on its nonqualifying hedging strategy during the years ended december and these amounts included net gains of million

financial condition and results of operations liquidity risk management the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits a summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements the bancorps treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on pointintime metrics as well as forwardlooking projections which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the treasury department with independent oversight provided by erm and a series of policy limits and key risk indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the bancorps risk tolerance the bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions time horizons asset growth rates and other events the contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity the contingency plan also outlines the bancorps response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios liquidity risk is monitored and managed for both fifth third bancorp and its subsidiaries the bancorp receives substantially all of its liquidity from dividends from its subsidiaries primarily fifth third bank national association subsidiary dividends are supplemented with term debt to enable the bancorp to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations including debt service and scheduled maturities common and preferred dividends unfunded commitments to subsidiaries and other planned capital actions in the form of share repurchases liquidity resources are more limited at the bancorp making its liquidity position more susceptible to market disruptions bancorp liquidity is assessed using a cash coverage horizon ensuring the entity maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a period of sustained market disruption while meeting its anticipated obligations over an extended stressed horizon the bancorps alco which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ermc monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within boardapproved policy limits in addition to the risk management activities of alco the bancorp has a liquidity risk management function as part of erm that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management sources of funds the bancorps primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments payments from securities related to sales and maturities the sale or
