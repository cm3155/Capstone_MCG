accounting policies include the accounting for the alll reserve for unfunded commitments valuation of servicing rights fair value measurements goodwill and legal contingencies these accounting policies are discussed in detail in the critical accounting policies section of the bancorps annual report on form 10k for the year ended december there have been no material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the nine months ended september managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued statements of income analysis net interest income net interest income is the interest earned on loans and leases including yieldrelated fees securities and other shortterm investments less the interest incurred on core deposits includes transaction deposits and other time deposits and wholesale funding includes certificates and over other deposits federal funds purchased other shortterm borrowings and longterm debt the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interestearning assets net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by noninterestbearing liabilities or free funding such as demand deposits or shareholders equity tables and present the components of net interest income net interest margin and net interest rate spread

programs have continued to adversely impact market rates since march of yields on total average loans and leases decreased by bps for the nine months ended september compared to the same period in the prior year driven by decreases in yields on average commercial loans and leases and average consumer loans of bps and bps respectively the bancorp has significant portfolios of floating interest rate loans primarily libor or primebased that were impacted by decreases in benchmark interest rates the bancorps portfolios of fixed interest rate loans also decreased in yield as a result of increased

reserves held at the frb reported in other shortterm investments which were primarily driven by increased levels in average demand deposits and average interestbearing core deposits for the nine months ended september compared to the same period in the prior year net interest margin results are expected to remain suppressed as a result of sustained excess cash balances which are expected to
