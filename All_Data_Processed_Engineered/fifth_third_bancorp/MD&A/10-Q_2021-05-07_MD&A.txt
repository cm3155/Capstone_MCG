trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the bancorp as discussed later in the risk management section of mda risk identification measurement monitoring control

assets such as loans leases and securities and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits other shortterm borrowings and longterm debt net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates the relative level of shortterm and longterm interest rates changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities generally the rates of interest the bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time the change in market interest rates over time exposes the bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position the bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates additionally in the ordinary course of business the bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks the bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral noninterest income is derived from

commercial banking branch banking consumer lending and wealth and asset management additional information on each business segment is included in note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements results of the bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices the structure and accounting practices are specific to the bancorp therefore the financial results of the bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions the bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as managements accounting practices and businesses change the bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level by employing an ftp methodology the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits the ftp methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities respectively based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction assigning the ftp rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates the bancorps ftp methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the assetgenerating and depositproviding businesses on a durationadjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance as the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched the residual impact of the ftp methodology is captured in general corporate and other the charge and credit rates are determined using the ftp rate curve which is based on an estimate of fifth thirds marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets the ftp curve is constructed using the us swap curve brokered cd pricing and unsecured debt pricing the bancorp adjusts the ftp charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminatelived deposits key assumptions including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts are reviewed annually credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions in general the charge rates on assets have declined since december as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio the credit rates for deposit products also modestly declined due to lower interest rates and modified assumptions thus net interest income for assetgenerating business segments improved while depositproviding business segments were negatively impacted during the three months ended march the bancorps methodology for allocating provision for credit losses expense to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net chargeoffs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment provision for credit losses expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in alll factors is captured in general corporate and other the financial results of the business segments include
