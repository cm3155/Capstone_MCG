noninterest income for the three months ended march net interest income on an fte basis and noninterest income provided and of total revenue respectively the bancorp derives the majority of its revenues within the us from customers domiciled in the us revenue from foreign countries and external customers domiciled in foreign countries was immaterial to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended march changes in interest rates credit quality economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the bancorp as discussed later in the risk management section of mda risk identification measurement monitoring control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the bancorp net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans leases and securities and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits other shortterm borrowings and longterm debt net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates the relative level of shortterm and longterm interest rates changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities generally the rates of interest the bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time the change in market interest rates over time exposes the bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position the bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates additionally in the ordinary course of business the bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks the bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral noninterest income is derived from service charges on deposits wealth and asset management revenue commercial banking revenue card and processing revenue leasing business revenue mortgage banking net revenue other noninterest income and net securities gains or losses noninterest expense includes compensation and benefits technology

pandemic created significant economic uncertainty and financial disruptions during the years ended december and and this uncertainty has continued into government and public responses to the covid19 pandemic including temporary closures of businesses and the implementation of social distancing protocols caused reductions and instability in economic activity that resulted in increased unemployment levels in certain industries and volatility in the financial markets markets continue to remain volatile as a result of the pandemic and its evolving impacts including inflationary concerns as well as stresses in labor markets and supply chains during the years ended december and low interest rates reduced economic activity and market volatility had the most immediate negative impacts on the bancorps performance the bancorp is unable to estimate the extent of the impact that these factors have had on its operating results since the pandemic began and these factors may adversely impact its future operating results managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued although the increased availability of covid19 vaccinations began to mitigate the public health effects of the pandemic there has been a rise of certain variants of covid19 and slowing progress on vaccination rates the recovery from the related economic crisis disproportionately affected certain industries geographies and demographics more than others and when combined with the unprecedented nature of the government response to the pandemic it becomes difficult to predict the extent to which the pandemic will continue to adversely impact the bancorp and its customers furthermore resurgence risk remains as new virus variants are identified the bancorp continues to closely monitor the pandemic and its effects on customers employees communities and markets for further discussion on current economic conditions refer to the credit risk management subsection of the risk management section of mda libor transition in july the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the fca which regulates libor announced that the fca will stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the administrator of libor after since then central banks around the world including the federal reserve have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for libor on march the fca and ice benchmark administration limited announced that the publication of the oneweek and twomonth usd libor maturities and nonusd libor maturities would cease immediately after december with the remaining usd libor maturities ceasing immediately after june in the united states the alternative rates reference committee the arrc a group of market participants convened in to help ensure a successful transition away from usd libor identified sofr as its preferred alternative rate sofr is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities and is based on directly observable us treasurybacked repurchase transactions the composition and characteristics of sofr are not the same as those of libor and sofr is fundamentally different from libor for two key reasons sofr is a secured rate while libor is an unsecured rate and sofr is an overnight rate while libor is a forwardlooking rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities as a result there can be no assurance that sofr however calculated will perform the same way as libor would have at any time including as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market market volatility or global or regional economic financial political regulatory judicial or other events on march president biden signed the adjustable interest rate libor act the libor act into law the libor act offers a federal solution for transitioning legacy instruments that lack sufficient provisions addressing libors cessation by outlining a uniform process to govern the transition from libor to a replacement rate the libor act also establishes a safe harbor for lenders shielding lenders from litigation as a result of their choice of a replacement rate such as sofr per federal reserve board recommendations the federal reserve board is required to promulgate regulations carrying out the terms of the libor act not later than days following its enactment the bancorps libor transition plan is organized around key work streams including continued engagement with central banks and industry working groups and regulators active client engagement comprehensive review of legacy documentation internal operational and technological readiness and risk management among other things to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates although the full impact of libor reforms and actions remains unclear the bancorp has discontinued entering into new liborbased contracts in accordance with regulatory guidance except for permissible limited use as part of hedging and risk management programs during the fourth quarter of the bancorp expanded its offering of alternative reference rate products including sofr in addition the bancorp is continuing its transition of existing liborbased exposures to an appropriate alternative reference rate on or before june as of march the bancorp had substantial exposure to liborbased products throughout several of its lines of business these exposures included derivative contracts with a total notional value of approximately billion loans outstanding of approximately billion preferred stock of approximately billion and longterm debt of approximately million the bancorp currently estimates that approximately of the existing exposures will mature before june for the contracts that will not mature prior to june an additional portion of these contracts is subject to contractual terms specifying alternative reference rates fallback provisions that would become effective upon cessation of libors publication existing exposures without fallback provisions are expected to be amended prior to june to include such terms or transition to an alternative reference rate for a further discussion of the various risks the bancorp faces in

financial condition and results of operations continued business segment review the bancorp reports on four business segments commercial banking branch banking consumer lending and wealth and asset management additional information on each business segment is included in note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements results of the bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices the structure and accounting practices are specific to the bancorp therefore the financial results of the bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions the bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as managements accounting practices and businesses change the bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level by employing an ftp methodology the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits the ftp methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities respectively based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction assigning the ftp rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates the bancorps ftp methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the assetgenerating and depositproviding businesses on a durationadjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance as the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched the residual impact of the ftp methodology is captured in general corporate and other the charge and credit rates are determined using the ftp rate curve which is based on an estimate of fifth thirds marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets the ftp curve is constructed using the us swap curve brokered cd pricing and unsecured debt pricing the bancorp adjusts the ftp charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminatelived deposits key assumptions including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts are reviewed annually credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions in general the charge rates on assets decreased throughout but have increased since december as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio the credit rates for deposit products also increased since december due to higher interest rates and modified assumptions thus net interest income for assetgenerating business segments was negatively impacted by the rates charged on assets while depositproviding business segments were positively impacted during the three months ended march the bancorps methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net chargeoffs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in alll factors is captured in general corporate and other the financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses additionally the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of relationship depth opportunities and funding operations by accessing
