item risk factors the risks and uncertainties listed below present risks that could have a material impact on the bancorps financial condition the results of its operations or its business some of these risks and uncertainties are interrelated and the occurrence of one or more of them may exacerbate the effect of others the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones fifth third faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to fifth third or that fifth third currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business see cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements elsewhere in this annual report on s andor financial statements as applicable andor determinations of material weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures in addition responding to informationgathering requests reviews investigations and proceedings regardless of the ultimate outcome of the matter could be timeconsuming and expensive like other large financial institutions and companies fifth third is also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct including noncompliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or other enforcement action against fifth third could materially adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations andor cause significant reputational harm to its business the outcome of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate although fifth third establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated fifth third does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to fifth third from the legal proceedings in question thus fifth thirds ultimate losses may be higher and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies which could adversely affect fifth thirds results of operations in addition there has been a trend of public settlements with governmental agencies that may adversely affect other financial institutions to the extent such settlements are used as a template for future settlements the uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and actual settlements or penalties for further information on specific legal and regulatory proceedings refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements fifth third may be required to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse investors and others as a result of breaches in contractual representations and warranties fifth third sells residential mortgage loans to various parties including governmentsponsored enterprises gse and other financial institutions that purchase residential mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization fifth third may be required to repurchase residential mortgage loans indemnify the securitization trust investor or insurer or reimburse the securitization trust investor or insurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach of contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied within a specified period usually days or less after fifth third receives notice of the breach contracts for residential mortgage loan sales to the gses include various types of specific remedies and penalties that could be applied to inadequate responses to repurchase requests as a result fifth third has established reserves in its consolidated financial statements for probable losses related to the residential mortgage loans it has sold if economic conditions or the housing market deteriorate or future investor repurchase demand and fifth thirds success at appealing such repurchase requests differ from expectations fifth third could have increased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on repurchases requiring material additions to the repurchase reserve due to uncertainties relating to these factors there can be no assurance that the reserves fifth third establishes will be adequate or that the total amount of losses incurred will not have a material adverse effect on fifth thirds financial condition or results of operations fifth third bancorp fifth third is subject to extensive governmental regulation which could adversely impact fifth third or the businesses in which fifth third is engaged government regulation and legislation subject fifth third and other financial institutions to restrictions oversight andor costs that may have an impact on fifth thirds business financial condition results of operations or the price of its common stock fifth third is subject to extensive federal and state regulation supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations and limit the businesses in which fifth third may engage these laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers borrowers and depositors and are not designed to protect securityholders in the past decade the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which fifth third is subject increased in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes compliance with these laws and regulations has resulted in and will continue to result in additional costs which could be significant and may have a material and adverse effect on fifth thirds results of operations in addition if fifth third does not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations especially those that apply to its consumer operations which has been an area of heightened focus fifth third may be subject to fines penalties or judgments or material regulatory restrictions on its businesses which could adversely affect operations and in turn financial results additionally actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against fifth third could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defending itself and may lead to penalties that materially affect fifth third and its shareholders future changes in laws or regulations including tax laws and regulations such as the inflation reduction act or their interpretations or enforcement may also be materially adverse to fifth third and its shareholders or may require fifth third to expend significant time and resources to comply with such requirements in addition as climate change issues become more prevalent the us and foreign governments are beginning to respond to these issues the increasing government focus on climate change may result in new environmental regulations including disclosure required by the sec that could result in additional compliance costs similarly the impact of domestic and international events related to financial crime such as fraud money laundering and economic sanctions will continue to be an area of constant change risk and regulatory focus which pose ongoing regulatory compliance operational and financial risks the biden administration has sought to implement a regulatory agenda that has included or could include a heightened focus on the risks arising from climate change fair lending consumer protection bank secrecy act and antimoney laundering requirements topics related to social equity executive compensation and increased capital and liquidity as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends in addition mergers and acquisitions may be hindered by increased antitrust and other regulatory scrutiny reform proposals are also expected for the shortterm wholesale markets it is uncertain if the implementation of any of these policies would impact fifth third and if so what the impact would be fifth third cannot predict whether any pending or future legislation will be adopted or the substance and impact of any such new legislation on fifth third changes in regulation and supervisory and enforcement focus could affect fifth third in a substantial way and could have an adverse effect on its business financial condition and results of operations additionally legislation or regulatory reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that fifth third deals within the course of business such as rating agencies insurance companies and investors in addition changes in laws or regulations that affect fifth thirds customers and business partners could negatively affect fifth thirds revenues and expenses certain changes in laws such as tax law reforms that impose limitations on the deductibility of interest may decrease the demand for fifth thirds products or services and could negatively affect its revenues and results of operations other changes in laws or regulations could cause fifth thirds thirdparty service providers and other vendors to increase the prices they charge to fifth third and negatively affect fifth thirds expenses and financial results fifth third could suffer from unauthorized use of intellectual property fifth third develops for itself and licenses from others intellectual property for use in conducting its business this intellectual property has been and may be subject to misappropriation or infringement by third parties as well as claims that fifth thirds use of certain technology or other intellectual property infringes on rights owned by others fifth third has been and may be subject to disputes andor litigation concerning these claims and could be held responsible for significant damages covering past activities and substantial fees to continue to engage in these activities in the future fifth third may also be unable to acquire rights to use certain intellectual property that is important for its business and may be unable to effectively engage in critical business activities if fifth third is unable to protect or acquire rights to use intellectual property it owns or licenses it may lose certain competitive advantages incur expenses andor lose revenue and may suffer harm to its business results and financial condition fifth third is subject to various regulatory requirements that may limit its operations and potential growth under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions and their holding companies the frb the fdic the cfpb and the occ have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions by the bancorp and the bank the bancorp and the bank are subject to such supervisory authority and more generally must in certain instances obtain prior regulatory approval before engaging in certain activities or corporate decisions there can be no assurance that such approvals if required would be forthcoming or that such approvals would be granted in a timely manner failure to receive any such approval if required could limit or impair the bancorps operations restrict its growth ability to compete innovate or participate in industry consolidation andor affect its dividend policy such actions and activities that may be subject to prior approval include but are not limited to increasing dividends or other fifth third bancorp capital distributions by the bancorp or the bank entering into a merger or acquisition transaction acquiring or establishing new branches and entering into certain new businesses failure by the bancorp or the bank to meet the applicable eligibility requirements for fhc status including capital and management requirements and that the bank maintain at least a satisfactory cra rating may result in restrictions on certain activities of the bancorp including the commencement of new activities and mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions and could ultimately result in the loss of fhc status fifth third and other financial institutions are highly regulated and subject to extensive oversight supervision and examination by regulators including the frb occ fdic cfpb sec cftc finra the national futures association and other state federal and selfregulatory entities fifth third is also subject to certain regulatory requirements as a result of its banking activity including with respect to stress testing liquidity and capital levels asset quality provisioning amlbsa fair lending consumer compliance and other prudential matters and efforts to ensure that financial institutions take steps to improve their risk management and prevent future crises for more information refer to regulation and supervisionregulatory regime for derivatives in item of this annual report on form 10k in this regard government authorities including the bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement are also pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect fifth thirds ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith the government enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties fines or restitution to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institutionaffiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices in some cases regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not be publicly disclosed which restrict or limit a financial institution finally as part of fifth thirds regular examination process the bancorp and the banks respective regulators may advise it and its banking subsidiary to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter such supervisory actions or restrictions if and in whatever manner imposed could negatively affect fifth thirds ability to engage in new activities and certain transactions as well as have a material adverse effect on fifth thirds business and results of operations and may not be publicly disclosed fifth third could face serious negative consequences if its thirdparty service providers business partners or investments fail to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations fifth third is expected to oversee the legal and regulatory compliance of its business endeavors including those performed by thirdparty service providers business partners other vendors and certain companies in which fifth third has invested legal authorities and regulators could hold fifth third responsible for failures by these parties to comply with applicable laws rules or regulations these failures could expose fifth third to significant litigation or regulatory action that could limit its activities or impose significant fines or other financial losses additionally fifth third could be subject to significant litigation from consumers or other parties harmed by these failures and could suffer significant losses of business and revenue as well as reputational harm as a result of these failures as a regulated entity the bancorp is subject to certain capital requirements that may limit its operations potential growth and ability to pay or increase dividends on its common stock or to repurchase its capital stock as a bhc and an fhc the bancorp is subject to the comprehensive consolidated supervision and regulation of the frb including riskbased and leverage capital requirements investment practices dividend policy and growth the bancorp must maintain certain riskbased and leverage capital ratios as required by the frb which can change depending upon general economic conditions and the bancorps particular condition risk profile and growth plans compliance with the capital requirements including leverage ratios may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect the bancorps ability to expand or maintain present business levels failure by the bank to meet applicable capital requirements could subject it to a variety of enforcement actions available to the federal regulatory authorities these include limitations on the ability of the bancorp to pay dividends andor repurchase shares the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital loss of fhc status and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic the bancorp is subject to the stress capital buffer requirement and must maintain capital ratios above its buffered minimum regulatory minimum plus stress capital buffer in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers the frb uses the supervisory stress test to determine the bancorps stress capital buffer subject to a floor of the bancorps stress capital buffer requirement has been since the introduction of this framework and was most recently affirmed as part of fifth thirds capital plan submission with an effective date of october further changes to applicable capital and liquidity requirements could result in unexpected or new limitations on the bancorps ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchases fifth third bancorp deposit insurance premiums levied against the bank could increase further if the number of bank failures increase or the cost of resolving failed banks increases the fdic maintains a deposit insurance fund dif to protect insured depositors in the event of bank failures the dif is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions including the bank future deposit premiums paid by the bank depend on fdic rules which are subject to change the level of the dif and the magnitude and cost of future bank failures as of june the dif reserve ratio fell to below the statutory minimum of in order to restore the dif to its statutorily mandated minimums the fdic significantly increased deposit insurance premium rates including the banks resulting in increased expenses the revised assessment rate schedules became effective january and are applicable to the first quarterly assessment period of additionally on november the fdic finalized a special assessment to recover the loss to the dif caused by the bank failures that occurred in to be collected at an annual rate of approximately basis points for an anticipated total of eight quarterly assessment periods beginning the first quarterly assessment period of the fdic may further increase the assessment rates or impose additional special assessments in the future which may require the bank to pay significantly higher fdic premiums if an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bhc or nonbank financial company were triggered fifth third could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund doddfrank created authority for the orderly liquidation of systemically important bhcs and nonbank financial companies and is based on the fdics bank resolution model the secretary of the us treasury may trigger liquidation under this authority only after consultation with the president of the united states and after receiving a recommendation from the board of the fdic and the frb upon a twothirds vote liquidation proceedings will be funded by the orderly liquidation fund established under doddfrank which will borrow from the us treasury and impose riskbased assessments on covered financial companies riskbased assessments would be made first on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess and second if necessary on among others bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more such as fifth third any such assessments may adversely affect fifth thirds business financial condition or results of operations market risks interest rate risks and price risks weakness in the us economy including within fifth thirds geographic footprint has adversely affected fifth third in the past and may adversely affect fifth third in the future fifth third has been and will continue to be impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states these conditions include shortterm and longterm interest rates inflation money supply political issues legislative and regulatory changes fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets broad trends in industry and finance unemployment and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which fifth third operates all of which are beyond fifth thirds control deterioration or continued weakness in any of these conditions could result in a decrease in demand for fifth thirds products and services worldwide financial markets have recently experienced periods of extraordinary disruption and volatility which have been driven by factors such as the covid19 pandemic the russiaukraine conflict and the evolving conflict in israel and gaza resulting in heightened credit risk reduced valuation of investments decreased economic activity heightened risk of cyberattacks and inflation moreover many companies have experienced reduced liquidity and uncertainty as to their ability to raise capital during such periods of market disruption and volatility in the event that these conditions recur or result in a prolonged economic downturn fifth thirds results of operations financial position andor liquidity could be materially and adversely affected these market conditions may affect the bancorps ability to access debt and equity capital markets in addition as a result of recent financial and political events fifth third may face increased regulation many of the other risk factors discussed in this risk factors section identify risks that result from or are impacted by a financial economic downturn these include risks related to fifth thirds investments portfolio the competitive environment and regulatory developments global and domestic political social and economic uncertainties and changes may adversely affect fifth third global financial markets including the united states face political and economic uncertainties such as recent budget deficit concerns and political conflict over legislation to raise the us governments debt limit that may delay investment and hamper economic activity international events such as trade disputes separatist movements leadership changes and political and military conflicts such as the ongoing military tension between russia and ukraine and the evolving conflict in israel and gaza could adversely affect global financial activity and markets and could negatively affect the us economy the united states is also facing a potentially contentious presidential election as well as elections to determine the control of congress and state governments additionally the frb and other major central banks have removed or reduced monetary accommodation and raised interest rates increasing the risk of recession and may also negatively impact asset values and credit spreads that were impacted by extraordinary monetary stimulus these potential negative effects on financial markets and economic activity could lead to reduced revenues increased costs increased credit risks and volatile markets could adversely impact fifth thirds ability to raise liquidity via money and capital markets and could negatively impact fifth thirds businesses results of operations and financial condition changes in interest rates could affect fifth thirds income and cash flows fifth thirds income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interestearning assets such as loans and investment securities and the interest rates paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond fifth thirds control including general economic conditions in the us or abroad and the fifth third bancorp policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates and inflation could influence the origination of loans the prepayment speed of loans the purchase of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding as well as customers ability to repay loans for example a tightening of the money supply by the frb could reduce the demand for a borrowers products and services this could adversely affect the borrowers earnings and ability to repay a loan which could have a material adverse effect on fifth thirds financial condition and results of operations the impact of these changes may be magnified if fifth third does not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of its assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates fluctuations in these areas may adversely affect fifth third its customers and its shareholders throughout and the federal reserve raised the federal funds rate to its current targeted rate between and in an effort to curb inflation as inflation increases and market interest rates rise the value of fifth thirds investment securities particularly those that have fixed rates or longer maturities could decrease increasing rates would also increase debt service requirements for some of fifth thirds borrowers and may adversely affect those borrowers ability to pay as contractually obligated and could result in additional delinquencies or chargeoffs further the increase in market interest rates is likely to reduce fifth thirds loan origination volume particularly refinance volume andor reduce its interest rate spread which could have an adverse effect on fifth thirds profitability and results of operations fifth third cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects that they may have on fifth thirds activities and financial results changes and trends in the capital markets may affect fifth thirds income and cash flows fifth third enters into and maintains trading and investment positions in the capital markets on its own behalf and manages investment positions on behalf of its customers these investment positions include derivative financial instruments the revenues and profits fifth third derives from managing proprietary and customer trading and investment positions are dependent on market prices market changes and trends may result in a decline in wealth and asset management revenue or investment or trading losses that may impact fifth third losses on behalf of its customers could expose fifth third to reputational issues litigation credit risks or loss of revenue from those clients and customers additionally losses in fifth thirds trading and investment positions could lead to a loss with respect to those investments and may adversely affect fifth thirds income cash flows and funding costs fifth thirds stock price is volatile fifth thirds stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future these factors include without limitation actual or anticipated variations in earnings changes in analysts recommendations or projections fifth thirds announcements of developments related to its businesses operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers actions by government regulators and changes in the regulatory regime new technology used or services offered by traditional and nontraditional competitors news reports of trends concerns and other issues related to the financial services industry us and global economic conditions natural disasters geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism military conflicts and withdrawal from the eu by eu member countries the price for shares of fifth thirds common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future and these fluctuations may be unrelated to fifth thirds performance general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price for shares of fifth thirds common stock and the current market price of such shares may not be indicative of future market prices fifth thirds mortgage banking net revenue can be volatile from quarter to quarter fifth third earns revenue from the fees it receives for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans when rates rise the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall reducing the revenue fifth third receives from loan originations at the same time revenue from mortgage servicing rights msr can increase through increases in fair value when rates fall mortgage originations tend to increase and the value of msrs tends to decline also with some offsetting revenue effect even though the origination of mortgage loans can act as a natural hedge the hedge is not perfect either in amount or timing for example the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of residential msrs is immediate but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the msrs relating to the new loans would accrue over time it is also possible that even if interest rates were to fall mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the msrs value caused by the lower rates fifth third typically uses derivatives and other instruments to hedge its mortgage banking interest rate and price risks fifth third generally does not hedge all of its risks and the fact that fifth third attempts to hedge any of the risks does not mean fifth third will be successful hedging is a complex process requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring fifth third may use hedging instruments tied to us treasury rates sofr or other benchmarks that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged fifth third could incur significant losses from its hedging activities there may be periods where fifth third elects not to use derivatives and other instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate and price risks fifth third bancorp strategic risks if fifth third does not respond to intense competition and rapid changes in the financial services industry or otherwise adapt to changing customer preferences its financial performance may suffer fifth thirds ability to deliver strong financial performance and returns on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the needs and demands of its customers in addition to the challenge of competing against other banks in attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services fifth thirds competitors also include securities dealers brokers mortgage bankers investment advisors and specialty finance telecommunications technology and insurance companies as well as large retailers who seek to offer onestop financial services in addition to other products and services desired by consumers that may include services that banks have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past or may not be currently able or allowed to offer many of these other firms may be significantly larger than fifth third and may have access to customers and financial resources that are beyond fifth thirds capability fifth third competes with these firms with respect to capital access to capital revenue generation products services transaction execution innovation reputation talent and price this increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in customer preferences regulation changes in technology and product delivery systems as well as the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers rapidly changing technology and consumer preferences may require fifth third to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services in order to compete and meet customer demands fifth third may not be able to do so or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers as a result fifth thirds ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired and its business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected fifth third may make strategic investments and may expand an existing line of business or enter into new lines of business to remain competitive if fifth thirds chosen strategies are not appropriate to allow fifth third to effectively compete or fifth third does not execute them in an appropriate or timely manner fifth thirds business and results may suffer additionally these strategies products and lines of business may bring with them unforeseeable or unforeseen risks and may not generate the expected results or returns which could adversely affect fifth thirds results of operations or future growth prospects and cause fifth third to fail to meet its stated goals and expectations industry adoption of realtime payments networks could negatively impact financial performance through reductions in product profitability increased liquidity reserves and the potential for increased fraud losses among other risks with the launch of realtime payments networks such as rtp from the clearing house and fednow from the federal reserve instantaneous cash settlement capabilities are available hours a day and days a week the implications of the new settlement capabilities are far reaching and have not yet significantly affected the banking industry as market adoption increases fifth third may be required to hold more liquidity reserves in cash to facilitate cash settlement activity outside of traditional business hours additionally instantaneous settlement will likely reduce float benefits associated with providing deposit and banking services as well as pose incremental fraud risk due to a reduced ability to reverse fraudulent transactions due to the speed of money movement changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact fifth thirds investments in its bank premises and equipment and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change its retail distribution channel fifth third has significant investments in bank premises and equipment for its branch network including its fullservice banking centers parcels of land held for the development of future banking centers and properties that are developed or in the process of being developed as branches as well as its retail work force and other branch banking assets advances in technology such as ecommerce telephone internet and mobile banking and inbranch selfservice technologies including automatic teller machines and other equipment as well as changing work arrangements and customer preferences for these other methods of accessing fifth thirds products and services could affect the value of fifth thirds branch network or other retail distribution assets and may cause it to change its retail distribution strategy close andor sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce its remaining branches and work force further advances in technology andor changes in customer preferences could have additional changes in fifth thirds retail distribution strategy andor branch network these actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of other longlived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate and reconfigure remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution channel difficulties in identifying suitable opportunities or combining the operations of acquired entities or assets with fifth thirds own operations or assessing the effectiveness of businesses in which fifth third makes strategic investments or with which fifth third enters into strategic contractual relationships may prevent fifth third from achieving the expected benefits from these acquisitions investments or relationships inherent uncertainties exist when assessing acquiring or integrating the operations of another business or investment or relationship opportunity fifth third may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies relevant to an acquisition or strategic relationship in addition the markets and industries in which fifth third and its potential acquisition and investment targets operate are highly competitive acquisition or investment targets may lose customers or otherwise perform poorly or unprofitably or in the case of an acquired business or strategic relationship cause fifth third to lose customers or perform poorly or unprofitably future acquisition and investment activities and efforts to monitor newly acquired businesses or reap the benefits of a new strategic relationship may fifth third bancorp require fifth third to devote substantial time and resources and may cause these acquisitions investments and relationships to be unprofitable or cause fifth third to be unable to pursue other business opportunities after completing an acquisition fifth third may find that certain material information was not adequately disclosed during the due diligence process or that certain items were not accounted for properly in accordance with financial accounting and reporting standards fifth third may also not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity or assets for example fifth third could experience higher chargeoffs than originally anticipated related to the acquired loan portfolio additionally acquired companies or businesses may increase fifth thirds risk of regulatory action or restrictions related to the operations of the acquired business future acquisitions may dilute current shareholders ownership of fifth third and may cause fifth third to become more susceptible to adverse economic events future business acquisitions could be material to fifth third and it may issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions which would dilute current shareholders ownership interests acquisitions also could require fifth third to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt in those events fifth third could become more susceptible to economic downturns dislocations in capital markets and competitive pressures fifth third may sell or consider selling one or more of its businesses or investments should it determine to sell such a business or investment it may not be able to generate gains on sale or related increases in shareholders equity commensurate with desirable levels moreover if fifth third sold such businesses or investments the loss of income could have an adverse effect on its earnings and future growth fifth third owns or owns a minority stake in as applicable several nonstrategic businesses investments and other assets that are not significantly synergistic with its core financial services businesses or in the future may no longer be aligned with fifth thirds strategic plans or regulatory expectations if fifth third were to sell one or more of its businesses or investments it would be subject to market forces that may affect the timing or pricing of such sale or result in an unsuccessful sale if fifth third were to complete the sale of any of its businesses investments andor interests in third parties it would lose the income from the sold businesses andor interests including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting and such loss of income could have an adverse effect on its future earnings and growth additionally fifth third may encounter difficulties in separating the operations of any businesses it sells which may affect its business or results of operations fifth third has businesses other than banking that are subject to a variety of risks fifth third is a diversified financial services company as a result the bancorp is subject to additional risks and uncertainties other businesses that the bancorp operates include investment banking securities underwriting and market making investment management and retail and institutional brokerage services offered through the bancorps subsidiaries these business activities are subject to rigorous regulatory oversight by federal state and selfregulatory entities and may incur substantial market operational credit regulatory legal and other risks that could adversely impact the bancorps results of operations for more information refer to regulation and supervisionregulatory regime for derivatives in item of this annual report on form 10k reputation risks damage to fifth thirds reputation could harm its business fifth thirds actual or alleged conduct in activities such as certain sales and lending practices data security operational resiliency corporate governance and acquisitions inappropriate behavior or misconduct of employees failure to deliver minimum or required standards of service or quality association with particular customers business partners investments or vendors as well as developments from any of the other risks described above may result in negative public opinion at large or with certain segments of the public and may damage fifth thirds reputation because fifth third conducts most of its businesses under the fifth third brand negative public opinion about one business could affect its other businesses actions taken by government regulators shareholder activists and community organizations may also damage fifth thirds reputation additionally whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media the advent and expansion of social media facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation though fifth third monitors social media channels the potential remains for rapid and widespread dissemination of inaccurate misleading or false information or other negative information that could damage fifth thirds reputation negative public opinion can adversely affect fifth thirds ability to attract and keep customers and can increase the risk that it will be a target of litigation and regulatory action fifth third is subject to environmental social and governance esg risks that could adversely affect its reputation the trading price of its common stock andor its business operations and earnings certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies based upon esg metrics currently there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings but esg evaluations are becoming more important to the reputation and success of many businesses including financial institutions views about esgrelated issues are diverse dynamic and rapidly changing and if fifth third were to fail to maintain appropriate esg practices and disclosures or be subject to certain esg scores or ratings fifth third could face potential negative esgrelated publicity in traditional and social media including based on the identity of those fifth third chooses to do business with and the publics view of those customers if fifth third bancorp fifth third or its relationships with customers vendors and suppliers were to become the subject of such negative publicity fifth thirds ability to attract and retain customers and employees may be negatively impacted and its stock price may also be impacted companies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers regulators investors and other stakeholders related to their esg practices and disclosures for fifth third and others in the financial services industry this focus extends to the practices and disclosures of the customers counterparties and service providers with whom fifth third chooses to do business investor advocacy groups investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices especially as they relate to the environment health and safety diversity labor conditions and human rights and certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks and opportunities of climate change and the adequacy of companies responses to climate change and other esg matters as part of their investment theses new government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of esg oversight and expand mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence and disclosure failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact fifth thirds reputation ability to do business with certain partners access to capital and its stock price while fifth third has sustainability and corporate responsibility initiatives there can be no assurance that regulators customers investors and employees will determine that these programs are sufficiently robust in addition there can be no assurance that fifth third will be able to attain its announced goals related to its sustainability and corporate responsibility programs as statements regarding its goals reflect fifth thirds current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that it will be able to achieve them within the timelines it announces or at all actual or perceived shortcomings with respect to these esg initiatives and reporting can impact fifth thirds ability to hire and retain employees increase its customer base or attract and retain certain types of investors in addition certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies based upon esg metrics collecting measuring and reporting esg information and metrics can be costly difficult and time consuming is subject to evolving reporting standards and can present numerous operational reputational financial legal and other risks any of which could have a material impact including on fifth thirds reputation and stock price inadequate processes to collect and review this information prior to disclosure could be subject to potential liability related to such information activists are increasingly targeting financial firms with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain industries such as those which are carbon intensive including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to health the environment the global climate or the social good activist criticism of fifth thirds relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among stakeholders with how fifth third addresses environmental or social concerns through business activities which could negatively affect its business or reputation conversely states throughout the banks footprint have taken actions or proposed measures to limit the states ability to do business with financial institutions or other businesses identified as discriminating against certain industries such as those which are carbon intensive or practices based on environmental or social criteria additionally other activist groups have begun to target firms with public criticism for engaging in esg practices or adhering to certain esg principles although fifth third has a defined risk management approach for client selection fifth third could be inherently exposed to reputational financial and legal risk and its ability to retain and attract customers and employees may be negatively impacted as a result of these contrasting arguments in how a financial institution should address these issues general business risks changes in accounting standards or interpretations could impact fifth thirds reported earnings and financial condition the accounting standard setters including the fasb the sec and other regulatory agencies periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of fifth thirds consolidated financial statements these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how fifth third records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases fifth third could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively which would result in the recasting of fifth thirds prior period financial statements fifth third uses models for business planning purposes that may not adequately predict future results fifth third uses financial models to aid in its planning for various purposes including its capital and liquidity needs and other purposes the models used may not accurately account for all variables may fail to predict outcomes accurately andor may overstate or understate certain effects as a result of these potential
