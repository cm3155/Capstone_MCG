and thank all of you for joining us today our strong quarterly financial results reflect focused execution throughout the bank the reported earnings included a negative impact from the two items noted in the release we generated solid revenue growth which resulted in record fee income combined with another quarter of strong credit quality as a result we produced an adjusted rotce excluding aoci of over improvements in credit quality resulted in million release to our credit reserves and an acl ratio of basis points compared to basis points last quarter combined with another quarter of historically low net charge offs we had a million net benefit to the provision for credit losses moving to the income statement net interest income of approximately billion increased sequentially reflecting ci loan growth million in seasonal mutual fund dividends and million in prepayment penalties received in the investment portfolio as well as a reduction in longterm debt these items were partially offset by lower loan yields and a decline in ppprelated income which was million this quarter compared to million in the prior quarter excluding ppp nii increased million or sequentially on the funding side we reduced our total interestbearing liabilities cost basis points this quarter compared to the prior quarter reported net interest margin decreased basis points reflecting a billion increase in interestbearing cash and lower loan yields partially offset by prepayment penalties and mutual fund dividends from our investment portfolio excluding the impact of excess cash nim was flat sequentially total reported noninterest income increased compared to the year ago quarter as we discussed in early december reported results included negative valuation marks totaling million attributable to a million negative msr valuation as well as a million fintech investment unrealized loss recorded in securities losses that occurred since its october ipo similar to our previous holdings of public companies we will exit our position at the appropriate time adjusted noninterest income results excluded the impact of security gains and losses the visa swap as well as prior period business disposition gains and losses adjusted noninterest income increased sequentially driven by another quarter of record commercial banking revenue we generated record ma advisory fees notably in our healthcare vertical reflecting successful outcomes from our coker and h2c teams combined with strong business lending and syndication revenue these items were partially offset by lower corporate bond fees fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 we also generated solid fee revenue growth in treasury management card and processing and wealth and asset management where we generated record net aum inflows in both the fourth quarter and the full year we were recently recognized as one of the worlds best private banks for the third consecutive year by global finance magazine and our results reflect it additionally mortgage banking revenue decreased million compared to the third quarter which included a million unfavorable impact from our decision to retain million of retail production during the quarter compared to the year ago quarter adjusted noninterest income increased with improvement in every single fee caption reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year noninterest income represented of total revenue in the fourth quarter reported noninterest expenses decreased compared to the year ago quarter primarily driven by lower occupancy expense as well as lower processing expense reflecting contract renegotiations adjusted expenses increased driven by higher performancebased compensation reflecting strong business results from record aum inflows and commercial loan production elevated medical benefits due to the pandemic loan servicing expenses and continued technology investments our expenses this quarter included marktomarket impacts associated with nonqualified deferred compensation of million compared to less than million last quarter for the full year total adjusted fees increased compared to just expense growth commercial banking revenue increased card and processing revenue increased wealth and asset management revenue increased and tm revenue increased offset by a million reduction from lower tra income and a decline in mortgage banking on the expense side the largest contributor of the growth was elevated performancebased compensation technology investments and loan servicing expenses these items were partially offset by the actions we took about a year ago to streamline the organization including process reengineering vendor renegotiations and divestitures of noncore businesses such as property and casualty insurance hsa deposits and 401k recordkeeping moving to the balance sheet total average portfolio loans and leases increased sequentially including the ppp headwind excluding ppp portfolio loans and leases increased on an average basis and increased on a periodend basis average total consumer portfolio loans increased compared to the prior quarter as continued strength in auto was partially offset by declines in home equity and other consumer loan balances average commercial portfolio loans and leases increased compared to the prior quarter reflecting growth in ci loans excluding ppp average commercial loans increased with ci loans up as greg mentioned commercial loan production was robust across the board up nearly compared to the prior quarter reflecting strong corporate and middle market banking production which was well diversified geographically as a result periodend ci loans excluding ppp increased sequentially revolver utilization of increased compared to the prior quarter average cre loans were down sequentially with lower balances in mortgage and construction driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 by the pandemic as we have discussed before we continue to have the lowest cre concentration as a percentage of total capital compared to peers given the rate environment towards the end of the fourth quarter we began investing a small portion of our excess cash with the average securities portfolio balances increasing sequentially average other shortterm investments which includes our interestbearing cash remained elevated reflecting continued growth in core deposits compared to the prior quarter commercial transaction deposits increased and consumer transaction deposits increased moving to credit as greg mentioned our credit performance this quarter was once again strong with fourth quarter net chargeoffs remaining historically low nonperforming assets declined sequentially with the npa ratio declining basis points criticized assets declined sequentially reflecting a significant improvement from covid highimpact industries additionally criticized assets declined in virtually every region and vertical and also improved in our leveraged loan portfolio from a product standpoint we continue to closely monitor cre including office and hospitality exposures given the ongoing effects of the pandemic moving to the acl our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains stable with unemployment ending our threeyear reasonable and supportable period at around we did not change our scenario weights of to the base and to the upside and downside scenarios given the continued uncertainty during the pandemic our acl release this quarter came primarily from commercial reflecting the improved risk profile of the portfolio if the acl were based on the downside scenario the acl would be million higher if the acl were weighted to the baseline scenario the reserve would be million lower while the economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to continued strength in the economy there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out given the uncertain environment in addition to covid we continue to monitor the economic and lending implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist our december allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment moving to capital our capital levels remained strong with the cet1 ratio ending the quarter at during the quarter we completed million in share repurchases as part of our capital plan which reduced our share count by million shares now that we have reached our cet1 goal we are returning to our cet1 target of based on our improved credit risk profile and the economic outlook it is worth noting that combining regulatory capital credit reserves and unrealized gains we have one of the highest overall loss absorbency rates among peers as greg mentioned last night we announced the strategic acquisition of dividend finance strategically dividend furthers our existing indirect consumer pointofsale capabilities with a techforward platform dividend pioneered the financing model which improves economic outcomes for customers and contractors this helped accelerate dividends growth in the solar industry which is expected to continue growing at a doubledigit cagr over the next several years dividend will improve fifth thirds loan portfolio granularity geographic diversification and balance between consumer and commercial loans furthermore while not modeled we expect to generate synergies over time in our mortgage and home equity business as well as with our existing commercial clients fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 the transaction is also financially compelling in dividend gained market share and originated over billion in loans which increased compared to we expect total origination volume of around billion in post close dividend finance previously utilized an originatetosell model and as a result the closing of the acquisition will not include a material transfer of loan balances however post close fifth third will retain all loan originations given the scalability of the business we expect a life of loan roa of 3plus rotce of 30plus and an efficiency ratio below our modeling conservatively assumes a market share consistent with dividend finances recent history no extension of the federal solar investment tax credit and annualized net chargeoffs around basis points the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter and will utilize approximately basis points of capital our long term capital priorities remain unchanged first deploy capital into organic growth initiatives then evaluate strategic nonbank opportunities continue paying a strong dividend and finally execute share repurchases with excess capital given the strong loan growth and the acquisition of dividend finance we currently expect to resume share repurchases sometime in the second half of the year moving to our current outlook our full year guidance includes the financial impacts from dividend finance which is expected to close in the second quarter we expect full year average total loan growth between and compared to including the expected headwinds from ppp and the ginnie mae forbearance loans we added throughout last year excluding these items we expect total average loan growth between and reflecting robust pipelines sales force additions the dividend and provide acquisitions and only a improvement in commercial revolver utilization rates over the course of the year this should result in commercial loan growth of to excluding ppp additionally we expect total average consumer loan growth between and excluding the ginnie mae loans on a sequential basis we expect first quarter average total loan growth of to excluding ppp and ginnie mae loans including those impacts we expect average total loans to increase to compared to the fourth quarter our outlook reflects continued strength in commercial given our production and pipelines we expect average ci growth in the first quarter excluding ppp we expect cre balances to be stable sequentially in the first quarter and as a result expect average total commercial loan growth of to sequentially excluding ppp we expect average consumer loan balances to increase around sequentially excluding the ginnie mae impacts we provide our expectations for this portfolio in our presentation appendix given our loan outlook we expect full year nii to increase to it is worth noting that our outlook incorporates the impacts from the ppp and ginnie mae portfolios which will result in a million headwind next year or about percentage points meaning we would have expected close to doubledigit growth in nii if not for those portfolios which have served their purpose to help bridge us to the more productive rate environment given that current rate environment our forecast assumes growth in our securities portfolio of approximately billion per quarter and includes three rate hikes beginning in may due to the evolving economic outlook our forecast and balance sheet management strategies are subject to change as a reference point we estimate that fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 a 25basis point incremental rate hike would increase nii by approximately million to million per quarter or basis points of nim when fully realized the ultimate impact to nii of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing of shortterm rate movements balance sheet management strategies including securities growth and hedging transactions and realized deposit betas on the topic of deposit betas our current outlook assumes a deposit beta around over the first basis points of rate hikes including less than for the first couple of hikes we have updated our nii sensitivity disclosures in the presentation appendix which now incorporates a dynamic beta repricing assumption rather than static beta approach previously utilized the information in the appendix uses modeled approaches to estimate the impacts of various rate scenarios based on decades of historical data these modeled betas are for the first 100basispoint scenario and for the plus 200basispoint scenario for the first quarter we expect nii to be down sequentially impacted primarily by day count as well as lower prepayment penalty ppp and ginnie mae income partially offset by strong loan growth given the january forward curve did not consider a march rate hike if the fed were to move in march with a runup in benchmark rates we would expect first quarter nii to be stable sequentially we expect adjusted noninterest income to increase to in reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities resulting in stronger treasury management revenue capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue additionally we expect strong processing revenue reflecting both the economic environment and continued household growth mortgage revenue should improve modestly in reflecting elevated servicing revenue from msr purchases throughout and moderating asset decay partially offset by a meaningful decrease in production revenue we expect tra and private equity income to be stable compared to levels we expect first quarter adjusted noninterest income to be stable yearoveryear or decline around to compared to the fourth quarter excluding the impacts of the tra we expect fees to be down approximately sequentially reflecting seasonal factors a decline in private equity income and lower leasing revenue we expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up around excluding the impact of dividend finance compared to or up to including dividend we expect compensation expenses to increase around or so reflecting wage pressures and sales force additions partially offset by lower performancebased compensation in certain areas such as mortgage given the outlook for lower origination volumes we also continue to invest in our digital transformation which should result in technology expense growth of around consistent with the past several years we also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid single digit area our outlook also assumes we add to new branches in our highgrowth markets which will result in highsingle digit growth of our southeast branch network we expect these items to be partially offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives reduced servicing expenses associated with the ginnie mae portfolio a decline in leasing expense given the revenue outlook and continued overall expense discipline throughout the company we expect total adjusted expenses in the first quarter of to be up around to compared to the year ago quarter or up to compared to the prior quarter as is always the case for us our first quarter expenses are also impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 excluding these seasonal items we expect first quarter expenses to be down approximately compared to the fourth quarter additionally our first quarter expense outlook is impacted by a broader and larger special equity grant for eligible employees to reward the record performance in and to provide a retention incentive over the next several years in this competitive labor market as a result our full year total adjusted revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in expenses resulting in more than a 1point improvement in the efficiency ratio our outlook for positive operating leverage reflects continued success growing our feebased businesses recent acquisitions expense discipline and strong balance sheet management it also considers the known revenue headwinds from ppp and our ginnie mae portfolio we would have guided to positive operating leverage on a standalone basis even without any rate hikes we expect net chargeoffs to be in the to basis point range and we expect first quarter net chargeoffs to be in the to basis points range in summary our fourth quarter and full year results were strong we achieved positive operating leverage in in a challenging interest rate environment while maintaining discipline throughout the company we have a highly assetsensitive balance sheet which should perform very well in a rising rate environment we have over billion of excess cash and continue to grow and diversify our fee revenues all of which support our throughthe cycle outperformance we are deploying capital in order to maximize longterm profitability and are committed to generating sustainable longterm value for our shareholders with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks jamie before we start qa as a courtesy to others we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions we will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning operator please open the call up for questions fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey john timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the loan growth front clearly on the commercial side on ci very robust on the endofperiod growth ex the ppp impacts can you give us a little more detail on the drivers in terms of the businesses i know you mentioned corporate and middle market and then also did you see any impact from borrowers pulling forward demand for borrowing into the fourth quarter given the change from libor to sofr thanks gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey john this is greg ill start off im going to throw to tim he is prepared with a lot of color to your question we were expecting of course first off weve made significant investments over the last five years in our strategic markets in the southeast west coast texas on verticals and talent and so forth so we would expect to see this type of outcome as we go into last year into this year so were very pleased with the performance were very pleased with the momentum we have going into it once again i think its a byproduct of the investments we made in talent our expansion in these geographies and just the way weve approached this business over the last five years were starting to see the outcomes but tim will give you more color as far as the markets itself and where were seeing the outcomes timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah sure happy to do it so let me anchor it to the numbers so exppp as you mentioned ci loan growth was about or on a dollar basis it was about billion pointtopoint in the quarter so of that about one third of it came from an increase in utilization on existing revolvers and then a full twothirds as a growth were a byproduct either of the record production we had we had a record quarter in addition to it being a record year in both corporate banking and in the middle market or it was new clients funding up commitments that were extended in earlier quarters this year consistent with the data we have been sharing on commitment growth fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 so on the utilization front the lower end of our book tends to move in terms of utilization faster than the corporate banking side and we did see that middle market and business banking had the best pickup in utilization rates which is probably at least in part a byproduct of the manufacturing and logistics centric nature of the midwest markets but the drivers there when you talk to clients were really inventory levels there were some tax distributions or was business expansion related people investing in capex or acquisitions on the corporate banking side it was really the same vertical but the draws there were most concentrated in the mortgage servicer segment on the twothirds of the growth that came from production i think as greg mentioned theyre literally basically entirely driven by the strategic investments so on corporate banking it was industry verticals in the middle market it was really the sales force expansion in the southeast through the additions of california and texas and then it was strong performance from provide as they got into the run rate in total it really is new relationships more than it is folks pulling forward a transition to sofr so we added new relationships in commercial in so about more than our prior highmark at any one point and i think what we feel very good about is these really arent just loanonly relationships they are the driver of what you saw in the strong growth we had on both treasury management and capital markets i think if you look forward i was looking at the bottomsup pipelines earlier this week and theyre about larger than where they were at the same time last year and almost larger than the first quarter of so we feel very good about our ability to sustain the robust loan growth and the drivers there again are the strategic investments chicago is the biggest yearoveryear improver as we continue to see strength and the benefits of the synergies from the mb merger and then its markets like tennessee north florida california and texas in the regions and then on the vertical side its the stalwart verticals for us healthcare and tmt along with continued really good growth in renewables and then as we talked about in the past the mortgage warehouse segment that we launched recently i think havent been out in the market the energy is really good there i think theres a strong sense for us that between the investments weve made and the fact that weve really been able to focus on execution and collaboration having had our people back in the office for longer than most and not having the distractions of merger integration or otherwise it really has been its been nice to see the pickup john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks tim and then quickly greg just on ma i wanted to get your updated thoughts on deals i know you indicated that nonbank acquisitions would be more of a priority and if so so what additional businesses outside of what you just did on the dividend finance side what are the businesses in terms of bolt ons and then maybe a quick comment just on whole bank deals thanks gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp first off thanks for the questions our strategy hasnt changed its really as you said its the bolton opportunities nonbank transactions just like we did with dividend which we couldnt be more pleased about that acquisition how it fits into our portfolio of opportunities strategically but more those type of opportunities were going to continue to look for so pointofsale on the consumer side in addition to that were going to continue to fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 focus on wealth and asset management opportunities that might emerge obviously on the cap market side on the advisory side of the house theres other verticals that were looking for partners in that space from an ma advisory perspective so well continue to focus on those opportunities the fintech plays ma advisory that fits to some of the additional verticals wealth and asset management will be the areas of opportunity we continue to stay focused on and when you think about a bank acquisition right now especially given all the challenges and complexity of what were seeing on the regulatory front in washington with some of the movements that are underway right now and the challenge to get a large transaction done or a bank transaction for banks over billion thats out there so its on your mind as you think about timing to get a transaction done but once again at this point right now our focus is to be relevant in the strategic markets that were already banking in theres not many of these opportunities that exist right now so once again its not a primary focus of ours today and i dont see that in the near future also as we think about the rest of this year john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks greg operator and our next question comes from the line of erika najarian from ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question is for jamie jamie you have been vocal in the past in terms of guiding or giving us a sense of what kind of deposit attrition we could expect in a rising rate backdrop one of your biggest competitors mentioned that they dont expect negative deposit growth at all in fact they expect positive deposit growth through this rate cycle and im wondering especially in light of your commentary that youre deploying about billion of cash per quarter if you have changed your tune as to the duration of the excess deposits that you gathered during the pandemic james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thanks erika and welcome back to the coverage of fifth third so appreciate the question let me take it in two parts so first when it comes to the macro view and for the industry you go back over the last years i think theres only been two years where deposits didnt grow in the industry so i do believe that there can be deposit growth as the fed tightens and history proves that fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 so when it comes to fifth third the more idiosyncratic view that we have is that we would be comfortable having up to a third of our excess cash migrate away from fifth third deposit products and into more productive vehicles for those customers so with that said when we look at our deposit betas and our deposit pricing outlook for the rate hikes on the horizon were going to be very disciplined on those deposit rates and therefore if deposits leave its a very manageable outcome for us however i will tell you given our strong commercial client acquisition our strong treasury management growth and our strong household growth as we sit here today even with balanced and disciplined deposit betas we still expect deposit growth this year at fifth third and thats even with continuing to run down our cd portfolio so as much as i would be comfortable with a little bit of deposit outflow i think given all our sales success we will have deposit growth this year erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is for greg i thought it was very striking and telling that jamie said during his prepared remarks that you would have generated positive operating leverage without rates and the earnings season has really put ceos in two camps one the ceos that are spending the rate hikes and second those that are more allowing it to fall to the bottom line as we think about fifth third and fifth third in the middle of a normalizing rate cycle what is your view of reinvesting later years right after the ppp headwinds dissipate versus taking that rate generated additional income and reinvesting it gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp first off were always going to continue erika invest in the future of this company were in it for long haul we never do anything focused on the quarter or even for a full year so well continue to invest look at our technology investments its been running around you can expect were going to continue to do that were also going to continue to invest in our ability to expand this franchise both geography product sets through our verticals capabilities in our talent capabilities so well continue to invest in those areas obviously wages are another area were going to have to continue to step up on and be aggressive on which we have been as a leader in the minimum wage going from to to to we took that pain before most of our peers did we saw the need to do that so as you think about our investment were going to continue to invest but we also believe a lot of the guidance were giving right now this year when you think about the first three to four five increases on the rate side of the house most of that will fall to the bottom line as we already got our investment structure put in place for beyond that well continue to think about our investments if necessary you can expect some of that then will start to continue to turn into future investments but i think as you look at this year the guidance we provided most of that would fall to the bottom line erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of ken usdin from jefferies your line is open fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning jamie youve been steadfast in your view of holding back on the liquidity deployment and we see that again this quarter just wanted as weve seen quite a change in what the potential outlook for rates looks like any different views here about how you expect to use excess liquidity and look at the securities book going forward james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp so in the prepared remarks we talked about deploying billion per quarter into the investment portfolio a little more detail around our thinking there is that weve been patient we were fortunate to be able to be patient we have a very well positioned portfolio heading into the pandemic and so its afforded us this opportunity to wait weve always said we wanted to get to the entry points we got that visibility at the back half of december and so weve put some money to work in december and then weve continued to do that here in january and expect to do it as the year progresses should rates continue the curve continues to steepen and we perhaps could choose to move a little bit faster and if they dip back down we may choose to step off the gas a little bit in terms of the investment but what were investing in were really focused on structure right now we finished the year with the bullet and lockedout cash flows at i would expect that number to get a little bit higher as we deploy a portion of the excess cash so lets call it to of the allotment that we have for the security portfolio currently of billion so well reinvest cash flows well add a little bit of leverage during the course of the year and look for us to do that in more structured product ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great and my followup is just exit on your securities portfolio yields and following on that point you just made about the lockedout cash flows can you help us understand how you see that trajecting inside your overall nii outlook in the moment thanks james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thanks very good question we expect yields for the portfolio to be in the to range this year and thats with reinvesting and adding the additional leverage the one component to the portfolio yield that is a little bit lumpy is the prepayment penalties its one of the advantages you get from the bullet structure that we have and we were beneficiaries of it in the fourth quarter weve had a little bit thus far in january and we would expect some of that as the year progresses but thats the one item that makes it a little more challenging but i would expect call it to basis points of erosion as the year progresses but then some prepayment penalties bolstering the yield so that we end up in that to range for the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc your line is open fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning greg good morning jamie gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hi gerard james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jamie can you elaborate you gave some interesting numbers on the dividend acquisition when you talk about the life of loans in terms of the roas and profitability can you give us some more information or just elaborate on how youre going to grow that business and why the profitability appears to be so high in that business james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp ill start and then ill turn it over to tim to add a little more color but thanks for the question gerard in terms of the loans and why they scream so profitably right now its offered as a to 25year term the coupon the customer is paying is in the range but the tax incentives are significant and allows a merchant discount to be paid and that merchant discount could add as much as percentage points to the yield given that the loans end up being about a fiveyear life so you end up in the type of federal benefit as part of the energy tax credit program so there are some moving parts here the yield will ebb and flow as a result of how that merchant discount plays out in the ultimate weighted average life but that is why on the surface it is a very profitable business more so than some of the other consumer origination channels that we have and this is an area that we even talked about at several of the conferences in as a key challenge for fifth third is really improving the technology and the distribution around home equity lending and other consumer pointofsale origination channels so timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah i think to jamies point i mean point one gerard as it relates to the way that you grow it is its easier to grow when you have a strong tailwind and theres no question when you look at the level of investment thats going to go into home improvement over the course of the next to years focused on sustainability there is a really significant opportunity i mean dividends business today has been primarily on the solar panel side of the business but in addition to that theres storage which is a fastgrowing sector theres energy efficiencyrelated investments whether thats hvac or windows or green landscaping or otherwise and then i think as we continue to see this push toward electric vehicles theres a dynamic as it relates to high voltage currency into different parts of the homes than you needed previously fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 so all those categories are going to be big drivers of secular growth in the broader home improvement sector and with dividends positioning and the investments that have been made in this endtoend technology platform i think we believe theyre pretty uniquely positioned to benefit and to continue to gain share there i mean this is to call it a pointofsale platform is almost to understate what it is its a fully integrated endtoend solution that allows contractors to drive quoting to specify the sort of technical details around the installation itself there are thirdparty data checks on the appropriateness of what is being installed given the weather environment and the power generation potential and the local utility rates which are obviously very customer friendly but also a good guardrail for the contractors themselves they have apis directly into the largest contractors crm system so in many cases there isnt a thirdparty pointofsale at all its just generated out of the ipad application that the contractor is using to begin with and then all manner of downstream capabilities including not funding loans until theres actually power coming off of the panels today that provide a really excellent customer experience so as they come into fifth third they obviously have the benefit of our balance sheet thats one less thing that these fintech credit monolines otherwise would need to do in terms of recruiting bank funding partners so we should be able to improve the product innovation velocity the way that we have with provide bluntly provides launched more products in the last six months than they had in the three years prior okay on the financing side i think the other obvious benefit is while we are not believers in the way that some are and the opportunities associated with indirect lending to checking account crosssell they are very obvious loantoloan opportunities here whether its the fifth third mortgage servicing portfolio and providing an extension of credit there or leveraging our ability to underwrite and manage home equity and to connect that with a replenishable open to buy against whats an installment loan or otherwise so i think that is how we the first point of growth here is going to be make sure we get the talent in well continue to make investments in the technology platform benefit from the secular growth and then were going to add capabilities that a bank can have in this case gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup jamie when looking at your balance sheet obviously your loantodeposit ratio is quite low as per the industry because of the deposit growth you touched on what you think deposits could do what do you think is a optimal loantodeposit ratio for fifth third and how long would it take to reach that level considering the puts and takes of whats going on in the marketplace today james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah as you pointed out its certainly a low loantodeposit ratio in the mid right now its certainly far better than i think our at least in my career our highest number was back in was like so i think the optimal ratio is probably somewhere in between id like to operate the balance sheet in the or so range which is why we would be willing to have some of the more ratesensitive deposits run off during the fed tightening cycle but also and more importantly is that we do expect significant loan growth as we talked about 10plusbillion could be billion to billion next year and so thats going to help give a nice notch up in the loantodeposit ratio but it probably takes us a couple of years to get back to the number that we would i think like to operate and that would be indicative of a very productive balance sheet gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 great appreciate the color thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of bill carcache from wolfe research your line is open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning everyone gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc jamie can you speak to whether theres a risk that some of the upward pressure youre seeing on expenses maybe out of your control if you could just frame your confidence level and being able to manage ph with low rate and spread environment such that you continue to achieve positive operating leverage even under different inflation scenarios james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah we feel very confident in our ability to manage expenses its one of the things thats been a hallmark of the company under gregs leadership is the expectation that every year every area has to get more efficient its just a base expectation when we go through our planning and you see it in the results so heading into this year theres million of savings that im highly confident we will achieve through the lean process automation through the branch consolidations and the vendor savings but then as greg pointed out we do want to invest in our employees and in our franchise to really drive that revenue growth so i think weve got a good approach here where were balancing the revenue growth and sales expansion of the company while leaning out the support functions and then to your main point of the question when it comes to inflation wages we have a stronger merit pool this year and we have the special equity grant that we mentioned earlier to help improve retention but that comes at a cost and that is baked into our guide and our guide was to be up on a standalone basis the dividend acquisition adds up or so to the expense number which is how we ended up in the to range but as greg said were really focused on the longterm performance doing the right thing in the long run and i think our expense discipline helps drive that and it may appear to an outsider when you look at the numbers that theres not a lot of activity there because things are fairly stable the reality is we are driving a lot of savings but were choosing to reinvest those savings to improve the company for the long run bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful thank you as a followup for greg i wanted to ask a strategic question when you look at the success youve had with some of the bolton deals youve done do you see a time where youll want to continue to expand into new markets beyond those youre already in through digital channels without the need for fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 traditional ma and all the disruption that they can bring or are the i guess the focus of focusing on your digital investments and serving customers in your existing markets gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp first off every ceo says theyre a relationship bank but we really live and breathe being a relationship bank as evidenced by our commitment to have our employees back in the office focus on taking care of the customer so we think our digital channels its really about how we reach our customers and how we service our customers and doing that bestinclass so right now were pleased with the expansion markets that were focused on right now as we look at those theres probably a couple of other markets that were interested in if we find the right talent we will go into those markets but its all based on the talent i dont see us necessarily leading with a digital play at this point on the consumer side in markets that were not in today from a brickandmortar perspective i dont see that happening in the near term i dont think we need to do that i dont think its a good business for us as we mentioned before were flushed with liquidity we got strong household growth the profitability in our retail franchise has never been stronger so we think the model we have right now which provide the brickandmortar services call center services both our digital capabilities is the best model for us today now obviously were not going to be naive and or bury your head in the sand as what the future might hold but if that opportunity present itself that makes sense we have our capabilities to do those expansions with our technology and theyre designed for that but well take advantage of that opportunity if it makes sense at some point in the future if it materializes bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thank you for taking my questions gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp all right thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc set off the starting gun for loan growth so what you grew like annualized commercial loans or up billion and what you described i guess what onethird drawdown and roughly split on middle market large corporate fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 you talked about inventory build and capital expenditures so i think you gave a nice summary of all that but what had happened to the supply chain disruptions and the delay in loan growth later did the supply chain disruption go away really the question is why now timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah i mean mike its tim spence hello no i think the supply chain issues are still real we have many clients who say theyd like to be running at inventory levels that are above where theyre at i just think we took share this year i mean thats the reason i anchored back to this point about our having record new relationship growth new quality relationship growth into the commercial bank anecdotally when you get into the ground there wasnt a geographic market that didnt add doubledigit new relationships this year then you go out and you talk to those clients and then literally they were housed relationships at other places who either associated with the disruption or who felt like they were not getting what they needed in terms of the breadth of capabilities or who followed a banker that we managed to attract into our franchise over time who chose to move from another financial institution to fifth third so i think that is the reason that we managed to grow at the rate that we did despite the fact that there are still natural constraints to inventory building and that we havent yet seen the pop quite at the level that we expect to see although we did get some benefit of that associated with the ma activity i think the one other thing i would tell you is there was an inflection point this year in our pipelines when we got people back into the office and we started seeing clients in person in april of this past year and the level of activity that we generate through our one bank model which is the relationship management model thats been in place here for more than a decade is really core to the way that we grow the business and i think we saw the outcomes of that over the course of the year in terms of the acceleration of loan growth and production in particular mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so not to put words in your mouth im looking for validation as it relates to loan growth the pandemic is over gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp the last i checked the pandemic isnt over richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah were all looking at each other trying to figure out who is going to take that one gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp but i do think the supply chain constraints i think the labor shortages and so forth are here to stay for a while i dont see that ebbing at all as we go into the year but i think people are adjusting i think corporations are adjusting i think theyre figuring out ways to do things more efficiently as tim said theres not a customer we talk to where labor is not an issue theres not a customer we talked to where they wouldnt like to build more inventory faster but i think weve just done a good job of banking these customers and taking those relationships fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 but itll still be a challenging environment as we move forward but were very optimistic in investments weve made in the geographies and people and capabilities and we just feel like weve got the right formula right now james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah mike i would say that while the pandemic is not over were navigating it quite well with all of the strategies that tim and greg have laid out and that were very bullish on that loan growth for in addition to the provide acquisition now adding dividend finance to the fifth third family mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just one clarification so clearly youre pursuing build not buy but part of that decision not to pursue bank deals you said its because of the communication of washington dc about the regulatory scrutiny on mergers over billion that specifically is holding you back some even if you wanted to gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah but well tell you if we wanted to and if we thought there was a right opportunity another if thats out there that makes sense thats actionable i would be very concerned as a ceo to try to introduce an opportunity right now into the regulatory environment with some of the constraints that are out there i think on how theyre thinking about mergers until i get some of those items addressed dealt with figured out i just think its going to be problematic for a period of time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi guys gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hi matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc you talked about how overdraft or the nsf fees are lower for you guys than peers i think it was last month and rolled out some changes just remind us what the impact to revenues might be this year and kind of longer term fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 and then is there any kind of additional changes youre thinking of making given some announcements from bigger banks as well thanks timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yes matt its tim thanks so just to recap i mean we talked a lot about the fact that weve been among the least reliant banks on punitive fees for a while now and about the fact that that really was a part of about a three to fouryear journey that we have been on to improve the checking value proposition and then really to get out of the business of charging customers when something went wrong as opposed to charging them because weve added value and given them the tools to manage liquidity more effectively and it was because of all the forces you see people reacting to today so i think weve been very clear about whats in the momentum banking proposition the fact that it offers the broadest suite of tools to avoid an overdraft that we talked a little bit about in the fourth quarter the fact that we made changes in october including things like changing posting orders increasing the de minimis negative balance threshold lowering the limit on the number of daily occurrences i think essentially the same things youre hearing from others today lastly the one other item that has been on the road map that we are moving forward which is eliminating nsf fees and we do intend to do that at the end of the second quarter all those changes are incorporated into the fee outlook so you should not expect an incremental negative from fifth third associated with the evolution of the way that we think about helping customers manage shortterm liquidity matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then separately a bit of a random question but youre a very big auto lending bank to consumers and as we think about car prices being up so much especially used cars have you thought about kind of underwriting a bit different youve got really good disclosures in your appendix the ltvs have come down a little bit fico up a little bit when i read about used car prices up i just think to myself underwriting to that may not be a great idea but i dont know how youre thinking about that by just being a big player part of that richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah thanks for the question its richard from an underwriting standpoint we do think about how values have changed but i think its important to understand we look at loantovalues we look at the supplydemand dynamics for autos we dont think thats going to change in the near term certainly and i think the dynamics around how the oems actually produce and sell cars are going to create a continued tightness if you will in terms of supply i think the days of the oems filling the factory and flooding the market with cars are done theyre are going to be more disciplined thats going to give us more certainty around used car prices over time the other thing ill add is we are a prime and superprime underwriter from an auto perspective and so while the collateral value is important its the quality of the borrower that really stands tall for us and that hasnt changed for us at all and we continue to see the tailwinds around the consumer from a quality perspective to be strong so no real changes in terms of the underwriting criteria were mindful of supplydemand dynamics and do consider what car prices will do in the future fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and remind me the mix of new versus used car lending that you did james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp its used in timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp and i dont think its ever been outside of the one way or the other james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp we live in the sort of roughly evenly balanced range matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay perfect thanks so much operator now that we have reached the end of our qa
