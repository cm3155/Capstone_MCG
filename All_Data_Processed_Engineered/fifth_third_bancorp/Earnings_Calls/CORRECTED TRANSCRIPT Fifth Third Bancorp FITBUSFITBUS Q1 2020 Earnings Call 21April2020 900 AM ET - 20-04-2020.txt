all of you for joining us this morning given the unprecedented nature of the current environment i will focus most of my commentary on the proactive steps we are taking to navigate this crisis due to the pandemic and then tayfun will provide more details related to the quarterly financial results in his remarks as all of you are aware the events over the past couple of months related to the covid19 health crisis and resulting economic fallout has led us to reprioritize our focus we are taking significant and ongoing actions to serve our customers protect our employees and assist our communities we believe these proactive steps will ultimately deliver longterm sustainable value for all stakeholders including our shareholders starting in early february the executive team and the board began actively planning and prioritizing the organizations response efforts we quickly mobilized our workforce to accommodate remote access for a large number of employees currently more than of our workforce is working remotely across the company and for many groups that number is over for employees who are not able to do their job remotely we have established social distancing and enhanced cleaning measures based on cdc guidelines throughout these uncertain times we have been proactively communicating with our customers and employees we have issued more than a dozen press releases several fact sheets and numerous proactive outreaches to our customers in addition to ongoing updates on our website we have also significantly increased the frequency of communications with our employees in order to keep them informed of the latest developments recommendations and health precautions from a customer perspective we are leveraging the strength of our balance sheet to help address the economic challenges many of our customers are facing we are prudently extending credit to customers in order to support economic activity in march alone we extended billion of new credit including approximately billion from ci line draws in addition to keeping our traditional lending channels open we are also participating in governmentsponsored programs established as part of the cares act such as the sba ppp and the forthcoming main street lending program with respect to ppp we assisted approximately clients who employ over employees totaling nearly billion to maximize our support we recently announced we suspended share repurchases and as tayfun will discuss in greater detail we continue to have strong capital and liquidity levels to weather a prolonged downturn in addition to utilizing our strong balance sheet we are directly supporting consumers and businesses by keeping of our branches open and fully operational with modified health protocols and amended hours as appropriate we continue to process over branch transactions per day underpinning our role as an essential service provider and for many of their banking needs we continue to encourage our customers to use our highly rated digital platforms in addition to our network of approximately feefree atms furthermore we continue to proactively engage with our customers our bankers have personally connected with million customers over the past month to see how they are doing under these circumstances both personally and financially and to offer assistance as needed under our extensive financial hardship relief programs in fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 march we began providing relief in the form of payment deferrals and forbearances to customers across a wide array of lending products we also suspended vehicle repossessions and home foreclosures since the roll of our assistance programs we have processed over hardship requests which represents approximately billion in fifth third loan balances in addition to billion from our mortgage servicing portfolio as i mentioned taking care of our employees is a top priority in addition to our safety measures we have announced special payments of up to per employee for those providing essential banking services these measures have helped maintain call center operations and branch personnel at appropriate levels for our communities we recently committed nearly million in philanthropic funds to help address the effects of covid19 pandemic we will continue to take proactive and aggressive measures to help mitigate the effects of the downturn from a macro perspective while we do not know the duration or severity of the crisis we have spent many years preparing for a downturn by strengthening our balance sheet through a disciplined approach to credit and by increasing our capital and liquidity levels we have also improved and diversified our revenue streams in our loan portfolios finally we evaluate our firmwide resilience through stress testing our balance sheet under a range of conditions worse than the last crisis and more severe than a regulatoryrun stress test since the financial crisis we have taken several steps which have put us in a very strong position we transformed our overall approach to credit risk management centralized credit underwriting and added stringent geographic sector and product level concentration limits we exited certain commercial real estate segments and have remained disciplined in our existing cre portfolio with client selection focused on toptier developers and virtually no land loans we also continue to maintain an underweight position relative to our peers we exited businesses such as commodity trader lending and mezzanine lending three years ago we exited billion in commercial loans given the riskreturn profile this has helped reduce our leveraged lending exposures by over we have also reduced our indirect commercial leasing portfolio by almost billion over the past two years which has significantly lowered our exposure to certain assets such as commercial aircrafts and railcars lastly we have maintained our credit discipline in our consumer portfolio with a weighted average fico score above we have consistently communicated our throughthecycle principles of disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and an overall balance sheet management approach focused on longterm performance horizon our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we navigate this environment our first quarter operating results reflect the strength of our franchise and the strategic decisions we made in managing our balance sheet our interest rate risk and our liquidity risk exposures in light of the rapid and widespread economic deterioration we saw towards the end of the quarter net interest income net interest margin noninterest income and expenses all performed in line with or better than our january guidance with the net chargeoff ratio also consistent with our previous expectations tayfun will discuss the changes in our allowance in more detail similar to what you have seen from many of our peers our fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 reserves reflect the cecl adoption the economic impacts of covid19 lower oil prices and the impact of loan growth during the quarter as i mentioned earlier we believe that we are in a very strong position from both a capital and liquidity perspective we are continuing to evaluate potential economic scenarios but we currently believe our capital position is strong enough to maintain our current dividend if these conditions persist through the end of the year while remaining well capitalized before i turn over to tayfun to discuss our results and our outlook id like to once again thank our employees i am very proud of the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers our communities and each other as we navigate these unprecedented times with that ill turn it over to tayfun to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook tayfun tuzun chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thank you greg good morning and thank you for joining us today our company is well positioned to deliver on our pledge to provide financial support to our customers communities and employees during the current pandemic and the duration of the economic downturn it is important to note that despite the unexpected timing and nature of the events that led to the sudden decline in economic activity we are entering this downturn from a position of balance sheet strength that was built through the actions that weve taken during the past few years although it is impossible to predict the timing of inflection points in the economy with precision since late we had been anticipating an eventual change in the economic cycle after a record expansion period our client selection capital interest rate and liquidity risk management decisions have all reflected that expectation what makes this downturn more challenging than others is clearly the unexpected nature of the initial trigger and the ensuing low visibility surrounding the depth and duration of the downturn all parts of the global economy are entering this cycle at the same time but the unprecedented level of fiscal and monetary actions will undoubtedly provide a level of support to cushion a portion of the economic setback the actions that we have taken so far and those that we will be taking in the coming months will focus on maintaining and leveraging our strength to support our clients and stand by them as we help them manage through this difficult period as always we incorporate all information that is available to us at the time when we provide commentary about our business and discuss our expectations our overall perspective on the next few quarters had been very negative at the end of the first quarter even before the rapid deterioration in the data and market expectations that we have seen over the past couple of weeks as we look at the economy today we do not expect a vshaped recovery our discussions on relevant factors including credit will be based on an assumption that it will take a number of quarters before we see visible signs of recovery what is unclear is the interaction between the fiscal and monetary programs and the pace of the recovery and what the new run rate will be after that point fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 turning to slide with respect to the first quarter we are pleased with our overall financial performance despite the economic disruption our performance in january and february was ahead of our expectations once again our net interest income net interest margin noninterest income and noninterest expenses for the full quarter all performed in line with or better than our guidance credit quality remained strong during the quarter chargeoffs were consistent with our prior expectations and the npa ratio decreased basis points sequentially reported results for the quarter included a negative impact from several notable items including a credit valuation adjustment for client derivatives a charge related to the valuation of the visa total return swap the impact of mb mergerrelated charges and a mark in our private equity portfolio in addition to the impact of the provision in excess of chargeoffs adjusting for those items and the purchase accounting impact shown in our earnings materials first quarter pre provision net revenue increased from the prior year excluding the first quarter seasonal impacts on compensation and benefits expenses ppnr increased sequentially our core return on tangible common equity excluding aoci increased from the prior year to nearly and our efficiency ratio continues to trend towards the top quartile among peers moving to slide total average loans increased sequentially with growth balanced between the consumer and commercial portfolios prior to the market disruption in march total loan growth was generally tracking in line with our previous guidance growth in average commercial loans was impacted by the line draws of approximately billion in march since the end of the quarter line utilization has remained very stable average commercial real estate loans were flat sequentially with the construction book declining by our cre balances as a percentage of total riskbased capital remained very low around which is significantly lower than our exposures prior to the last downturn which stood at average total consumer loans grew from last quarter in general our consumer portfolio trends from the past year or so continued again during the first two months with the auto portfolio leading the growth reflecting strong production of billion with healthy spreads and the same risk return parameters as before clearly the origination activity significantly slowed down in march and in the nearterm we expect the weakness to continue the quarteroverquarter growth in auto was partially offset by a decline in home equity balances average deposits were up in addition our endofperiod deposit growth exceeded our endofperiod loan growth which enabled us to maintain very strong liquidity levels during the quarter even when we experienced very high utilization rates the ability to grow deposits so strongly while reducing deposit rates by basis points during the quarter shows the strength of our franchise in our relationshipbased banking model moving on to slide reported net interest income increased million compared to the prior quarter with adjusted nii increasing million the strong nii performance reflects the impact of our billion cash flow hedge portfolio as well as the wider than normal libor fed fund spread near the end of the quarter purchase accounting adjustments benefited our first quarter net interest margin by basis points this quarter compared to basis points last quarter our reported nim increased basis point and the adjusted nim increased basis points sequentially which was at the upper end of our january guidance fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 our nim performance reflected the benefits of our balance sheet hedges proactive management of deposit rates and a lower day count the excess shortterm liquidity levels in the first quarter caused a basis point drag on our nim compared to last quarter interestbearing core deposit rates were down basis points during the quarter better than our previous guidance range of to basis points we expect interestbearing core deposit costs to decline another to basis points over the next two quarters and be heavily frontloaded in the second quarter this forecast combined with the deposit rate actions we have taken since the third quarter of last year in response to the fed rate moves results in a cumulative beta in the mid in the nearterm we intend to maintain higherthannormal liquidity as we continue to gauge the duration of the line draws and the corresponding deposit growth that we witnessed over the past month excluding the impact of ppp loans we expect our loan to core deposit ratio to remain stable in the second quarter as a reminder our margin is approximately twothirds sensitive to the front end of the curve which results in a to basis point reduction in nim per basis points move in fed funds and onethird to the long end which results together in a cumulative to basis point impact it is worth noting once again that our differentiated hedge and securities portfolios are expected to provide strong nim protection on a relative basis we executed our hedges early when the 10year was around and also structured them to provide protection for much longer than most peers with hedge protection against lower rates through and as we have discussed before our securities portfolio is also structured in a way that is meaningfully different than peers which results in significantly lower cash flows and less stress on the portfolio yield our net premium amortization was under million during the quarter moving on to slide we had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided in january the resilience in our fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved adjusted noninterest income increased by sequentially despite the march headwinds compared to our previous expectation of down coming into the quarter the strong performance was driven by mortgage banking client financial risk management and wealth and asset management revenues mortgage banking revenue of million increased million sequentially reflecting the widening of primary secondary spreads and strong volumes combined with the impact of the msr valuation net of hedges origination volume of billion increased sequentially and from the year ago quarter as customers took advantage of the lower rate environment to refinance we expect second quarter mortgage revenue to be adversely impacted by covid19 in our commercial business we generated another strong quarter of capital markets revenues which were up over from the year ago quarter client financial risk management revenue was very strong this quarter reflecting investments in talent and technology the continued focus to deepen client relationships as well as the market volatility during the end of the quarter wealth and asset management revenue increased from the prior quarter due to higher brokerage and seasonally strong tax prep fees we continued the aum flow momentum again this quarter despite the broader market dynamics fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 given the current portfolio allocations we expect our wealth and asset management revenue to experience approximately a ph beta relative to the sp on about a month lag deposit service charges declined slightly this quarter commercial deposit fees were positively impacted by deductions in earnings credit rate and solid gross tm revenue which was offset by seasonal declines in consumer fees moving on to slide first quarter reported pretax expenses included mergerrelated items totaling million and intangible amortization expense of million adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our materials noninterest expense increased sequentially well below our previous guidance of in line with previous years our first quarter expenses were impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes excluding these seasonal items our total expenses in the first quarter would have been down approximately sequentially in the current environment there will be a natural decline in expense items that are directly tied to business performance and activity in addition we recognize that as we navigate this environment investments in projects with lower returns will need to be reprioritized which gives us the ability to evaluate a wide range of potential actions as we develop better visibility on the extent and duration of the downturn several of these items will be actionable we will provide more details on our expense management in this environment in the coming months in march at the rbc conference we provided a snapshot picture of our exposures to covid19 high impact sectors slide provides an update for quarter end exposures and also expands our scope of highly impacted industries to include nonessential retail and exposures to healthcare facilities we are also adding more information on the utilization rates and the percentage of the portfolio that is described as highly leveraged the totals on this page represent of our total loans and approximately onethird of our total leverage loan portfolio which at the end of the quarter was just over billion in outstandings we believe that in these segments our client selection has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that have access to capital in stressed environments of our total ci loans in the industries most stressed by covid19 are shared national credits in addition on slide we give you a snapshot of our energy portfolio this portfolio is less levered and more hedged than the portfolio before the last downturn in oil prices nearly of the portfolio is in reservebased lending during the disruption we experienced approximately million in losses in the current environment we estimate that the production breakeven is about per barrel on slide we give you an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios the fico scores clearly indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over of the portfolio containing fico scores of or higher on a balanceweighted basis approximately of the consumer portfolio is secured and as you can see by our fico band distributions our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high prime super prime space from a hardship perspective only of the mortgage forbearance requests have ltvs greater than except for those with guarantees or insurance also in february we further tightened our underwriting standards specifically on minimum fico scores and maximum ltv levels fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 turning to credit results on slide net chargeoffs remained near historically low levels during the quarter the consumer net chargeoff ratio was down basis points and commercial was up basis points sequentially resulting in a total net chargeoff ratio of basis points consistent with our previous expectations npas continue to be well behaved up just sequentially given the loan portfolio dynamics i mentioned earlier the npa ratio was down basis points sequentially obviously with the adoption of cecl we substantially increased our reserves at the beginning of the quarter and given the covid19 impact and loan growth our provision was of chargeoffs slide provides an overview of the major changes in our loans our day one build was million consistent with our previous guidance and includes million from the mb portfolio as we discussed previously which was significantly impacted by the disparate manner in which purchase accounting discounts were treated under the incurred model versus the cecl model the postday one incremental allowance during the quarter was based on several factors a significantly weaker economic outlook including a lower oil price higher funded loan balances and the impact of unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus the overall approach is a combination of quantitative modelbased estimates and qualitative overlays we use a threeyear reasonable and supportable period followed by a twoyear reversion to historic losses the quantitative process is based on multiple economic scenarios the expectation for the two predominant macroeconomic factors is a sharp downturn in gdp and a rise in unemployment in the next two quarters the impacts of which are partially cushioned by the aggressive levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus leading to a very weak recovery in the fourth quarter the challenge associated with calibrating our expectations is as other banks have discussed the speed at which the realtime updates of economic forecasts are changing the base scenario assumes that gdp growth will slowly start to recover in the fourth quarter and will reach a yearoveryear growth of approximately in with the unemployment rate remaining above throughout the more stressful scenario has gdp continuing to decline through the first quarter of and unemployment staying about for almost the entire threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the oil price under the base case reaches in the fourth quarter but under the more stressful scenario remains below through as a reference point we compare our current reserve level with the nine quarter total loss estimates within the two most recent severe stress test runs that we ran including the stress test that we ran last year despite the fact that we were not required to submit and the stress test that we recently submitted to the fed in addition to the most recent fedrun adverse and severe stress tests from our current reserves stand at of the nine quarter cumulative losses projected under the fed adverse scenario of the nine quarter losses under the fed severe scenario of the nine quarter losses under the severe scenario and of the nine quarter losses under the severe scenario that we just submitted fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 in the absence of better visibility on future levels of economic activity these reference points give you some guidance on the strength of our current acl ratio of in addition we still have approximately million or basis points of our total loans in remaining discount associated with the mb portfolio as other management teams have mentioned during their earnings calls most of the economic scenarios published since the end of the quarter are forecasting a weaker outlook compared to previous forecasts as more quantitative and qualitative information becomes available we will incorporate them into our reserve analysis as the significant fiscal and monetary support is likely to reduce the impact of both the nearterm decline in the gdp and the increase in unemployment the more meaningful impact on reserve levels will be the shape of the recovery and the level of the economic activity in the postrecovery period turning to slide our capital and liquidity positions remained very strong during the quarter our cet1 ratio ended the quarter at over basis points above the wellcapitalized minimum given the various dynamics during the quarter we are providing you a cet1 reconciliation between net income rwa growth cecl adoption and the impact of dividends as a reminder we did not repurchase shares during the first quarter as you can see the majority of the basis point change in cet1 was attributable to line draws from the commercial book along with the impact of cecl dividend payouts constitute a smaller portion of the change in cet1 understandably the topic of dividend sustainability is of major interest to our shareholders we believe that we are similar to other banks in that we are entering this downturn from a position of strength and that strength will be able to withstand severe downturns that does not mean that dividends will be sustainable in all scenarios but at this time we expect to maintain our dividends which our board will continue to evaluate based on the data available our tangible book value per share was this quarter up yearoveryear we have grown our book value for five consecutive quarters at the end of the quarter our unrealized pretax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately billion which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios from a liquidity perspective we have over billion in readily available and contingent liquidity although we are no longer subject to the lcr we have since continued to stress test our positions on a monthly basis under seven different types of liquidity scenarios and we then hold ourselves to the most stressful scenario our liquid securities positions have not changed since our phaseouts of the lcr rule slide provides a summary of our current outlook given the uncertain environment we are withdrawing our previous full year guidance until we get more visibility on the economic environment for the second quarter based on the line draws at the end of the first quarter and ppp activities we expect lowdouble digit growth in average commercial loans and relatively stable consumer loans net interest income should grow slightly as a result of higher loan outstandings while nim tightens based on my earlier discussion on our interest rate sensitivity in addition to the impact of the rate environment nim will also be impacted by the ppp loans and the amount of shortterm liquidity on the balance sheet noninterest income and expenses are both expected to decline by highsingle to lowdouble digits from their current levels reflecting the impact of covid19related impacts total net chargeoffs are expected to be in the to basis points range fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 in summary our first quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress weve made over the past few years improving our resiliency diversifying our revenues and proactively managing the balance sheet that being said we are in an unprecedented environment right now and have limited visibility with respect to the economic path forward we will continue to rely on the same principles disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and a focus on longterm performance horizon which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll senior vice president directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks tayfun before we start qa as a courtesy to others we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup question and then return to the queue if you have additional questions we will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning during the questionandanswer period please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator laura please open the call for questions question and answer section operator all right thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of saul martinez from ubs your line is now open saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask about the outlook for credit and the interplay there with your reserving and as you highlighted tayfun your reserve levels are very high versus and theyre especially high versus peers so the basis points is not only high versus other regionals but i think even more striking is just within product category ci at basis points youre way above i think anybody who ive seen report on reserve ratios on resi and home equity despite seeming the highquality portfolio so i know theres a lot and you talked about your estimates and your process and your assumptions but i guess i just wanted your perspective a little bit on to what extent your reserving is a function of taking maybe a more conservative stance than others within the confines of plausible scenarios or to what extent it actually reflects perhaps a riskier portfolio or at least a portfolio that might be more susceptible to a downturn in terms of the impact on lifetime losses tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thanks saul good question obviously it is a broad question and the difficulty here is the environment has changed so quickly it is difficult to compare one banks ratios and coverage to anothers but having said that what we gave you on page of the slide presentation is a similar set of coverage numbers for stress test runs fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 that other banks have and clearly our coverage levels are exceeding those losses that we have predicted through our models compared to other banks what we have done is we have incorporated the as the environment continued to deteriorate in march into the end of the quarter and basically reflected a fairly drastic change in the economic environment not only in the second or third quarter but try to project a weaker recovery into the second year and third year because we are looking at a threeyear rs period here saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp and i gave you some statistics around our assumptions in our minds the current fiscal and monetary policies are likely to cushion the second and third quarter impacts but are not going to be necessarily providing a significant support to the latter years so our reserve levels as conservative as they are at do reflect a slowly recovering economy rather than a vshaped recovery underlying those numbers is also the quality of the portfolio that we have we shared with you statistics on our consumer and mortgage portfolios and we are also sharing some details on the commercial book the commercial book i think jamie and richard can comment on the commercial book but the portions of the commercial books that are exposed to covid19 also tend to be the book that has more large corporate exposures more heavy snc exposures so all of those combined its hard to compare our numbers to another but we do believe that weve appropriately accounted for a weak outlook slow recovery and the quality of the portfolio that we have in place jamie or richard i dont know ph if you guys want to add to that james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yeah saul so as i stepped into this chair and started looking at the portfolio the one thing that stands out to me is just how intentional we have been about where we do business with the clients that we select that should be resilient in times of stress and frankly the focus for us has been on companies with larger scale that should be able to persevere in this environment and so our loan book i would tell you is comprised of highquality liquid resilient names and the best data we could use to prove that point is the shared national credit information that we included on the page and as you can see its a very high percentage its saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it indiscernible fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp that also suggests that this is like obviously we continue to evaluate the data as it comes we continue to evaluate these new programs and at the end of this quarter well do that evaluation again just like every other bank will do and then well share with you the results of our analysis saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay and i know this gets into the weeds but some elements of your modeling threeyear reasonable supportable and what not maybe on the more conservative side than some other peers but one followup question you did have the second consecutive quarter where you had a pretty elevated amount of nonperforming loan formation in your commercial book if you can talk to that and was any of that related to sort of the accounting noise with pci moving to pcd and then getting reclassified into nonaccrual or was there actually something underlying that that is suggesting some worsening credit trend in some parts of your book james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yeah so on the first part of the question theres very little impact on the pci to pcd transition so the npa inflows that you see in the deck of about million was driven by several factors one about a third of the inflow was a single real estate mall exposure about onefourth of the npa formation is actually in smaller businesses business banking lower middle market and then the remainder when you look at what drove it its really spread across industries and geographies but the one common thread is that theyre all predominantly in the service industry so professional medical education financial advisory so pretty widespread there saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i was wondering if you could comment at all in terms of the ppp loans going to i guess those small businesses that need them the most i mean obviously this is kind of a broader question than just fifth third but it seems like a little bit of a free for all and theres just been some articles out there about maybe some bigger companies fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 getting the loans and not really kind of criteria for deciding who gets it and just wondering if you could comment on that on your thoughts gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah matt this is greg as i mentioned we processed about loans for our customers to the tune about billion the average loan size is about so that so our portfolio i think was pretty broad based but we did a good job i think of servicing both the lmi community of businesses small businesses in general very few of our loans were up for that million to million range so for our portfolio i think we did a pretty good job of getting as much through the system as we could in the short time that we had available the system was available to us hopefully that gets refunded tomorrow at the latest weve got more resources there because we definitely have a larger pentup demand for the ppp program but overall with respect to fifth third i think we did a nice job and the size of our loans indicate that we served a large portion of the smaller businesses that are out there versus the larger business ive read the headlines ive seen some of the challenges that other banks are faced with as far as prioritizing loans we did not do that we worked as hard as we could to get as many loans through the system a lot of that depends on the complexity of the request itself and the ownership structure of companies kind of dictated how much we can get through at what pace if your loan got through or not but once again weve already input a significant additional number of applications and hopeful that the window will open here shortly and well get those through matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and any sense on call it what the pipeline is for when theres additional funding gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah well obviously i think most bankers would agree and most people would agree that the additional billion is not going to be adequate to serve the total demand thats out there right now we expect that billion to billion to be absorbed pretty quickly even faster than the last billion were absorbed so we think its going to be very fast and we dont think its going to be adequate we think the demand is going to outpace continue to outpace the available funds matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you helpful color gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thanks matt fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian from bank of america your line is now open erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch so just to piggy back off of sauls question you took a significant reserve build and still earned with the stock at and tangible book value per share of so clearly the market is fearful of tangible book erosion and i guess my question here is in the realistic scenarios for economic stress that you see and it seems like your band of expectations are reasonable do you see yourself continuing to earn positive earnings during the duration of this downturn tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good question i will not comment on this look i mean i think our away from reserve builds and loss expectations i think the underlying ppnr activity is going to continue to look good we intend to manage our expenses at an appropriate level relative to the environment we have a strong protection against a lower rate environment and we have diversified revenue streams so the company has strong ability to generate capital on earnings in this environment as i mentioned earlier it is a little difficult to predict exactly what will happen to the provision and the chargeoffs but clearly our intent is to continue to outpace the impact of the credit here and this is one of those environments where unfortunately looking longer than beyond one or two quarters is extremely difficult so we will give you a better update as we get a better read on the environment but obviously we believe strongly in our ability to manage this company at profitable levels erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you and just my followup question is you noted that there would be a total impact of to basis points on the net interest margin if we consider each basis point of decline in the short end plus whats happened to the long end and im wondering does that include the ppp impact and does that include the reduction in deposit cost you anticipate and how do you plan to fund the ppp loans that are coming on balance sheet thank you tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah so we did not give any nim guidance this quarter and that was on purpose i think the general dynamics around nim and the impact of lower shortterm rates and a flatter curve at lower rates is pretty set for us as i mentioned its to basis points per move the reason why we chose not to give guidance this quarter is because there are three i view the second quarter as a transitionary quarter there are three main impacts one fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 of them is the very high levels of liquidity that we are carrying on our books i mentioned that march carried a significantly more liquidity on our balance sheet here in early april were carrying even more because some of the government programs are starting to throw cash the second one is ppp as you mentioned and the third one is the libor fed funds spread we expect libor fed funds spread to tighten throughout the quarter from the current levels and what we also believe is the high level of liquidity that were carrying in our balance sheet is going to give us a better ability to manage the deposit rates down during the quarter so all those together the second quarter is going to be one of those quarters thats going to be very busy but beyond the second quarter that relationship between rate moves and the curve shape and our nim impact holds pretty tightly so to basis points is a pretty good number that you can use erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore iti sic evercore isi your line is now open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey john tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi thanks for the detail on slide i think its very helpful and i acknowledge that similar to the prior comments that your reserves are booked to a level thats higher than peers can you discuss your confidence in your reserve relative to the dfast numbers that you cited i guess there approximating around of dfast severe given that you are factoring in a ushape essentially versus a v why wouldnt you think that those numbers should be higher not that ive got a problem with it or anything im just saying if it is factoring in a u should that warrant possibly a level thats higher than about of the severe dfast thanks tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 yeah in order to achieve a better level of precision we need to know more about this environment we are giving you these reference points as a comparison i think the scenarios that underlie the dfast are known and they are quite severe but no stress scenario is like the other one and this one in particular is going to be very different in the sense that the support programs are yet to be evaluated with respect to how they impact the recovery path and where we are going to end up thats a big difference because in most classic stress tests usually the economy comes back at one point to where it starts what we dont know today is where this economy is going to end up when the recovery period flattens out to a plateau so im very hesitant to answer your question because we just dont know enough about the nature of this downturn but at least showing you the dfast results gives you the ability to compare us with others and then as this economy develops then we have the ability to reshape our expectations john pancari q analyst evercore isi no great okay thanks tayfun and then another question on the reserve do you have the allocation of the reserve to the high impact areas that you flagged james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp so we did not provide that john so relative to the one would assume its north of that number but we did not disclose that percentage john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thats fine and then one last question if i could just on the loan modifications how much of your loan modifications have been done on the commercial side of the portfolio and do you have any industry concentrations really where youre starting to see those deferrals thanks james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yeah so within the commercial segment weve actually had a fairly limited number of requests in the commercial side than the consumer side weve only had about or so and its predominantly covenant waivers for terms in and thats roughly billion of outstandings and thats led by car dealers hotels and restaurants when it comes to restructured or modified actual dollars thats very small to date with only million in loan balances and probably the one sector with most activity would be restaurants you see that on slide our billion in outstandings the good news is were favorably weighted with only is in dining and is fast food quick service so about of the book continues to remain open those that are closed are predominantly in the in dining category so overall some activity here in the modifications but its still a little early well see how it plays out over the course of the year john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks for taking my questions fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning greg good morning tayfun gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc you gave us very good detail on a number of your different risks that you have on the portfolios today and in the opening comments greg you mentioned that i think about fee waivers have been executed also deferrals on loans up to billion that i think represents just under of the consumer loan portfolio do you guys have any expectations of where those deferrals may peak out as a percentage of your portfolio gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah let me start and then ill just throw it over to jamie here first off its of hardship requests not fee waivers so its requests in total which a lot of that included obviously both forbearances and deferrals in our loan book also but the fee waiver is actually much smaller now jamie number is like is that the number james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yes about million in fee waivers yes and so gerard in terms of the hardship relief to date by product and this is through the end of last week so a little bit updated for april activity what were seeing is a lot of the fixed rate or fixed payment products have the higher request levels so auto is at mortgages in our owned portfolio are at of the portfolio and then as you see the minimum monthly payments lower in home equity and credit card theyre at and so as we model obviously we expect this to rise as unemployment rises but the ultimate amount of hardship relief that we give will ultimately depend on where unemployment peaks out and for us right now on most products were offering 90day loan payment deferrals and then in mortgage we offer the sixmonth forbearance so well continue to update you as the quarter transpires gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 thank you and then obviously the focus this quarter for you and others has always been on credit quality and the provisions equally as important tayfun as you pointed out is ppnr can you share with us your outlook for ppnr from the standpoint that obviously the second quarter endofperiod first quarter loans from the industry was extremely high due to the drawdowns and revenues obviously well benefit from that in the second quarter but as we get into the third and fourth quarters and the unemployment rate goes up underwriting standards tighten should we anticipate that ppnr revenues start to shrink for you guys just because of the environment were in tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp i think gerard heres my take on the year i do believe that assuming these drawdowns will stay with us for a while the higher loan balances will provide a decent amount of support against the lower rate environment and assuming that we manage the deposit rates down and our liquidity positions optimally the year despite the fact that it is the worstcase scenario beyond just negative interest rates for banks the balance sheet should support a decent healthy level of nii in terms of the sequence of quarters from second into third into fourth i think we will probably see a changing fee picture here because clearly the economy stopped and that will have a nearterm negative impact on fees in the second quarter from spend levels to asset management based on equity levels and to some capital markets activity our expectation is assuming that things start somehow normalizing either into the second half of the second quarter or the third quarter we should see a little healthier fee picture in the second half of the year and then the expense side of it we clearly are going to benefit from lower expenses that are tied to activity and then we will start making some decisions on our end based on this environment so in general you are going the second quarter definitely is going to be a transition quarter but i do believe that as we look into the third and fourth quarter we are going to start seeing some normalizing ppnr levels gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja from jpmorgan your line is now open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks can you hear me gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yes good morning vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc couple of questions firstly on your oil and gas exposure can you talk a little bit about where you are in your reservebased redetermination and what that could mean for the loans fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yes hey its richard were about a third of the way through the redeterminations and at this point weve seen about a drop in oilbased borrowing basis and about a drop for those that are gasbased producers vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then i think you said youve got a breakeven tayfun you said of production price richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah what tayfun was describing was we went through the portfolio and looked at the average breakeven lifting cost for our portfolio so think about what it takes to get it out of the ground and what it costs and what it would take to service interest for that portfolio thats about when you benchmark it to nymex what tayfun didnt give you and i think this is important for the portfolio we also say on slide the portfolio is hedged for those hedges give our producers about of benefit net benefit so if you think about you add the hedges to it its or breakeven vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and those hedges it sounds like a lot of them mature by the end of richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp what weve described on slide is the percentage of production that is hedged and its in and then it rolls down to in vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then what happens to those loans as those hedges roll off do you get to be done and the borrower has to figure out how to handle the funding or how does it work can you walk us through that richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp for those under our reservebased structure the borrowing base is redetermined every six months so there will be a fall redetermination that will be based on current production current reserves and the outlook from prices at that time so the borrowing base and the loan amount that were willing to lend gets reset every six months so to the extent prices improve that will change the borrowing base to the extent they dont the borrowing base would come down vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great and jamie any color on the casino exposure of billion fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp the casino exposure on slide the top part of the page of slide refers to lending to the operating companies within the casino and then the cre portion would be obviously the land and the hotel and going along with it really the names are large companies highquality resilient so again we feel like were well positioned and while there may be losses in this portfolio we feel like the lost content is very manageable richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp its richard again the only thing id add is in addition to highquality names were diversified by operator types some global operators some native american and some regional and in each case highquality operators usually where they to the extent they are regional they have got a great franchise area that is either given to them by regulation or demographics that give them a ton of resiliency and less competition vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler your line is now open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking my question gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey i guess first of all i just want to echo some of the prior comments really good detail and appreciate the disclosure and i think at this point just one small question sort of a followup on the deferrals i guess im just curious on the commercial side and even though its early i was hoping you might be able to give a little insight as to how you would expect sort of the i guess the re duediligence process to go as we come up on the end of the deferral time period and how will that go sort of willingness to defer again or how does that entire process work through james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yeah so on the mortgage are you talking on the consumer side scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co no actually even though its relatively small im actually more curious about the commercial side fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yeah so the commercial side will just continue on a casebycase basis with each client as the covenant relief periods expire as were executing on these covenant waivers we have been adding some additional liquidity capital retention requirements as well so we feel like the process has been productive theres been a good dialogue with clients and so that will just continue over the course of the year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and then at what point do you sort of i mean i guess its all casebycase but at what point do you sort of make the decision as to okay we could continue to sort forbear on this or maybe it needs to be at a downgraded chargeoff et cetera richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah its richard so we review the portfolio actively and for the names that are going to be more impacted at least quarterly but there is active management active dialogue and so as new information comes in we adjust our internal risk ratings and then as we have financial reporting that would be the other driver that would change our view on our risk to the extent that borrowers continue to perform in line with expectations we would expect to continue the deferrals and the forbearance that weve agreed to r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect i appreciate the color so thank you guys again operator there are no question at this time you may now continue chris chris doll senior vice president directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thank you kyle and thank you all for your interest in
