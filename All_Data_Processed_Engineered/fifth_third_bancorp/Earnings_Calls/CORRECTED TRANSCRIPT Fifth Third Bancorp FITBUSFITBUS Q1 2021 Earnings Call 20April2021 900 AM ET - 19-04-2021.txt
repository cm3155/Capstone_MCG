gregory d carmichael chairman chief executive officer president fifth third bancorp thanks chris and thank all of you for joining us this morning hope you are all well and staying healthy earlier today we reported first quarter net income of million or per share we continued our positive momentum from the past several quarters and once again delivered strong financial results in the first quarter these strong results reflect record commercial banking fee revenue continued success generating consumer household growth and a strong underlying net interest margin our performance reflects focused execution on our key strategic priorities we continue to benefit from the diversification and resilience of our feebased businesses in retail mortgage commercial and wealth and asset management which are generating strong results and helping to cushion the impact of lower shortterm rates we have maintained our disciplined client selection and conservative underwriting which are evident in our credit metrics over the quarter we recorded a benefit in our provision for credit losses reflecting a stronger economic outlook as well as historically low net chargeoffs which included improvements in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios in addition to muted credit losses our criticized assets and npls also improved sequentially nonperforming loans decreased from the prior quarter with npl inflows at the lowest level since the third quarter of our balance sheet and earnings power remain very strong as a result our robust cet1 ratio further improved to this quarter our cet1 target remains at as we have stated many times before we are focused on deploying capital for organic growth opportunities evaluating nonbank opportunities where it fits our strategy and share repurchases based on our current dividend and trailing four quarters of net income we have the capacity to repurchase shares up to million in the second quarter after that we have more flexibility in terms of how and when return capital to shareholders under the scb stress capital buffer framework jamie will provide more details on our capital plan the improved macroeconomic data and outlook are aligned with our strongest overall commercial loan production since before the pandemic furthermore we have seen our pipeline strengthen considerably over the past days with significant strength in manufacturing renewables healthcare and technology partially offset by muted demand in leisure and hospitality and cre production was offset by elevated payoffs and paydowns combined with another decline in line utilization we are retaining the customer and their core banking relationship as virtually none of our commercial payoffs during the quarter were the result of client attrition additionally paydowns in our corporate bank largely reflected clients tapping the capital markets where we benefited significantly from additional capital market fees given the strong production trends firming pipeline and retention of the client relationship we remain well positioned to take advantage of a more favorable economic backdrop should clients execute their growth plans in the second half of we will continue to assess the implications of client supply chain constraints as we progress through the year consumer employment savings and spending trends also remained favorable given the fiscal stimulus pentup demand and a gradual reopening of the economy throughout our footprint fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 despite the overall economic recovery over the past several quarters i recognize that not everyone in our society has benefited equally this is why im very proud that in addition to producing strong financial results we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the wellbeing of our communities i am particularly pleased that we exceeded our fiveyear billion commitment to invest in low and moderate income communities by more than billion we also recently announced a billion commitment in support of racial equality focused on lending investing and financial accessibility we also announced a new banking product this quarter called momentum banking which competes with the fintechs and is now our flagship massmarket banking offering momentum banking provides customers with liquidity solutions in our newly enhanced mobile app to help them avoid unnecessary fees including immediate access to funds from digital deposits shortterm ondemand borrowing options simple goalbased savings targets free customer access to their paycheck to two days earlier with a qualifying direct deposit starting in june and no monthly service fees in addition we were honored to once again be named one of the worlds most ethical companies by ethisphere also reflecting our strong corporate culture compliance program and esg actions we were one of just five banks globally to receive this accolade this year we believe our balance sheet strength diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well in and beyond we remain committed to generating sustainable longterm value for shareholders and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top regional bank i would like to once again thank all our employees i am very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers and each other over the past year you have enabled fifth third to continue to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities with that ill turn it over to jamie to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook james c leonard executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp thank you greg and thank all of you for joining us today we generated strong returns this quarter reflecting our solid operating performance and continued improvement in credit quality we produced an adjusted roa of and an rotce excluding aoci of ppnr results were also strong driven by strength in both nii and fees consequently expenses were elevated relative to our previous guidance due to performance and marketlinked compensation expenses we recorded a million release to our credit reserves this quarter which lowered our acl ratio from to our historically low chargeoffs which came in better than expected combined with an improving economic outlook versus previous expectations resulted in a million net benefit to the provision for credit losses continuing with the income statement performance net interest income declined just sequentially due to the lower day count and a reduction in prepayment penalties received in the securities portfolio compared to the fourth quarter this was partially offset by the impact of billion in governmentguaranteed residential fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 mortgage forbearance loans purchased from a thirdparty servicer in december and another million in march we have continued to take action to prudently deploy excess liquidity in order to improve our nii trajectory for and these loans provided a more attractive riskadjusted return relative to other alternatives our first quarter nii results also included approximately million in incremental ppp fees reflecting loan forgiveness compared to the fourth quarter additionally as we discussed previously our prior quarter nii results included prepayment penalty income for our investment portfolio which declined million sequentially from a liability management perspective we reduced our interestbearing core deposit costs another two basis points this quarter resulting in a cost of only basis points reported nim increased basis points sequentially reflecting a decline in excess cash incremental ppp forgiveness fees and day count partially offset by the aforementioned securities prepayment penalty income decline underlying nim excluding ppp and excess cash decreased just basis points to basis points with a top quartile margin relative to peers an assetsensitive balance sheet and over billion in excess liquidity we believe that we remain wellpositioned for a higher rate environment while also benefiting from structural protection against lower rates given our securities and hedge portfolios additionally we have updated our interest rate risk disclosures to reflect a deposit beta to better align with our future expectations based on the last rate hike cycle experience in a plus100 basis point scenario where we invest about onethird of our excess liquidity over a 12month period we would expect annual nii to be about higher compared to a static rate environment total reported noninterest income decreased adjusted noninterest income excluding the tra impact increased compared to the prior quarter our fee performance reflected strength throughout our lines of business including record commercial banking fees led by robust debt capital markets revenue mortgage banking revenue driven by strong production and strong leasing business revenue top line mortgage banking revenue increased million sequentially reflecting improved execution and strong production in both retail and correspondent which was partially offset by incremental margin pressure also as we discussed in january our fourth quarter results included a million headwind from our decision to retain a portion of our retail production mortgage servicing fees of million and msr net valuation gains of million were more than offset by asset decay of million if primary mortgage rates were to move higher we would expect to see some servicing revenue improvement which would likely be more than offset by production and margin pressures in that environment as a result we currently expect fullyear mortgage revenue to decline low to midsingle digits given our rate outlook reported noninterest expenses decreased relative to the fourth quarter adjusted expenses were up driven by seasonal items in the first quarter in addition to elevated compensationrelated expenses linked to strong fee performance as well as the marktomarket impact on nonqualified deferred comp plans current quarter expenses included million in servicing expenses from our purchased loan portfolios for the full year we expect to incur million to million in servicing expenses for purchased loans including the impact of an additional billion in forbearance pool purchases in april fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 moving to the balance sheet total average loans and leases were flat sequentially ci results continued to reflect stronger production levels offset by paydowns additionally revolver utilization rates decreased another this quarter to a record low due to the extraordinary levels of market liquidity and robust capital markets the sequential decline in utilization came primarily from covid highimpact industries and our energy vertical also our leveraged loan outstandings declined more than sequentially as greg mentioned we are encouraged by the fact that we are retaining customer relationships throughout this environment and are benefiting from the fee opportunities average cre loans were flat sequentially with endof period balances up reflecting drawdowns on prior commitments which were paused during the pandemic average total consumer loans were flat sequentially as continued strength in the auto portfolio was offset by declines in home equity credit card and residential mortgage balances auto production in the quarter was strong at billion with an average fico score around with lower advance rates higher internal credit scores and better spreads compared to last year our securities portfolio increased approximately this quarter as we opportunistically preinvested expected second quarter cash flows of approximately billion during march with respect to broader securities portfolio positioning we remain patient but we will continue to be opportunistic as the environment evolves assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook we would expect to increase our cash deployment when investment yields move north of the basis point range we are optimistic that strong economic growth in the second half of will present more attractive riskreturn opportunities we continue to feel very good about our investment portfolio positioning with of the investment portfolio invested in bullet and lockedout cash flows at quarter end our securities portfolio had million of net discount accretion in the first quarter and our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained strong at billion pretax average other shortterm investments which includes interestbearing cash decreased billion sequentially and increased billion compared to the yearago quarter the unprecedented excess cash levels are the result of record deposit growth over the past year core deposits were flat compared to the fourth quarter as growth in consumer transaction deposits impacted by the fiscal stimulus was offset by seasonal declines in commercial transaction deposits and a reduction in consumer cd balances we are experiencing strong deposit growth so far in april and expect low singledigit growth in the second quarter from both consumer and commercial customers moving to credit our overall credit quality continues to reflect our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting prudent management of our balance sheet exposures and the continued improvement of the macroeconomic environment the first quarter net chargeoff ratio of basis points improved basis points sequentially nonperforming assets declined million or with the resulting npa ratio of basis points declining basis points sequentially also our criticized assets declined with considerable improvements in casinos restaurants and leisure travel as well as in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios partially offset by continued pressure in commercial real estate particularly central business district hotels fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes the labor market continues to improve with unemployment reaching by the middle of next year and ending our threeyear rs period in this low range as a result this scenario assumes most of the labor market disruption created by the pandemic and resulting government programs is resolved by but still leaves a persistent employment gap of a few million jobs compared to pre covid expectation additionally our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from the administrations recent fiscal stimulus and assumes an infrastructure package over trillion is passed this year we did not change our scenario weights of to the base and to the upside and downside scenarios applying a probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a million release to our reserve conversely applying to the downside scenario would result in a million build inclusive of the impact of approximately million in remaining discount associated with the mb loan portfolio our acl ratio was additionally excluding the billion in ppp loans with virtually no associated credit reserve the acl ratio would be approximately with the recent economic recovery in our base case expectations point to further improvement there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out given the uncertain environment like all of you we continue to closely watch covid case and vaccination trends which could impact the timing of reopening of local economies and reverse the strengthening consumer confidence trends our march allowance incorporates our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth lower unemployment and improving credit quality including the expected benefits of government programs moving to capital our capital remained strong during the quarter our cet1 ratio grew during the quarter ending at above our stated target of which amounts to approximately billion of excess capital our tangible book value per share excluding aoci is up since the year ago quarter during the quarter we completed million in buybacks which reduced our share count by approximately million shares compared to the fourth quarter as greg mentioned we have the capacity to repurchase up to million in the second quarter based on our current dividend and the federal reserves average trailing four quarters of net income framework as a category four bank we expect to have additional flexibility with respect to capital distribution starting in the third quarter as prudent stewards of capital we expect to get closer to our cet1 target by mid2022 while we did not participate in ccar we are required to submit our boardapproved capital plan to the fed those plans support the potential to raise our dividend in the third quarter and repurchase over million in the second half of moving to our current outlook for the full year we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up a bit compared to last year reflecting relative stability in commercial combined with lowsingle digit growth in consumer which includes the additional billion in ginnie mae forbearance loan purchases in april we continue to expect cre to remain stable in this environment our loan outlook assumes commercial revolver utilization rates migrate closer to by year end it also includes the impact of billion in loan balances we expect to add from the latest round of ppp including the billion weve generated todate which will continue to be offset by forgiveness throughout the year we expect our underlying nim to be in the basis point area for the full year combined with our loan outlook we expect nii to decline just this year assuming stable securities balances on a sequential basis we expect fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 nii to be stable to up within our nii guidance we assume we generate approximately million in ppp related interest income in of which million was realized in the first quarter compared to million in the full year of we expect full year fees to increase to compared to or to excluding the impact of the tra improvement from our previous guide reflects a more robust economic rebound as well as our continued success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities resulting in stronger processing revenue capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue which will be partially offset by mortgage we expect second quarter fees to decline to reflecting lower mortgage and leasing revenues partially offset by lowsingle digit growth in card and processing and treasury management revenue we expect relatively stable commercial banking revenues sequentially given both our stronger fee and nii outlook combined with the servicing costs from the loan portfolio purchases we expect full year expenses to be up driven by volumebased compensation and other expenses on a sequential basis we expect expenses to decline to we expect to generate positive operating leverage in the second half of reflecting our expense actions our continued success growing our feebased businesses and our proactive balance sheet management we expect total net chargeoffs in to be in the 30basispoint to 40basispoint range given the strong first quarter performance and assuming our base case scenario continues to playout second quarter losses are likely to be in the 25basispoint to 35basispoint range in summary our first quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle we will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and a focus on a longterm performance horizon which has served us very well during this environment with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll senior vice president directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp before we start qa as a courtesy to others we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions we will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning operator please open the call for questions fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first response is from bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning i wanted to ask about your investments specifically in the southeast youre obviously managing expenses for the revenue environment but can you talk about the priorities with the investment dollars that you are allocating for the southeast where are those investments being made and have we started to see the returns from those investments come through already in your loan growth nii and fee trends that we saw this quarter just a little bit more color on the return timeline would be helpful gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer president fifth third bancorp fantastic this is greg first of all thanks for the question listen we continue to be bullish on our investments and our strength in our southeast markets to remind you these are markets were already in that we have a presence and its really about being a better provider of products and services in those markets and really taking advantage of the opportunity those markets create for us we couldnt be more pleased todate with the progress weve seen in that market especially if you look at household growth new customer acquisition strength of our commercial businesses in those in the southeast markets so the progress weve made todate were going to continue to invest in those markets as it makes sense from an other investments perspective obviously we balance our investments for the greatest return for our shareholders but right now we think the southeast is still a good place for us to continue to invest until we get to the scale and take advantage of the opportunities that are out there and ill tim you may want to add a few things on progress timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah bill so good question just to add to what greg said when we announced the buildout of the de novo strategy in the markets in the southeast we announced that we were going to build about branches only about of those have come online but those branches collectively are contributing almost of our new household production this year so we are seeing some benefit there but a lot still to come as we add another plus branches in the southeast this year and another next year on the commercial banking and wealth management side of the equation i think weve talked in the past about the additions we have made in the southeast on the fee income side of the business both coker capital and h2c are headquartered down there and have strong southeast presences but we also talked about adding additional middle market bankers to the southeast and only about of those positions were filled in the first quarter with another offers outstanding so very clearly those benefits are not yet in the run rate but weve fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 been very pleased with the quality of talent that we are able to attract and we expect that to continue to further accelerate the shift in the business mix between the midwest and the southeast markets bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you as a followup can you speak to your asset sensitivity and any plans to alter it from here and then maybe just discuss how youre thinking about the potential for layering in any swaps from where we are currently james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah its jamie thanks for the question we did as i said in our prepared remarks update our asset sensitivity disclosures to i think be a little more transparent and give you our views of how we see the next rate hike cycle playing out so we did change our deposit betas from down to so with that in mind obviously that reflects a very assetsensitive balance sheet as you can see in the disclosures how we look at it right now is that given our view on the economy we believe theres still momentum and a bias for higher rates as plays out and even so for us we can afford to be patient and fortunately our investment portfolio is running off at a pretty slow pace and the hedges arent running off at all we still have more years before we have that headwind so were really not forced into trades today that would sacrifice future nii levels just to make income now so i think well continue to be patient well be opportunistic but we would certainly like to see entry points a little bit better and our focus would be more on just extension of protection as opposed to laying on net new notional amounts to where we are today bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thanks jamie thank you all for taking my questions operator thank you your next response is from gerard cassidy of rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning how are you guys gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer president fifth third bancorp good morning gerard james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 jamie can you share with us and maybe greg too we all have seen in the banking industry and you guys certainly are showing it as well this incredible deposit growth year overyear and clearly the quantitative easing from the fed is a major contributor to the industrys deposit growth as well as the deficit spending by the us government obviously youre not a wholesale bank like some of our money center banks that might be gathering some of these deposits from this quantitative easing can you share with us where is the or kind of give us a timeline or a trail of where is this deposit growth coming from in terms of your customer base and whats going to eventually bring it down so that your shortterm investments will eventually be utilized by your customers basically drawing down those deposits james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp thanks gerard great question and a difficult answer but ill start with the easy parts in terms of where our deposit growth has come from were up year over year 30plus billion dollars seventy percent of that has come from our commercial customer base and has come out of the consumer book in terms of the consumer book the growth was really driven as weve talked about the household growth but also just the consumers deleveraging and when you slice the consumer deposit book just march over march average dda and ibts per account are up about savings are up so were seeing that consumer behavior being a little more conservative plus the additional stimulus and all the other liquidity programs available are just adding significant balances to these consumer accounts i think that will come down as consumer spending picks up and we should expect that excess liquidity of about per account start to wane in the back half of this year but for the second quarter we do expect consumer deposit growth to continue weve seen that with the stimulus payments with tax refunds and so we see a portion of that excess liquidity being applied to paying down unsecured loans but for the most part sticking from a commercial perspective i think clients are just being more conservative and i expect the commercial deposit balances perhaps tick down a little bit slower in over a period of years as folks while we see strong pipelines and encouragement for loan growth i think corporations will hold a little bit extra liquidity given what weve just been through and so i think you might see the ability to grow loans without really seeing a lot of runoff in the commercial deposits but i think consumer spending will drive a decline in the consumer book perhaps sooner than commercial gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good i know you gave us some good color jamie on the loan loss reserves relative to loans and credit quality for you and your peers has been extraordinarily good through a cycle that was pretty dramatic as we all know what do you think and i know its a moving target with cecl but what do you think about getting the reserves down to that dayone cecl level in january of what would it take and how long will it take do you think for you guys to bring it down to that level james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp so our dayone reserve was basis points and on an applestoapples basis today fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc right james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp if you exclude ppp lets call it a basis points level gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc right james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp so when you look at our process at the end of each quarter we have a robust process that estimates the allowance based on the credit risk in the portfolio and thats driven by the economic forecast over the threeyear reasonable and supportable horizon that we use so while we feel very positive about our credit performance to date through the pandemic there are still segments of the economy and our loan book that have not returned to those prepandemic levels of health so we do think full normalization will take time and will not occur over a period of just a few quarters and i guess to answer the heart of your question to get back to those adoption level reserve rates we would need to see a sustained strengthening in the credit characteristics of those borrowers that are most at risk for the longerterm negative impacts from the pandemic in concert with improving economic forecast and most importantly those forecasts need to improve above our current expectations so i think it will take some time gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for the answer operator our next response is from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer president fifth third bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc can you size the level of your investments you expect positive operating leverage in the second half of the year this must be taking some sort of a toll and i guess weve heard a lot of investments you have the southeast fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 expansion where youre opening branches thats one category second category would be other expansion markets like texas and california and the third category would be the loan process automation so when you add it all up what sort of impact does this have when do these investments peak if you think of a j curve as investing and hurting your profits then improving later when do you get to that inflection point james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah mike its jamie thanks for the question really when you look at our expense outlook for the year yes we do as you mentioned we do expect the positive operating leverage second half of the year the second quarter of is probably going to be the highest yearoveryear growth rate on expenses and the it investments will be yearoveryear up doubledigits we expect marketing to accelerate in the second quarter and then we have the investments from the loan servicing costs for some of the loan pool purchases so really when we look out at the expense guide each quarter should be better and better in terms of expenses whereas nii grows were at the trough now nii should grow every quarter and then as we talked about before fees from the second quarter trough should then build throughout the rest of the year so thats how we see the year playing out obviously weve got some flexibility to change that expense progression should it not play out and deliver that extra revenue but thats really how we see the year playing out mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just a separate question for the southeast expansion strategy what is the end game in terms of where do you want to be in terms of market share where you are today or other metrics that youre monitoring gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer president fifth third bancorp mike this is greg i mean listen so weve said many times before we like the southeast markets for all the reasons you would expect its also one of our strongest performing the strongest performing sector of our business both on the retail side and on the commercial side and on the wealth side so its really been a strong performance for us so the end game we want to be just call it top five bank in the market from a deposit perspective will be an objective of ours thats pretty much what we search for we think that makes us relevant allows us to serve the community the best so top five retail deposits is how were thinking about it and then from a banker perspective on the commercial side just making sure we have the talent in the market to take advantage of the opportunities down there that are presented to us so thats kind of what were focused on tim anything you want to add to that timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp no i think that thats right were a little bit unique if you look at the southeast footprint and most of the growth in the southeast is happening on the atlantic coast side and the midatlantic and then on both sides in florida and fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 we really have a metro market strategy down there so and the focus is on places like charlotte raleigh durham chapel hill nashville naples tampa the highgrowth midsized markets and as greg said top five in those markets would get you to call it to market share in those stated metro areas as opposed to including the micropolitan markets elsewhere in the state mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator the next response is from ken usdin of jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning just a followup on the ginnie mae and the mortgage banking businesses do you still see room to find and repurchase more of those ginnie mae buyouts and you mentioned on the mortgage side that youre retaining a little bit more of your production can you give us an understanding of how much of that production youre now planning to retain and how much thats changed over time thanks james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp thanks ken in terms of the ginnie mae pools theyre becoming more and more difficult to locate i think as everybodys been executing on that play for their own portfolio and as we talked about we bought back our million in the third quarter of so that combined with the fact that were over billion of product now i think thats a healthy and appropriate allocation for our balance sheet so im not looking to add more there in terms of the mortgage retention we did retain in the fourth quarter billion or so of our retail production this quarter we did not elect to retain anything that was salable so were currently selling everything that is salable and then retaining jumbo nonconforming and other items so i think thats and that for now would be our intention for the rest of this year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and jamie one followup on mortgage you guys have been taking a long a little bit longer to get kind of the pipeline through and we saw the originations up can you just give us an update there on just your outlook for origination volumes and have you kind of gotten that to the right spot in terms of being able to get the production through in terms of that opportunity set thanks james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yes for as disappointing as the fourth quarter was in mortgage the first quarter was just as exciting so we feel very good about how the team performed the first quarter was very strong and weve got the trains running on time and everything is in a good spot as you can tell from the first quarter results so in terms of the outlook for the year we expect the mortgage originations to be up a bit call it midsingle digits second quarter volumes midsingle digits but the headwind is going to be margin compression so while we fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 transition to more of a purchase environment here over the summer months volumes should be strong margins will compress and then as those prepayments refis slow down we expect to see a little bit of a lift in the servicing portfolio so its less of a headwind and perhaps even a positive in the back half of the year but netnet i think on a year overyear basis were looking at a slight decline in both top line and bottom line mortgage fees ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you jamie operator your next response is from ken zerbe of morgan stanley please go ahead ken your line is open ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh i apologize i was on mute in terms of getting to the ce tier target how much of that comes from being at the very high end of your allowable stock buybacks like the million in the back half of the year versus balance sheet growth later in the year james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp the balance sheet growth is fairly stable in terms i guess of the yearoveryear we do have i guess the dynamic of ci growth but ppp paydowns but i dont see the balance sheet at least in being that big of a driver i guess theres a basis points of erosion with the cecl transition that kicks in in the first quarter of but overall our income levels are more than sufficient to cover the balance sheet growth so the real benefit for us is just buying back the million in the second quarter and then million or more in the back half of the year to try to bring that down to by midyear thats our goal and then also have a dividend increase here in the third quarter ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay perfect and then just as a followup in terms of your net charge off guidance think youre at basis points this quarter your guidance for next quarter is sort of call it maybe basis points at the midpoint but your full year guidance is the basis points to basis points are you implying that second half should see noticeably higher chargeoffs or is that just being more conservative james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah i think its an element of conservativism given the uncertainty in the environment we certainly could experience chargeoffs at the very low end of that range but at this point in time feel like its prudent to guide to a 30basispoint to 40basispoint range ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 got it okay thank you operator your next response is from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer president fifth third bancorp hi matt matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so just to ask a liquidity question a little bit different you actually had a more modest increase in both deposits and the cash this quarter than what were seeing for the overall industry and im just wondering how youd reconcile that difference james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp its really driven by our commercial clients and in particular our focus on retailers where you typically have seasonal runoff in the first quarter of every year from elevated fourth quarter balances i think on a yearoveryear basis our growth is certainly at the highend and i think weve done a very nice job of capturing more than our fair share of the excess liquidity in the commercial book and then obviously the household growth on the consumer side has contributed so i feel good about how were positioned from a deposit gathering perspective it is just more about when is the right time to start putting the money to work matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separately the incremental costs related to the mortgage servicing for the loans that youve purchased theres obviously a lot more revenue that youre getting than the million of additional cost but i guess i was a little surprised that theres that much incremental costs that its just not more scalable or is it a bit of a kind of more intensive product to service given the nature of the ginnie maes james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp no a very good question the answer is actually far simpler which is we dont service the loans and therefore we pay a servicing fee and that servicing fee is certainly on the high side given the yield on the securities and so it endsup being almost a servicing fee paid to the servicer but the flip side is you get more than that benefit but it does show up in nii so when you look at our expense guide as diligent as we are and as focused as we are on expenses at the end of the day we did raise the expense guide points half of that is from the volumerelated compensation expense and fee growth and then half is from these additional loan servicing costs that are more than offset by the improvement in nii fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and whats the related pickup in revenue that you get for those loans or the yield if you want to put it in percent james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yes high yield matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp and then theres additional fee income that comes as the loans are resold so all in its an roa of roughly which is very attractive in this environment and certainly better than just buying mbs in the portfolio matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes agreed thank you operator the next response is from scott siefers of piper stander please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question just i guess when we talk about the line utilization improving potentially from up to by the end of the year maybe just a reminder of what you would consider sort of a typical number for you guys and then just as the followup im not sure anyone has a great answer for it but maybe just best guesses or thoughts on why utilization isnt already improving kind of broadly for the industry given that we all have what seems like pretty good visibility into the likely trajectory of the economy vaccination rates et cetera i just would be curious to hear your thoughts there gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer president fifth third bancorp scott good question this is greg ill start it and maybe throw it back over to tim for some more color first off normalized line utilization for us going into the pandemic would have been on average so obviously with the pandemic you saw a spike up to 40plus percent but think about a normalized range were running about right now so hopefully the second half of the year is a little stronger than we anticipate as we look at our bottomsup forecast we can pick up another lift thats a stretch out there but we think thats doable given what were seeing in our pipelines just back up to which is still not the normalized level if you think about it each is about million of outstandings for us so the impact of a uplift by year end is less than on total loan growth for given the rampup throughout the year so its possible but once fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 again i think theres a lot of variables out there that were watching but we are encouraged by the pipeline strength that were seeing right now our production levels in commercial in the first quarter were at prepandemic level so were encouraged by that if you look at the pipelines going forward the forecast right now will be about up in production over but slightly below prepandemic levels and were seeing good strength in manufacturing healthcare tmt and renewables right now and if you look at our markets where were seeing some good progress indiana michigan california and the carolinas would jump out as a source of strength from an asset perspective so production is strong the pipelines look good were hopeful well see in the back half of this year an improvement in line utilization and once again theres a lot of liquidity out there so its something were watching timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp i think just to add to what greg said scott were asking the same question to ourselves in terms of whats the visibility we have into the economy and some of the signals were seeing about a pickup on inflation and input costs i had the chance since the beginning of the year to be out in of our different regions and to spend time with clients there so weve been asking that question and what we are hearing from them primarily are either supply chain disruptions some of that obviously is some of the global dynamics that we have talked about whether it was stuff stuck in the canal or shortages in semiconductors but it also is just access to materials and then on the other side of the equation labor shortages in particular as it relates to the skilled trades and the byproduct of that is were not seeing the inventory building that you might otherwise expect to see yet so were watching inventory levels closely were watching the ifm index closely as leading indicators to when we may see a pickup in utilization i think one positive note which is reflected in the results in the first quarter is we are seeing increased demand on the equipment side of the business and that is encouraging because that obviously would be the other precondition to an expansion r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes all right thats perfect thank you guys very much for the thoughts timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp sure operator thank you and your last question is from erika najarian of bank of america please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer president fifth third bancorp good morning erika fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp hey erika erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc first question is for jamie jamie thank you so much for slide i love it most investors have started to talk about normalized rotces as they think about valuing banks with a two to threeyear forward look and even though you deployed some excess liquidity whats stunning is how significant it still is relative to and as investors contemplate what normalized returns are for fifth third how where do shortterm investments normalize to james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp so your question are you from a total return perspective rotce or are you just asking on what are we how much excess cash do we end up holding erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc yes so do you ever go back to billion or are we redefining james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp okay got it erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc what excess liquid is for your guys james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp sure because obviously we debate daily when is the right time to put the money to work and how do we see the environment playing out right now i think the easiest way to consider the excess liquidity would be a third of it runs off a third of it wed love to invest in organic loan growth and a third of it ultimately gets invested in the investment portfolio and so in terms of what that return profile looks like with regard to the investment portfolio we want to wait for the right time to put the money to work but when we do put it to work were at right now securities as a percent of total assets were comfortable running that number at or so so that means about billion or so of that additional liquidity we would deploy into the investment portfolio over a period of time erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one last question on momentum banking how should we think about how momentum banking can potentially impact longterm consumer deposit growth versus whether or not that renormalizes service charges on deposits lower fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp sure erika its tim a good question so i think we are very focused our strategy as i think weve discussed quite frequently is a primary relationship strategy its a focus on primary banking its a focus on being the place where you get paid on where you pay your bills and on how you build up liquidity and the byproduct of that obviously as jamie mentioned earlier is we did see really positive trends in the consumer side of the business because the liquidity that consumers have built up really is in the transaction accounts as opposed to somewhere else so our deposit growth on the consumer side has been underpinned by call it to household growth over a period of several years now we would like to continue to bump that number up and we think that the momentum banking product coupled with the expansion in the southeast gives us a path to doing that in terms of the overall household growth rates that we experienced which will support noninterestbearing deposit growth i think on the other side of the equation yes when somebody elects to use a shortterm liquidity product take our early access product the deposit advance product that weve had in the market for several years now that is a lower cost way to cover a cash flow shortfall than an overdraft fee but its also a very sustainable way and owing to the fact that we have had those products in our product set for several years now our overdraft charges as a percentage of total consumer deposits are lower than all but one of the large us banks already so i think from our perspective were giving the consumer the widest possible range of options to avoid fees were getting the benefit of that in the form of household growth and of primacy which is the entry point for us to the broadest range of products and services that we offer and because of our position on the overdraft side of the equation and the low reliance on that fee line we have less to give up there and are going to be able to outgrow any sort of an impact on the fees per household measure erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it that was clear thank you operator thank you there are no further responses at this time ill turn the call back over to chris doll chris doll senior vice president directorinvestor relations
