earnings call 20apr2023 timothy n spence president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp thanks chris and good morning everyone thank you for joining us today the past weeks have seen a great deal of volatility in the banking sector markets have been trading on narratives over fundamentals and the term regional bank has been used to describe such a broad crosssection of business models that it has lost any real descriptive value while we at fifth third take any instability in our sector very seriously there was no crisis inside our four walls weve been running the company with the expectation for a higher for longer rate environment for many quarters now as weve consistently communicated in these calls and at investor conferences as our first quarter results demonstrate our balance sheet remains wellfortified and our capacity to generate strong profitability through the cycle is strong excluding items noted in the release we reported earnings per share of a increase compared to the year ago quarter we generated points of yearoveryear positive operating leverage driven by an increase in revenue during the quarter we held average and periodend deposits flat sequentially despite the industrywide impact of quantitative tightening and normal seasonal pressures our key credit metrics remained near historical lows with net chargeoffs of basis points coming in at the low end of our guidance range npas npls and earlystage delinquency ratios remained below normalized levels and criticized assets decreased modestly during the quarter moreover we accomplished all this while also being recognized by ethisphere as one of only two us banks on their worlds most ethical companies list we were named by fortune as one of americas most innovative companies and we saw our fintech platform provide named by fast company as one of the worlds most innovative businesses strong outcomes achieved this quarter and in particular in the month of march highlight the strength granularity and wellbalanced nature of our deposit franchise in the weekend following the failure of silicon valley bank alone we opened more new commercial deposit accounts than we would in a typical month similarly our consumer household growth accelerated after the march turmoil our commercial deposit franchise is led by our peerleading treasury management business where we rank in the top nationally in most major commercial payment types of our commercial deposit balances are attached to relationships that utilize tm services today and the average age of our commercial deposit relationships is years these characteristics contribute strongly to stability regardless of balance size our consumer deposit base is granular with nearly of total consumer deposits fdic insured and is anchored by our flagship mass market momentum banking offering and strong branch presence in the markets we serve annual consumer household growth finished the quarter above led by our southeast markets above during the quarter we opened branches in our southeast markets on top of the added in the past years and we expect to open an additional branches by the end of all said end of period total deposit balances ended the quarter above the level on march looking forward while we face the same headwinds that all banks do from increased deposit competition economic uncertainty and the potential for regulatory change i am confident in fifth thirds ability to achieve top quartile returns through the cycle with a focus on stability profitability and growth fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 our longterm discipline managing interest rate and liquidity risks positions us well to generate differentiated outcomes in a range of economic environment from a credit risk perspective our low cre concentration in commercial and in particular in office cre along with our focus on homeowners in consumer should prove to be significant advantages jamie will provide more information on our forward guidance but the implied profitability and return metrics for our full year expectations are well ahead of our core results considering the uncertain environment we have elected to pause share repurchases for the second quarter and will evaluate resuming them in the second half of the year last but certainly not least i want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication in supporting our customers communities and shareholders your commitment to living our purpose and making sure we do the right thing every day is evident with that ill now hand it over to jamie to provide more details on our financial results and outlook james c leonard executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp thank you tim and thank all of you for joining us today our first quarter results were strong despite the market volatility during the quarter average and period end total deposit balances were flat compared to the prior quarter average core deposits declined in line with our guidance of down we grew loans modestly during the quarter while adding new quality relationships in both commercial and net new households in consumer we achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of in a seasonally challenged quarter which is a 6point improvement compared to the year ago quarter our first quarter core ppnr grew nearly compared to last year reflecting the diversification and growth of our revenue streams combined with disciplined expense management net interest income of approximately billion increased yearoveryear but declined sequentially our sequential nii performance was impacted by our shift to a more defensive balance sheet position given the volatile environment the impact of lower day count and seasonally strong investment portfolio income in the prior quarter fee income exceeded our expectations despite the marketrelated headwinds and we remained disciplined on expenses while continuing to invest in our businesses ppnr was impacted by the expenses associated with higherthanexpected fee income our nim declined basis points for the quarter while interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points to basis points reflecting a cycletodate interestbearing deposit beta of through the first quarter which includes the impact of cds total adjusted noninterest income increased compared to the yearago quarter driven by strength in commercial banking and mortgage fee income which more than offset a decline in deposit service charges due to the elimination of consumer nsf fees last year and the impact of higher earnings credits from higher market rates this year growth in commercial banking fee income was primarily driven by increased loan syndication fixed income sales and trading and ma advisory revenue partially offset by a decline in corporate bond fees the improvement in mortgage revenue was driven by increased servicing fees and lower asset decay fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 adjusted noninterest expense increased compared to the yearago quarter excluding the impact of non qualified deferred compensation expenses from both periods expense growth was elevated due to the dividend finance acquisition in the second quarter of and growth in the provide franchise excluding the fintech growth impacts and the fdic assessment total expenses increased approximately compared to the year ago quarter as discipline throughout the bank combined with automation initiatives were offset by compensation associated with our minimum wage hike higher fee income and higher technology and communications expense reflecting our focus on platform modernization initiatives moving to the balance sheet total average portfolio loans and leases increased sequentially reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios commercial was led by ci where payoffs were muted and production was stable in our regional middle market banking business but down in our corporate bank the subdued production in the corporate bank reflects our focus on optimizing returns on capital in this environment combined with less robust demand compared to a year ago quarter ci loans excluding ppp have increased the periodend commercial revolver utilization rate remained stable compared to last quarter at average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased compared to the prior quarter led by dividend finance while balances from the rest of our consumer captions remained relatively stable average total deposits were flat compared to the prior quarter as increases in cds and interest checking balances were offset by a decline in demand deposits by segment wealth and asset management average balances increased sequentially consumer was stable and commercial modestly declined consistent with normal first quarter seasonality periodend total deposits were also flat compared to the prior quarter notably we have grown deposits since the end of last june compared to a decline for the top banks as shown in the feds h8 data we have included additional materials in our earnings presentation to highlight some of the key attributes of our highquality deposit franchise that may be relevant in this environment moving to credit as tim mentioned credit trends remained healthy and our key credit metrics remained well below normalized levels the ratio of earlystage loan delinquencies to days past due decreased basis points sequentially to basis points and remains below levels the net chargeoff ratio of basis points increased basis points sequentially and was at the low end of our guidance range the npa ratio of basis points was up basis points compared to a year ago from a credit management perspective we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on highquality relationships in consumer we have focused on lending to homeowners which are of our consumer portfolio we have also maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in nonprime consumer borrowers among our peers in commercial we have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in cre at of total loans across all commercial portfolios we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress and continue to closely watch the leveraged loan portfolio and office cre office loans of billion represented just of total loans with a criticized ratio of and only basis point of delinquencies while the leveraged loan portfolio has declined since and is now less than billion fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 outstanding today we have focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong stable results through the cycle moving to the acl our reserve change this quarter was a net increase of million or a build of million excluding the onetime impact of adopting the accounting standard eliminating tdr accounting which reduced the reserve by million our build primarily reflected loan growth notably from dividend finance loans which contributed million of the increase the acl ratio increased basis point sequentially or basis points excluding the accounting change as you know we incorporate moodys macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance the base economic scenario from moodys assumes the unemployment rate reaches while the downside scenario underlying our allowance coverage incorporates a peak unemployment rate of we maintained our scenario weightings of to the base and to each of the upside and downside scenarios moving to capital our cet1 ratio remained relatively stable compared to last quarter ending the first quarter at our capital position reflects our strong earnings generation offset by the impacts of returning capital in the form of dividends and repurchases riskweighted asset growth primarily in consumer loans and a basis point decline from the cecl phasein our tangible book value per share increased sequentially partially impacted by our aoci position which improved tangible book value grew excluding aoci compared to the year ago quarter moving to our current outlook we expect full year average total loan growth between and which reflects our cautious outlook on the economic environment we expect total commercial loans to increase in the low to midsingle digits area compared to which implies modest incremental growth from the first quarter through yearend given our outlook for a tempered lending environment in the second half of the year we expect line utilization rates to remain stable we expect total consumer loan growth to also be modest as a strong increase from dividend finance will be mostly offset by a decline in auto and mortgage we continue to expect approximately billion in dividend loan production for the year given the secular tailwinds and our investments in the business combined with market share gains we expect deposits to be stable or grow from the first quarter average level as we progress throughout consistent with our strong customer acquisition trends within that we expect continued migration from dda into interestbearing products throughout the remainder of with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits declining from today to by yearend for the second quarter of we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up sequentially with growth fairly balanced between commercial and consumer portfolios we expect average deposits to also be stable to up on a sequential basis shifting to the income statement we expect full year nii will increase to as other banks have noted industrywide deposit pricing pressures intensified in the wake of the silicon valley and signature bank failures therefore as shown in our presentation materials we are providing nii guidance under a range of deposit betas given potential diverging levels of intensity with respect to deposit competition going forward the upper end of our nii guidance assumes an approximate terminal beta of and the lower end assumes approximately a terminal beta compared to our january expectation of the midpoint of our nii outlook translates to a beta with total interestbearing deposit costs increasing basis points or so in the second quarter and another basis points in the second half of the year fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 our outlook also considers the lag effects from previous rate hikes and continued dda migration and assumes the fed hikes basis points in may and then holds shortterm rates of basis points for the remainder of the year our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances decline a couple of billion dollars between now and yearend and that we hold closer to billion in excess cash for most of the year assuming we continue to defensively position the balance sheet for the remainder of the year by maintaining an elevated excess cash position combined with continued intense deposit competition we are assuming nim will be in the to range for the year we expect second quarter nii to be down approximately sequentially reflecting the deposit loan and cash dynamics i mentioned we expect adjusted noninterest income to be stable to up in reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities resulting in stronger gross treasury management revenue capital markets fees wealth and asset management revenue and mortgage servicing to be partially offset by higher earnings credit rates on tm subdued lease remarketing revenue and a reduction in other fees reflecting lower tra and private equity income this year we expect our fourth quarter tra revenue to decline from million in to million in we expect second quarter adjusted noninterest income to be up to compared to the first quarter we expect to continue generating strong revenue across most fee captions and that will be partially offset by a slowdown in debt capital markets revenue we continue to expect full year adjusted noninterest expenses to be up to compared to our expense outlook incorporates the fdic insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on january the marktomarket impact on nonqualified deferred compensation plans which was a reduction in expenses and the full year impact of investments to grow the dividend finance and provide businesses excluding the dividend acquisition fdic assessment and nqdc impacts we would expect our full year core expenses to be up less than our guidance reflects continued investment in our digital transformation which should result in technology expense growth in the low double digits for the year we also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid to highsingle digits area our guidance also factors the run rate benefits from the severance expense recognized in the first quarter which reflected proactive actions taken to reduce ongoing expenses given the operating environment we expect second quarter adjusted noninterest expenses to decrease to compared to the first quarter in total our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of to resulting in ppnr growth in the to range this would result in an efficiency ratio below for the full year we expect second quarter ppnr to increase to compared to the first quarter and for second quarter efficiency ratio to be around we continue to expect second quarter and full year net chargeoffs to be in the to basis points range given our expected periodend loan growth including continued strong production from dividend finance we continue to expect a quarterly build to the acl of approximately million assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios in summary with our strong ppnr growth engine disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle we believe we are wellpositioned to continue to generate long term sustainable value for customers communities employees and shareholders with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 chris doll senior vice president headinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks jamie before we start qa given the time we have this morning we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions operator please open the call up for q a question and answer section operator the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions our first question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler please proceed r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you for taking the question lets see tim you had talked about the much higher than typical commercial account openings during all the turmoil can you talk about sort of early read on what has happened with those and sort of generally speaking how youd expect commercial customers to behave going forward whether theyll keep the same amount with their primary institution or diversify sort of permanently how would that all work in your mind timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yes so good morning scott thanks for the question just a note for everybody we know you have a busy day here so with the exception of the soliloquy that jamie has prepared on regulation going forward were going to try to keep our answers pretty crisp we were delighted to see the activity obviously and to see that continue to carry forward through the end of the quarter all but literally its singledigits you could count on i think one hand and two fingers the number of the accounts that we opened that didnt fund up between that weekend immediately following silicon valley and the end of the quarter so very pleased with the activity level there i think in terms of account behavior going forward i think were going to see a much more prominent bifurcation and behavior between operational accounts and nonoperational accounts right in effect on the corporate treasurer side cash as an investment versus cash as a tool in terms of the way that you manage the business and that is reflected in the operational account behavior that we saw during the period and i think probably contributed very significantly to the stability that fifth third experienced in terms of commercial account balances but jamie you have anything you want to add james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah and scott what we also saw in the first quarter was that clients were focused on getting money to the best vehicle possible so for us during the quarter we moved almost billion more into the money market portal that we manage for them and even with that incremental movement we were only down about billion in commercial in a seasonally challenged quarter when last year we were down billion in the quarter seasonally and the year before that we were down billion fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 so to tims point the money has been moving to the optimal investment vehicles but the good news for us is we were able to overcome that headwind and actually posted a very solid commercial deposit quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you and then jamie maybe additional color on you gave the thoughts on noninterest bearing the total deposits sort of that goforward mix or end of year mix what in your thinking makes that the right number why not lower or why not higher whats sort of the inside baseball on that james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah the last tightening cycle we moved down points this time were forecasting to go down to finish the year at a dda to core deposit level given that our rate outlook now has the and a longer hold with no cut we think well see continued migration and higher earnings credit rates that will result in more dda migration and then the challenge over time is can you sell enough treasury management services to rebuild that dda balance and given our strong treasury management business we feel confident in our ability to do it so hopefully we do bottom out at but for every more than that it translates to million to million of nii erosion so its while not tremendous impact we would still want to ensure that we get that higher as we head into r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you everyone james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please proceed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi tim hi jamie timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp morning james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 jamie you touched on the credit and how strong it is particularly in the commercial real estate office i think when you guys look at the ci portfolio is there anything on the horizon whether its i know you leveraged loan balances as you pointed out are down dramatically from what are you guys seeing or sensing in the ci portfolio not cre james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yes on ci that was the driver of the npa increase this quarter so on the surface npas were up basis points the sector that drove it the most within ci would be restaurants entertainment as well as professional services but with that said the delinquency levels in commercial and certainly in ci continue to be benign and tim and i were looking back at where we were on npas in the fourth quarter of we were at basis points versus the that were at today and if you look at the 10year average for us were at a basis point average so while were up at basis points sequentially its really more of a normalization and were still or so below a normal run rate when it comes to commercial npas so its really normalization within some of these sectors and for us at least right now its entertainment and professional services timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yes if i just add one thing on that gerard scale is going to matter in terms of the clients that you bank in ci because if you think about the dynamics that are creating headwinds for the economy theyre related to your ability to manage input costs or production and ultimately right the higher cost of carrying inventory to offset concerns around supply chain resiliency on an ongoing basis so when you the sense you get i do when im out talking with clients is the manufacturing businesses and the businesses attached to the resurgence of manufacturing in the us are doing really really well the businesses that are attached to more discretionary spending the larger clients have been able to pass input cost increases higher cost of labor through the smaller ones are having a more difficult time and i think the arm wrestling were seeing going on right now as an example between the notforprofit hospitals and the health care insurance companies is a really good example of where the larger notforprofits are having an easier go of extracting concessions to cover increases in nursing costs and otherwise and the smaller ones its been more of a standoff gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup question jamie in the outlook on net interest revenue obviously you guys guided down a little bit but if youve had to paint two scenarios one is the bullish scenario what would rates have to do where you could actually see maybe deposit betas stall out faster or net interest revenue picks up and then whats the more cautionary view is it higher rate not the frozen rate of but we get to or something like that on fed funds rates in the first quarter of can you give us those two variables james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah i would say that on the positive side of net interest income if the industry and the competitive dynamics settle down over the next couple of months couple of quarters then we would expect that we would operate in that low to mid beta and that would deliver the higher end of our nii guide were a little cautious though in what were seeing from a competitive standpoint as banks are clearly focused on driving more insured retail deposit growth and therefore the retail beta is the wildcard in our guide and why we show the range of deposit fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 betas that could play out and therefore the range of the nii guide is a little wider than what we normally would do just given the uncertainty with how competition will react so in the nearterm that is the wildcard that perhaps retail deposit betas which have been very well behaved actually double by the end of the year and that would take us to the low end of the guide i think longer term when it comes to rates progressing beyond it really comes down to what are the credit implications as the fed reaches an even higher level we think the magnitude of the rate increases have certainly created some shock across the country and you saw that obviously in what were calling the march madness but i think from an nii perspective those higher rates could continue to be productive as long as the deposit beta dynamics stay in the range but if competition heats up and we get into a plus beta environment that would be unproductive to nii gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin from jefferies please proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys good morning as you think further out i know jamie you had talked about that trying to channel that downside nim obviously the rate environment has changed and all the points about the mix and the deposit growth have as well but in terms of just how you expect the balance sheet mix to change over time given that youre running down the securities book and your points about the dda mix how do you just think about that nim protection angle and does it make you think any differently about the way youve built the swaps portfolio and protecting that thanks james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah we feel very good about how the balance sheet is positioned especially for a downgrade environment obviously the swaps were very pleased with the entry points there weve talked at length about in therell be a nice increase to nii as the new swaps kick in in terms of the investment portfolio positioning well have a bit of a decline in the second quarter as we dont reinvest cash flows but from there it should be relatively stable we may continue to reposition nonhqla into level but ultimately that will be regulatory dependent but overall feel good about the bullet lockedout nature the structure that we have so i think for us its going to be more of operating in a high loantodeposit ratio and continuing to maintain that while being very disciplined on credit which is why the loan growth guide was trimmed a bit to that up to level ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and then on the same point about that deposit repricing if and when the fed does cut and obviously a lot of banks are guiding with the curve right now how does your models work in terms of timing of fed cuts versus your ability to then change the direction of deposit pricing fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yes i mean in general its going to be its a balance of nature of when cuts actually occur if were in a liquidity environment where things still are relatively tight the fed has gotten inflation under control but theres not a big credit event obviously the measured cuts would be one where youre going to have a little bit more challenging time reversing all the beta youre still going to get some of the beta out but in the scenario where the fed is having to loosen liquidity conditions pretty rapidly youre going to have an opportunity to get a little bit more aggressive on your rate cuts from there and get some more of that beta out so it really is going to be a little bit of a balance of how things play out weve spent a lot of time positioning the commercial book in particular to make sure that we stay with the appropriate amount of price sensitivity there so that we can reprice down as necessary were up to about billion of index deposits so were taking a lot of actions to make sure that were wellpositioned whether they stay high or if they cut that weve got the flexibility to navigate through those different environments ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian from ubs please proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question is on the potential coming regulatory environment and jamie you probably need something stronger than coffee for this question but the first is on cet1 you generated basis points of capital organically this quarter and im wondering as there is no npr yet but the market is anticipating tighter capital liquidity standards tim how do you think about the endpoint of capital for an institution like fifth third from this and how should we think about what that sort of endpoint is over the medium term and the role of share repurchases potentially more rwa optimization timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp sure im going to let jamie start on that one erika and then ill follow fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp so from a shortterm perspective obviously pausing the buybacks and given the second quarter guide we would expect to your point that we would continue to generate call it basis points of capital even with some rwa growth in the second quarter i do believe that it will be dependent on what the regulations ultimately come out with in order to then answer the medium term part of your question because if i were king for a day i would not change the aoci optout rules because this was not a capital crisis i think the capital regime works as stated but should they decide either to eliminate heldtomaturity and force everybody into afs and then force afs into an aoci mark for us the core earnings capacity of the company along with we included in the deck additional capital accretion measures that we would improve the aoci levels by by the end of next year that it would be a manageable item for us we just dont believe its necessary we have a balance sheet that our target capital level is all stress testing says is great but in this environment were going to accrete capital here in the shortterm and well get to and hopefully have a little more clarity for everybody next quarter timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah and i think just to add two thoughts our capital stress testing indicates you could run the bank at below which is the reason that hasnt been the binding constraint for us we just elect to do it at the level we do because we like stability right and i think we were clear with everybody when we reset the capital target last year we did it because we were concerned about uncertainty in the outlook and we felt that it was prudent to start building capital early as opposed to having to do it later so i am pleased with our positioning i think more broadly one caution i would give everybody is i think some will take the discussion about change in regulation on capital liquidity and just bake it into models without assuming that theres any sort of evolution in the business model the fdic has been publishing quarterly data on the sector i think since at least the data set goes back that far and theres been more than one regulatory regime change during that period and if you adjust for tax the tax policy at a given point in time the return levels in the sector have been remarkably consistent so to the extent that more banks are required to hold more capital or more liquidity or to change the structure of funding i think its reasonable to expect that the business model is going to evolve as well erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it its amazing how resilient banks can be when theres some level to reach right and just a followup question to that fifth third this management team is sort of well known for being more forward thinking whether its your balance sheet resilience to whats been happening in the rate environment or that acl ratio and as we think about like you mentioned tim sort of the market trying to force the regional banks into a tighter regime in terms of how theyre valuing the stocks versus what we know to be what tends to be a very slow regulatory process in terms of npr comment period phasein how do you balance that sort of market demand for higher capital and tlaceligible debt greater cash liquidity versus the regulatory timeline and that we dont know nothing concrete today timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yes i mean i think the answer is the way that you manage that proactively is you would have started doing something on each of those topics last year right so we were in the market after every earnings call last year fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 four times and as a result have the lowest incremental need in the event that tlac had no phasein period right as an example you were deliberate about the way that you managed the acl to reflect uncertainty in the forward outlook and therefore youre carrying good coverage today right which we certainly feel we are and you would have allowed yourself to accrete capital during a period when the market was certainly more robust for regional banks which i think of course we did as well i think lastly what were going to see here coming out of this even if there is no change in regulation is we all will flow the empirical data from march madness through our models and its going to dictate a very different value for nonoperational money and operational money right and the byproduct of that is that the banks that have good core retail deposit franchises and who have good operational commercial franchises so linked to payment activity treasury management services and otherwise that is going to be the place that you want to be because we think the fed obviously has to roll in at some point rates are going to stay higher than zero on an absolute basis and our ability to make money on both sides of the balance sheet is going to be a big driver of who does well if there is more capital requirement or liquidity requirements are higher erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities please proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc you said you expect deposits to be stable or increase from here but for nii to go down in the second quarter did i get that correctly james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yes sir mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and if so why james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 so the driver on nii is really twofold one is the dda mix into interestbearing and then the second element of the guide is that the movement up in rates in march to have a full quarter effect of that rate increase will bleed through into the second quarter and then that will be offset by some benefits from day count as well as some of the consumer loan growth mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and how are you or are you becoming more cautious firmwide and why so you trimmed your loan growth guidance down by and in terms of maybe expenses are you ratcheting that back some are you preparing for tougher times or are you preserving the infrastructure for the potential for growth that maybe others dont expect timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yes so i mean you know us mike we like to try to toe the line were an and company more than we are an or company so theres no question that i think we all feel more cautious about the prospect for loan growth part of that is the feds been abundantly clear theyre going to tamp down demand right no matter what it takes but id note that the decline for us comes on top of what i think was already the lowest full year loan growth guide so we have been pretty cautious as it related to loan growth and in terms of expenses i think you noted the actions we took during the quarter we continue to be surgical about pruning the branch network which creates the capacity to invest in the southeast we had little north of million in severance that rolled through attached to expense actions that were designed to take capacity out of businesses that we just dont believe were going to need it given the outlook and i think the discipline that we have had which is we believe in selffunding investments because it drives good discipline around capital allocation and effort is going to be the same here so we do not intend to pause the strategic investments were making in the southeast or the investments were making in the technology platform those are going to be too valuable for the franchise in the longterm but we are not going to be spending money on a discretionary basis that we dont think is going to generate a nearterm return outside of our strategic investments mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last one it was interesting as you talked about you said you could go ahead and recognize your security losses in afs would be manageable and or i guess you could sell those or do all sorts of things with that do you have the capacity i guess how much more in tlac would you need you said youve been in the market for the last four quarters and if you had to go ahead and do that be the only bank that did that would that set you apart or would that just be uneconomic james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yes just to clarify on the afs my comment was about the aoci should it be a capital requirement that we would have significant improvement based on the implied forward curve through the end of about of that would roll down the curve given the bullet structure of the portfolio not necessarily selling it all so we do like the portfolio but in terms of the tlac challenge at the end of the year our gap to the rwa bank level would be about billion so for a bank our size that is certainly manageable and then the question then becomes what would the fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 regulations change with what you would do with the proceeds so right now were sitting on billion of excess cash which is frankly the biggest driver of the nim erosion as we look forward on a full year basis because that billion of excess cash cost about basis points of nim and so if we were to issue billion more in debt obviously we would prefer to lend it to customers but if the liquidity rules tighten and we have to hold a higher reg yy liquidity buffer then we would be forced and either just holding it in cash or buying more level and so it starts to become a challenge with the distribution of the proceeds when you say would it sets you apart and would your earnings profile improve i think it would just be a grossup of the balance sheet and really not productive and so thats why we havent done it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc no thats clear and lastly billion gap for tlac how much have you issued or how much do you have james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp we havent issued any this year but total longterm debt is billion right now mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah and mike this is bryan thats about of the assets precovid we were at of total assets and that gap is about billion so were just getting back to levels where we were before covid so that tlac requirement is just not a big deal for us relative to our historic balance sheet structure mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great all right thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore please proceed john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 just a question on the securities book i appreciate the detail you gave on slide on the commercial mortgage backed securities i know theyre of your securities book could you maybe give us an update there are you seeing any stress there in terms of performance of those securities amid the commercial real estate stress and then what type of stress would be needed to pose risk to valuations or other than temporary impairment in that portfolio thanks bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely its bryan again so you need to break the cmbs portfolio into two components the agency portfolio which is it is fannie freddie and ginnie guaranteed so that portfolio looks just like rmbs that many people are invested in so from a credit perspective no issues on billion of that portfolio as its gse guaranteed the nonagency portfolio which is only billion it is all super senior aaa rated and we perform a very significant analysis from a stress perspective and from an underwriting perspective every time that we buy and as well as when we monitor the portfolio to give you some color on our recent stress test that weve performed we assume a decrease in property values across all the underlying properties within these structures and even in that scenario we would realize no losses on that portfolio and still have hard enhancement the office loans within that portfolio are about of the underlying loans if we assume that from a weighted average perspective that does office loans that the underlying properties would experience a decrease thats when we would get to our first dollar of credit loss on that portfolio so we feel very confident and there would be significant loan losses across the entire industry before wed even recognize our first dollar loss on the structure associated in this portfolio john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thank you thats very helpful and then separately i just wanted to see if you can update us on the status of your core systems conversion did the march madness at all impact the progression of the conversion or the timing of the expected conversion and then lastly can you maybe help us with the sizing up of the cost of the conversion and how much is expected to be capitalized james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah john its jamie thanks for the question as you saw in the expense numbers this quarter we did have continued rampup in technology costs that ultimately is a good thing because it means were getting things accomplished and we continue to track on all of our deadlines for this year we have new ledger going in in the third quarter followed by a cd platform as well as continued rollout of the ncino platform across the commercial business and then were really at this point about halfway through the game because has additional deadlines associated with it on atm and tm billing as well as the core checking conversion but so far so good we do capitalize and follow the appropriate accounting standards on the total spend here i think the spend over a multiyear period could reach as much as million of which well less than half would be capitalized and from there i think you just continue to see us invest in cloud core technology and thats part of whats driving that expense growth youre seeing both in the first quarter and for the year fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thank you jamie very helpful operator our next question comes from the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley please proceed manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i was wondering if you can give us some more color on why you expect deposits to grow as we get into the remainder of the year what are you seeing in your underlying account openings and conversations with clients that gives you a confidence in that outcome i guess my question is why shouldnt some of these new deposits just go back to the banks where they have longer relationships once the volatility in the system settles down timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah good question so i dont think we took a lot of deposit share from banks that were nonoperational in nature the new accounts that we opened manan were linked to treasury management sales and inclusive of our embedded banking business and were had been on the sales pipeline in some cases for as long as months and there had been technology work that ended up getting accelerated in a handful of other places like we do a very good business with payroll processors we were a net beneficiary of folks who needed the payments infrastructure that fifth third provides and those relationships which were not on the sales pipeline previously moved and because theyre embedded in the daytoday operations of the business they tend to be very sticky i mean look you kind of have to go back to first principles for us on the deposits to say why do we believe that we can continue to be stable or to generate a little bit of growth so a big part of the growth that were generating on the retail side is coming out of that sort of sustained primary household growth that weve been able to generate weve run in the to range for several years now we breached in the first quarter we were running faster than that and that is led by the southeast markets where i think the yearoveryear growth rate was like so very significant there in addition to that the branches weve added in the southeast are driving really really strong growth so if you look at the southeast overall samestore sales and deposits were plus yearoveryear for the quarter if you include the de novos the markets like north and south carolina georgia and florida in totality grew year overyear and if you just annualize the first quarter over the fourth quarter they grew in terms of deposits so really strong production coming from those investments and then i think weve talked a lot about the treasury management business but that on the commercial side of the equation continues to be the thing that is the driver we have a disclosure in one of the slides here on the percentage of commercial relationships that are linked to treasury management its about if memory serves maybe slide and then the length of the balance weighted average relationship tenure in commercial is years so were not talking about people who were parking money here because we were a rate payer i think we have only about billion in total in all deposits in the bank that are priced ahead of fed funds and its reasonable to assume that whether its because the fed raises or because we take other actions that that number is going to be zero by the end of june so we just have a very stable deposit base fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 the growth is coming from investments that are multiyear in nature and that are proven in terms of their ability to support the company and very little deposit gathering activity that would have been uneconomic relative to alternative funding sources less than the billion i believe in total manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it very helpful and then maybe as a followup and maybe the response to this is the same but as i look at the deposit beta assumptions on slide they look pretty conservative relative to the rest of the street but if i look at the slope of that line it is flattening as we look into the forecast period so why shouldnt we expect the same rate of change that weve seen more recently james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah our base view as i said in our prepared remarks or the midpoint of our guide is a beta and that is really driven by our assumption that the battle for retail deposits continues to be very competitive and that that retail beta actually doubles over the course of the year if that were to not happen then we would be at the low end so on the commercial and wealth and asset management side the betas have been running to and those betas will flatten out as the fed stops hiking so part of whats assumed in the slide is that the fed gets to and stops and so that would have a flattening effect and the reality here is that theres a lot of uncertainty as to how competition is going to behave over the next several quarters and you can see on the slide thus far weve done well versus the industry from a deposit beta standpoint but we definitely want to defend our book as well as continue to have strong new customer acquisition manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just two quick followups one on credit i think jamie you mentioned about base case unemployment give us a sense of just sensitivity if that were to be what does that mean for your allowance or for the consumer allowance fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah the acl would go up million for every assuming all other assumptions stay as is ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc okay helpful and another quick followup on going back to tim on your comments around capital and given just the uncertainty around regulations macro economy the cet1 like should we anticipate that drifts higher at least for the next few quarters until theres more visibility or do you expect to be more proactive and return back to sort of buybacks in the back half of the year timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah i think just given the guidance that we provided if you assume no buybacks in the second quarter which is right it would imply we get to by june ebrahim jamie and i both feel confident we could run the business at it just feels prudent at this point in time to make sure that the environment does fully settle out before we resume repurchases ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and just on the environment i think last quarter you talked about things worsening maybe back half of this year into do you have any better visibility in terms of just the shape of the credit cycle how deep it could be and just when we begin to actually see the first sort of deterioration show up in the numbers on credit metrics timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp we continue to think the back half of this year to the beginning of next is probably the right period i think we have been operating under the belief that some of the rosier data that came out in the winter was a little bit of a head fake because you had unseasonably good weather and the byproduct of that was you had spending and a variety of other indicators flash more positive than i think people had anticipated and in part thats why you saw the fed rampup rhetoric again the ism indices are from my point of view the best thing to watch here they certainly are in our footprint and they all are signaling a slowdown and in fact the fed is not going to be able to relent and get inflation under control just based on what we hear from clients without sticking at a 5plus level for some extended period of time and when that happens thats very restrictive right things are going to break my own view is that this is were likely to return to a period that where theres more regional divergence than youve seen in the most recent two cycles i am very happy to be a midwest and southeast bank is a moment like the data thats come out of the census bureau on spending on factories right we had billion in spending on factories last year which was an alltime record financial times did nice work on commitments that have been made theres more than billion in capital commitments this is all stuff thats tied to the trillion that the government intends to invest in rebuilding supply chains here in the us and if you just look at the manufacturing jobs that were added last year like there were manufacturing jobs added in the us compared to i think in as an example and of those were in our footprint so the markets that are going to benefit from the governments investment in infrastructure and domestic supply fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 chain and that sort of broader trend in reshoring are going to do better than markets that were more reliant on technology and professional services or that have more profound challenges as it relates to state budget deficits or challenged city centers there just is going to be a divergence that materializes there so i at least think you should be more focused on regional economic data than on the economy overall as you think about where losses may materialize ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats great color thanks tim operator our final question comes from the line of christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott please proceed christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks for taking my question tim just wanted to ask about dividend finance kind of skewing the loan growth this year maybe in a positive way to where the loan growth exdividend is very conservative is that a fair way of thinking it through timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah yes the two areas of the portfolio where there is any material loan growth this year chris are the dividend finance portfolio as we see the benefit of the balances rolling on because we are portfolioing their production they were originated to sell before we bought them and then in ci which is really a good core steady production in the middle market where in part because of the dynamics around manufacturing youre seeing really solid production out of our legacy markets in the midwest and the continued growth in provide right which is of course linked to healthcare and primarily nonelective dental and vet christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it and the rest is just rolling off and not trying to timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah its quite stable or in modest decline christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it very well
