executive officer fifth third bancorp thanks chris and thank all of you for joining us this morning earlier today we reported second quarter net income of million or per share on adjusted basis we earned per share once again our financial results were very strong continuing the positive momentum from the past several quarters during the quarter we generated sequential ppnr growth of on an adjusted basis the growth was compared to the yearago quarter commercial loan production increased from last quarter with strength in middle market across our footprint as well as in corporate banking we generated strong consumer household growth of compared to last year and we also experienced historically low net chargeoffs of basis points reflecting improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios we generated an adjusted rotce of nearly for the second consecutive quarter reflecting strong business and credit results across the franchise our results were supported by our continued improvement in our diversified businesses in fact we achieved record results in several of our feebased businesses including commercial banking and wealth and asset management despite continued pressure from low interest rates net interest income increased sequentially and the underlying nim increased basis points we believe that our disciplined approach to managing the balance sheet including in our securities and hedge portfolios will continue to generate differentiated performance relative to peers fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 we also continue to maintain our expense discipline while still investing for longterm outperformance as a result of our strong revenue growth combined with our expense management we generated positive operating leverage on a yearoveryear basis with an adjusted efficiency ratio of we are prioritizing investments that drive further operational efficiencies to improve our resiliency generate household growth and improve the customer experience to that end we recently announced an expanded partnership with fis to modernize our core deposit and wealth systems to the cloud which will enable us to further our digital transformation this will significantly improve the flexibility and scalability of our technology infrastructure and accelerate our speed to market combining this agreement with the renegotiation of our existing payment processing relationship allows us to modernize our platforms while maintaining an efficient overall cost structure from a commercial standpoint loan production this quarter was the highest since before the pandemic with significant sequential improvements in technology renewable energy and manufacturing however our strong production was once again offset by elevated paydowns and ppp forgiveness while we continue to retain the customer in their core banking relationship loan growth remains muted due to the environment our commercial lending production trends pipelines and retention of the client relationship all continue to support the potential for improved loan growth once supply and labor constraints normalize we currently expect our commercial revolver utilization rate to increase by yearend on the consumer side as i mentioned we once again generated robust household growth this strong performance reflects our ability to acquire new customers combined with low attrition both of which were supported by our branch and digital investments our recent southeast de novo branches have helped contribute to our household growth on the digital side we continue to leverage technology and data analytics to deliver solutions that improve the customer experience increase revenue and drive efficiencies we have recently launched fifth third momentum banking across our footprint a banking value proposition unparalleled in our industry momentum combines the best of a traditional bank offering with several leading fintech capabilities including early pay which gives customers free access to their paycheck up to two days early extra time which allows customers to cure an overdraft until midnight the following business day without a fee myadvance which gives customers shortterm ondemand liquidity advances smart savings and other features all provided with no monthly fee our strategy to keep the customer at the center has significantly reduced our reliance on punitive consumer deposit fees including overdrafts and atm fees where fifth third has been among the lowest compared to peers for several years fifth third momentum banking accelerates our efforts to help customers avoid unnecessary fees as i mentioned during the quarter we recorded a net benefit to credit losses reflecting historically low net charge offs combined with a stronger economic outlook our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs in addition to historically low credit losses our criticized assets and npas once again improved this quarter criticized assets declined another and our npa ratio declined basis points sequentially our balance sheet and earnings power remained very strong our cet1 ratio of was relatively stable compared to last quarter despite share repurchases of million in the second quarter as we have said fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 before we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities dividend increases and share repurchases additionally our capital position and earnings capacity support an increase in our common dividend starting in the third quarter we currently expect to request a increase to our quarterly dividend in september subject to board approval and economic conditions we also expect to execute share repurchases totaling approximately million in the second half of and continue to target a cet1 by june we recently announced the strategic acquisition of provide a fintech healthcare practice finance firm provide focuses on the dental veterinary and vision segments and delivers digital capabilities which support a bestin class experience and speed to close provide previously utilized an originatetosell model as a result the closing of the acquisition will not include a transfer of loan balances however post close fifth third will retain all loan originations we currently hold around million in loans generated by provide and have noncredit relationships with over of these borrowers through deposits andor treasury management products the acquisition is expected to close in early august and will utilize approximately basis points of capital in summary we believe our balance sheet strength diversified revenues and continued focus on discipline throughout the company will serve us well this year and beyond we remain committed to generate sustainable longterm value and consistently producing topquartile results i would once again like to thank our employees im very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers our commitment to generate sustainable value for stakeholders is evident in our second annual esg report published in june this expands on last years report with increased transparency including enhanced disclosures on priority topics such as inclusion and diversity our climate strategy and our commitment to fair and responsible banking we remain guided by our purpose vision and core values and expect to continue delivering strong results over the longterm with that ill turn it over to jamie to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook james c leonard chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thank you greg and thank all of you for joining us today we are very pleased with the financial results this quarter reflecting focused execution throughout the bank our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit the reported results for the quarter included a million reduction in fee income for the negative mark related to the visa total return swap our improved business performance throughout the bank resulted in strong return metrics we produced an adjusted roa of and an adjusted rotce excluding aoci of our adjusted earnings per share were a record for the bancorp we generated healthy ppnr results the strongest since before the pandemic with net interest income growing sequentially continued success growing and diversifying noninterest income and diligent expense management improvements in credit quality this quarter resulted in a million release to our credit reserves resulting in an acl ratio of basis points compared to basis points last quarter with historically low chargeoffs of just basis points this quarter and an improved economic outlook we recorded a million net benefit to the provision for credit losses fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 moving to the income statement net interest income increased million sequentially reflecting our ability to effectively manage the balance sheet despite the environmental headwinds from low interest rates and elevated paydowns given capital market conditions our nii growth was driven by average loan growth of and million of incremental prepayment penalty benefits from our bullet and lockedout cash flow strategy in our investment portfolio which that position remains on at quarterend our loan balances benefited from the additional billion of ginnie mae forbearance loan buyout purchases in early april bringing the total thirdparty purchases to billion the other nii benefits were from a higher day count and not replacing longterm debt maturities partially offset by the impact of declining average commercial loan balances and lower loan yields ppprelated interest income was million this quarter unchanged relative to the prior quarter on the liability side we reduced our interest bearing core deposit cost by another basis point this quarter to basis points and also had maturities of approximately billion of longterm debt with most deposit products at or near their assumed floors the remaining liability management benefits going forward will likely be limited to cds and reductions in longterm debt balances due to maturities reported nim increased basis point compared to the prior quarter as the aforementioned investment portfolio longterm debt and ginnie mae loan buyout impacts were partially offset by the decline in commercial loan balances and lower loan yields underlying nim excluding ppp and excess cash increased basis points to basis points with a highly assetsensitive balance sheet and over billion in excess liquidity we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise while also remaining wellhedged if rates remained low given our securities portfolio and derivatives total reported noninterest income decreased just sequentially adjusted noninterest income increased driven by record commercial banking revenue with strength in loan syndications and financial risk management products solid card and processing revenue from higher credit and debit interchange revenue reflecting the robust economic rebound and an increase in both commercial and consumer deposit fees these increases were partially offset by sequential declines in mortgage and lease syndications top line mortgage banking revenue decreased million sequentially reflecting incremental margin pressure production was strong during the quarter in both the retail and correspondent channels with second quarter originations of billion up sequentially compared to the yearago quarter adjusted noninterest income increased with strength in deposit service charges commercial banking revenue wealth and asset management and card and processing revenue reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business and the robust economic rebound over the past year the performance and resilience of our fee income levels over the past several quarters highlight the benefit of the revenue diversification that we have achieved noninterest expense decreased compared to the first quarter reflecting declines in compensation and benefits expenses lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiations and disciplined expense management throughout the bank this was partially offset by expenses linked to strong business performance as well as servicing expenses associated with loan purchases and a million marktomarket impact from our fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 nonqualified deferred compensation plans which had a corresponding offset in security gain for the full year we expect to incur around million in thirdparty servicing expense for purchase loans our compensationrelated expense growth this year continues to be proportionate to the success we are seeing in our feebased businesses on a yearoveryear basis total adjusted fees have increased compared to expense growth additionally compared to the prepandemic levels of the second quarter of total adjusted fees have increased compared to expense growth of just moving to the balance sheet total average loans and leases were up sequentially as consumer loan growth was partially offset by a decline in commercial loans additionally period end loans were up excluding ppp average total consumer loans increased as ongoing strength in the auto portfolio and the impact of ginnie mae loans purchased were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances reflecting the continued impacts of government stimulus average commercial loans declined compared to the prior quarter largely driven by ppp forgiveness and elevated payoffs which were partially offset by strong production across most of our verticals and throughout our middle market footprint production was up compared to the prior quarter and up over compared to the prepandemic levels of the second quarter of excluding the impact of ppp our endofperiod ci loans were up slightly sequentially as client sentiment and business activities in several industries are showing signs of stabilization revolver utilization of was flat compared to the prior quarter reflecting the market liquidity and capital markets conditions we are encouraged by the fact that we have successfully retained virtually all clients throughout the pandemic which will enable us to further deepen and grow these relationships going forward average cre loans were flat sequentially with endofperiod balances declining our securities portfolio increased this quarter we continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows but well remain patient on deploying the excess cash we will continue to be opportunistic as the economic environment evolves assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook we would expect to increase our cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200basispoint level we remain optimistic that strong economic growth in the second half of and an eventual fed tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive riskreturn opportunities in the future average shortterm investments which includes interest bearing cash remain elevated due to continued strength in core deposit balances which have grown yearoveryear we have seen strength in both consumer and commercial deposits compared to the prior quarter average core deposits increased about twothirds of the balance growth on a sequential and yearoveryear basis has come from consumer reflecting continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and strong household growth moving to credit our strong credit performance once again this quarter reflects our disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and prudent balance sheet management while also benefiting from continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and improvement in the broader economy the second quarter net chargeoff ratio of basis points was historically low and improved basis points sequentially nonperforming assets declined or million the npa ratio declined basis points sequentially to basis points which is comparable to the fourth quarter of fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 also our criticized assets declined with significant improvements in retail nonessential leisure and healthcare as well as in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios however we continue to focus on nonowner occupied commercial real estate particularly central business district hotels moving to the acl our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes the labor market continues to improve and job growth continues to strengthen with unemployment reaching by the first quarter of and ending our threeyear reasonable and supportable period at around we did not change our scenario weights of to the base and to the upside and downside scenarios applying a probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a million reserve release conversely applying to the downside scenario would result in a million build inclusive of the impact of approximately million in remaining discount associated with the mb loan portfolio our acl ratio was additionally excluding the billion in ppp loans with virtually no associated credit reserve the acl ratio would be approximately while the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out given the uncertain environment we continue to monitor the covid situation which could still impact many businesses particularly those we have identified as being in highly impacted industries or reverse the rising consumer confidence trends our june 30th allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment with lower unemployment and continued improving credit quality moving to capital our capital levels remained strong in the second quarter our cet1 ratio ended the quarter at which is billion above our stated target of our tangible book value per share excluding aoci increased during the quarter as a category iv institution fifth third was not subject to the latest federal reserve stress tests and we did not optin at the end of june the fed notified us that our scb would be effective july which is the floor under the regulatory capital rules without the floor our buffer would have been approximately during the quarter we completed million in share repurchases which reduced our share count by approximately million shares compared to the first quarter as greg mentioned we expect to repurchase approximately million of shares in the second half of while also increasing our common dividend in september we also announced our acquisition of provide this quarter we will utilize approximately basis points of cet1 upon closing this financially compelling acquisition of an assetgeneration engine dovetails perfectly with our existing strategic focus on digital enablement and generating profitable growth on our balance sheet we believe in provides strong growth prospects from an originations standpoint they have produced million in the first half of of which fifth third purchased approximately we expect second half originations to be around million and given the expected early august closing virtually all of that will go on our balance sheet we expect over billion in originations in and could grow to over billion annually within a few years fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 moving to our current outlook for the full year we expect average total loan balances to be stable compared to last year reflecting continued pressure from ppp forgiveness and paydowns in commercial combined with low doubledigit growth in consumer we continue to expect cre balances to remain stable in this environment we continue to expect our underlying nim to be in the 305basispoint area for the full year combined with our loan outlook we expect nii to be down this year assuming stable security balances and incorporating all ppp impacts on a sequential basis we expect nii to decline around given the impacts of the securities portfolio prepayment income we experienced in the second quarter that we do not assume will repeat in our outlook as well as an assumed decline in ppp income within our nii guidance we expect approximately million in ppprelated interest income for of which million was realized in the first half of the year compared to million in and approximately million expected in for the third quarter of we expect approximately million in ppp income therefore excluding ppp impacts we would expect third quarter nii to decline around compared to the second quarter or up over from the third quarter of given the continued strength throughout our businesses we expect fullyear fees to increase to compared to or to excluding the impact of the tra our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy as well as our ongoing success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities resulting in stronger processing revenue capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue which will be partially offset by mortgage declines additionally as we discussed in january we expect to generate private equity gains from several of our direct investments and venture capital funds throughout potentially exceeding the level of million we have recognized around million in gains through the first half of which we expect to double in the second half of we expect third quarter total fees to be relatively stable from the second quarter and would be up mid to high single digits yearoveryear in the mortgage business we expect revenue throughout the second half of the year to benefit from lower asset decay and higher servicing fees the top line revenue is expected to decline high single digits yearoveryear due to continued headwinds from margin compression our fee outlook does not incorporate a pretax gain of approximately million associated with the sale of our hsa business that is expected to close in the third quarter we do plan to redeploy half of that gain in the third quarter split evenly between a million donation to the fifth third foundation that will complete our previously announced philanthropy commitment to accelerating racial equality and inclusion in our communities and a million additional marketing program supporting momentum given the upside potential we see in that product we expect fullyear expenses to be up to given our strong revenue outlook and the continued servicing costs from the loan portfolio purchases as well as the incremental expenses associated with the provide acquisition on a sequential basis we expect expenses to be down excluding the redeployment of half of the hsa gain as weve recently discussed we expect to consolidate branches primarily in our legacy midwest footprint which we expect to complete in early additionally weve opened five branches so far this year and plan to add approximately more southeast inmarket de novo branches in the second half of all run rate branch impacts are included in our outlook fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 we generated yearoveryear positive operating leverage this quarter and we expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage for the second half of reflecting our expense actions our continued success growing our feebased businesses and our proactive balance sheet management we expect total net chargeoffs in to be to basis points given the strong first half performance and assuming our base case scenario continues to play out third quarter losses are likely to be in the to basispoint range in summary our second quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress weve made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle we will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and a focus on a longterm performance horizon which has served us well during this environment with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll senior vice president headinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks jamie before we start qa as a courtesy to others we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions we will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning operator please open the call up for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning ken james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp morning ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc you guys are doing a lot to make fifth third more consumerfriendly like early pay and extra time if we expect that trend to continue like whats the total amount of fees or revenue that might be at risk is the broader industry really continues to wean itself off of consumer fees fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah ken its jamie thanks for the question the one thing we are proud of at fifth third is how much weve reduced our exposure on the consumer side from a punitive fee standpoint and how we are i would say a very consumerfocused and consumerfriendly bank i think or so of our revenue is in consumer overdrafts and our peers are significantly higher than those levels we expect to continue to improve upon that with the momentum bank offering and some of the features that greg talked about in his prepared remarks so i think you can continue to expect that from us and that if we were to have any future changes on overdraft policies or fees it would only be to the positive and that we would more than make up for with the incremental volume from momentum i dont know tim if theres anything else you want to add timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah no i just want to emphasize that i mean whenever you launch a new product the tradeoff yet to evaluate is what you think you can produce as it relates to total franchise growth relative to any sort of cannibalization right so the fact that we have been deliberate about driving revenue growth through valueadded services as opposed to maintenance and punitive fees means that for us were going to get the benefit of the franchise growth and more households from momentum with comparatively substantially less impact than any of our large competitors would have to the extent that they would attempt to follow us here ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then just maybe a second question in terms of the ginnie mae buyouts i think some of the other banks this quarter have mentioned they just didnt see the opportunity or they didnt have or they couldnt find the opportunity whatever to do a lot the ginnie mae buyouts but it feels like you guys got a fairly decent benefit from that this quarter was that are you seeing the same trends or do you still see opportunities to continue that going forward james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp a very good question actually because what weve seen is that given we were first mover in this product as far back as the third quarter of when we bought our own pools and then helped structure these additional purchases that weve done totaling billion thus far todate i would say that the economics were certainly more attractive if you were in the first mover stage and the economics have really waned to the point that we would not be pursuing additional purchases at these levels ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp sure r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i just wanted to ask at sort of a top level on sort of the eventuality about commercial recovery whats in your best guess as to what that will look like for larger regionals like yourself its sort of unclear the degree to which capital markets competition will abate i guess there are questions regarding the sustainability of the sort of the sugar high that consumers are on right now meaning demand could decrease the further we go and then youve got all this excess liquidity thats getting worked through so just curious to hear your toplevel thoughts on what that recovery will ultimately look like in your eyes gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp let me start then ill hand over to jamie or tim for additional color first off its right now theres just a lot of uncertainty out there right now as were dealing with the labor shortages and supply chain disruptions which are extremely real you see it across the board in all conversations with our customers but with that said were back to pretty much prepandemic level production numbers but payouts continue to be stout and obviously youve got some of the headwind with ppp so when you think about the environment in front of us i think loan growth this will continue to be a challenge as we go through the rest of the year i think we offset that by our strength from our fee businesses as weve talked about in the prepared remarks to compensate for some of those challenges but i do think this changes over time you think about our line utilization at we run every is million so theres a lot of upside opportunity there at some point labor shortage and supply chain constraints start to abate and we pick up the benefit of that we also added about billion in new commitments since the beginning of the year and continue to acquire new households and commercial relationships so were very very positive as to what the future might hold while weve got some economic and some environmental challenges in front of us to be able to continue to deal with timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah no i think when we announced northstar and we talked about pivoting the return profile of the bank to be good through the cycle a portion of focus there was on business mix right it was about constructing a business portfolio that had balance so in an environment where utilization is down like now and where rates are low we have fee businesses that are firing that are providing nice support and some countercyclical businesses in particular on the consumer side like autos and mortgages which are doing very very well right i think as some of the tailwind from those businesses abates what you would expect to see is the benefit both as greg mentioned as it relates to line utilization and ultimately some benefit from rates which provides a lot of support for the throughthecycle focus fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you for those thoughts and then maybe just a thought on overall reserving levels you guys still maintain a very high and conservative overall reserve how are you sort of thinking about the steady state is it back to where we were cecl day one or just given the backdrop in what weve already gone through can we kind of blow through that a little bit on meaning lower than that how do you think about those dynamics james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp its jamie ill take that one when you look at the quarter with the acl release of million we had that split fairly evenly between the consumer portfolio and the commercial portfolio and the decline was essentially driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook versus the prior quarter when you look ahead we continue to overweight the nonbaseline scenarios at so that the upside is the base is and the downside is and thats really driven by the uncertainty in the environment including the vaccine efficacy and frankly this weeks concerns highlight that risk so when you look at the asymmetrical nature of the upside and downside scenarios that weighting versus the on cecl day one generates about million higher reserves so i guess the first part to your fairly complicated question is that the scenario weightings do matter and we expect to maintain the while this period of uncertainty continues to exist and then relative to day one it really is a tale of two portfolios so when you look at the commercial side to get back to those dayone adoption reserve rates you really do need to see a sustained strength on even the credit characteristics of the borrowers that are most at risk due to longerterm negative impacts from the pandemic and so that would have to occur in conjunction with improving an economic forecast above our current expectations but then when you look at the consumer side were actually already below the cecl dayone level were at at the end of the second quarter versus the on cecl day one and thats driven by the combination of the loan mix as well as improvements in real estate and auto collateral values experienced since the adoption of cecl as well as the economic forecasts at the end of the second quarter and then weve had improvement in credit quality in auto and card as well as in the delinquency rate so consumer is already there but commercial again wed have to have things play out differently than what we better than what we currently expect r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right thank you guys very much for those thoughts operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america securities ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i just wanted to go back greg on your announcement partnering with fis on the modern core and on the wealth management side if you could give us some visibility on three things one what that means for nearterm expense impact what it means for longerterm efficiency as you kind of go through that process if you could tell us what the timeline would be and then finally we are hearing from other banks talking about moving to a modern core and that being a competitive advantage do you see that as a competitive advantage for fifth third when you get to that point or is it table stakes given where the industry is moving gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp okay thats a lot there so let me try and dissect a little bit for you first off the fis announcement we just made is a continuation of a relationship thats been in place for quite some time as a replacement of our wam through our core deposit platforms but weve been on this journey to reengineer our technical infrastructure focusing on the actual resiliency the scalability of our businesses replace our hr platform with workday we completed our enterprise and data strategy we completely replatformed our mortgage los environment so the fis is the natural extension of the continuation of the modernization of those activities and we also reengineered and restructured the pricing agreement of our legacy relationship with fis thats going to help make the costs associated with that implementation of the new fis components a lot more reasonable digestible for us that will manage our costs going forward so were pretty pleased with the way that came out as far as the competitive advantage listen i think at the end of the day this is a long game we have to continue to refresh our platforms were going to continue to modernize our platforms to the cloud i think every bank is trying to get this right so whether it becomes a competitive advantage or not i think its a requirement and its basically table stakes to be in a business to be a digital bank our customers expect the bank anywhere anytime we have to have platforms that are always on so thats just the retransformation of our business we have to repurpose our expense dollars from the legacy brickandmortar infrastructure and weve got to continue to reinvestment in technology so were going to continue to do that and i think the banks that dont do that are going to be at competitive disadvantage but many banks as youve already heard will continue to focus on core modernization and were going to be doing the same thing we think we have a great strategy for that modernization and for bringing in new technologies we have a buy partnerbuild strategy that weve worked on very hard and if the technology is already out there we buy it if we cant buy it we partner and if we cant partner we build it momentum is example of that partnerships like greensky avidxchange dadesystems commonbond and down the list and our recent acquisition of provide so i think weve got a good strategy for moving quickly but it is going to take time to get all the legacy stuff re platformed but netnet once again i think it may not be a competitive advantage at the end of the day but it definitely will be a requirement to be in this business in the future ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 thats good color appreciate it and just as a followup to that when you think about acquisition of provide healthcare is obviously a very hot sector do you see more opportunities like that across different verticals where maybe we should expect similar kind of deals which become tools for client acquisitions timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah sure this is tim im happy to take that one so healthcare was the right starting point for us its the first industry vertical that we launched here over a decade ago and we have a vertically integrated strategy on that front across our corporate banking group our middle market banking group out in the regions and now also business banking i think provide was an important next step for us in this strategy because it gave us the opportunity to provide a differentiated value proposition to independent medical practices like greg mentioned with a big focus on dentists vets and otherwise and provide was a little bit unique in that it had as a fintech company actually already grown into one of the largest lenders into that market driven primarily by their technology and their expertise and just as a point of example there the digital experience that they offer enables them to get loans approved and closed about faster than a typical lending process within that market and in addition because of the sector focus they have a growing digital marketplace that actually allows existing practice owners who would like to transition into retirement to post their practices for sale and they get connected with folks who are interested in buying an established practice and so it functions i guess a little bit like the craigslist or the ebay of dental practices today are there opportunities in other verticals yeah we do think there are and we have been pretty active as greg mentioned in partnering with many of those firms whether those relationships evolve from a partnership into an outright acquisition i think it depends a lot on the circumstances and business at any given point in time but in the case of provide their next leg of the growth journey was going to be about the delivery of the broad the full set of products and services and it absolutely made sense for them to be part of the bank as opposed to a stand alone entity on that journey ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thanks for taking my questions timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yes operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning greg good morning jamie fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning gerard james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jamie this question is for you on the securities portfolio can you share with us i saw the yield as you presented in your deck increase sequentially and i was wondering how you achieved that in this rate environment and was it due to the derivatives and hedges you have on the books and then second i think you said that obviously youre going to keep the liquidity in the portfolio until rates start to rise i think you mentioned the rate would you lean into it as rates were to go to if they do or would you wait until we actually got to before you really move james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i think if you look back at our actions in the first quarter to answer the second part of your question if you look back at our first quarter actions we did leg into a little bit of additional investment portfolio buildup at that point in time we preinvested billion of our second quarter cash flows and then given the entry points and the rally in the bond market decided to maintain that additional leverage throughout the quarter so we did grow the book a little bit in the second quarter our guide assumes we hold it fairly stable as the year progresses because we dont expect to get to those or better entry points but should the market get there we would leg into the trade and not do everything all at once but when you look at our additional billion of excess liquidity that were sitting on weve earmarked about onethird of that to go into the investment portfolio so to get billion of purchases done would certainly take some time and weve ramped that up over time and our goal here is we sift through peer results and actions versus ours and we certainly are an outlier in terms of being i think more prudent and more cautious at deploying at these low rates our goal is lets maximize our nii over the next five years not over the next months and we think ultimately that this is the better outcome and the fed will eventually taper not sure when that will be but when the largest bond buyer in the world is price indiscriminate in their purchases every month it certainly distorts the market so eventually that distortion is going to end and we think well get better entry points than what we see today and then in terms of the first part of your question the growth in the yield this quarter in the investment portfolio is really the benefit of what we did five years ago with structuring the portfolio to be more weighted to bullet and lockedout cash flows so that to the extent there are prepayments in the portfolio the makewhole provisions provide a nice pickup in investment yield and as we we never include those in our outlook so that the guide on nii might look soft on the surface but if things continue to be the same then obviously nii will outperform the guide should those prepayment penalties continue to occur were sitting on almost billion in gains in the investment portfolio fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for the color and then greg ive asked this question in the past but ill ask it again which is when you sit down with your senior management team and you guys look out over the risks that you foresee in the horizon and if we take the delta variant and the covid risk off the table since thats an obvious one what are some of the risks that you guys wrestle with as you look out over the next months that we just have to keep our eye on and looking around the corner so that were not surprised a year from now gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah its a good question obviously i would have responded immediately with the variant of covid and what that could mean to the slowing down of the economy and not getting the robust recovery we were all hoping for and creating risk i think right now as i mentioned earlier gerard i think about every customer i sit down with tim sits down with and we have a conversation and youre seeing it in various ways labor shortage supply chain constraints significant issues out there right now youre seeing that in backlogs order delays restaurants not being able to be open small businesses not open fulltime cant get labor so its a big challenge right now and when does that start to abate when does that start to correct itself and im not sure when that is i believe itll happen obviously but to whether thats later this year or is it the next year so i think thats going to put a lot of pressure inventory levels are extremely low compared with the demand that is out there were not seeing that tick up right now line utilization is kind of flat right now but were not seeing that tick up that we were hoping to see so those are all kind of concerns that i have right now obviously inflation is another concern out there as we watch that and how the fed manages through that complexity and more to come on that but netnet i think overall the economy is fairly healthy weve just got some challenges still in front of us that havent been understood yet timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp and on that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc im sorry go ahead gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp tim had one thing timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp no i just was going to say if you just to add a little bit of color greg and i together were out we spent a full day in of our regions this quarter which made for a busy travel schedule but a lot of good input in terms of what were actually hearing from clients on the ground and i mean some of the stories that you hear about how people are dealing with the labor shortages or inventory supply issues are wild i mean we have a client a field marketer who had to open their own driving school so that they can get people enough folks with qualified fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 commercial drivers licenses to do field deliveries you have hospitals who are operating at capacity on the elective portions of their business which are really important driver right when you think about the revenues gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp to make a move timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah who cant get enough skilled nursing staff on hand to be able to operate at levels above that and we had folks who had been sending employees out to a local cvs or a walgreens and buying out all of the gorilla glue because the adhesives that are used to seal together their cardboard packaging are backlogged owing to the hard freeze in texas this last winter i mean it really theyre not theoretical concepts when you get out and you talk to our middlemarket clients they are really hard realities that they are grappling with and i think as greg said we all hope that especially if the enhanced unemployment benefits wane and as we work through some of these supply chain challenges that our clients are able to invest in their business but if you cant get the people you cant get the materials you cant invest to grow gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc is there any risk and just to followup quickly that theres a permanent change in the way these companies will manage themselves which would lead to a lesser need from borrowing from banks like yours because of what theyre going through have you heard that at all from your customers timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp no no not yet i think we hear them exploring opportunities to be less reliant on manual labor and to drive automation but that drives capex right so that helps us we hear them exploring opportunities to secure more captive supply and otherwise through ma but that also drives borrowing in terms of the way that we operate and ironically actually we hear many of them say hey we have been pushing for decades now to run more asset light which meant less liquidity on hand and maybe we dont want to do that going forward and were willing to absorb slightly higher debt service costs in favour of being a little bit more liquid and that would be helpful to us in terms of the way it drives borrowing so i dont think so gerard its just we got to see our way through to the other side of this because if you cant get labor you cant get inventory its hard to grow gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you for all the color appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning can you relate the fee income strength you saw this quarter to the growth youre seeing in the southeast region are you leading in the southeast with your feebased products like treasury management rather than credit as you grow into that region and if you could discuss the longerterm growth outlook across your other feebased products in the southeast timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah sure bill its tim ill take that i think the growth if you look at new client relationships and otherwise is very strong in the commercial business in the southeast so they are contributing disproportionately to the incremental fee income but i wouldnt tell you that it is focused exclusively on the southeast if you look at our new commercial relationships about of them this year are lead with treasury management and then there is another percentage which i dont have off the top of my head but which has come to us primarily through the capital markets business so we are having good success using those products as wedge opportunities to drive new relationships if you look forward i think were trying to build what is a really nicely diversified capital markets business with low activities like rates and commodities hedging and otherwise to complement the ma advisory business and what we do in equities with what we do on the bond market i think what we continue to anticipate is at some point here the capital markets will be a little bit less accommodative well get the benefit of that in loan balances but youll see some lightning on bond fees but the other side of it is were sitting on an ma pipeline now which is almost double what it was in january of this year so we do have a nice ma advisory pipeline that should come behind it on the treasury management side weve pretty consistently grown at the rate of the industry plus to percentage points i am of the belief that we can do better than that but its definitely better to be taking share there over time than just to have the alternative situation so we feel good about both of those fee lines over the near to medium term bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you and greg you mentioned greensky when talking about your partnerships earlier can you give us an update on how youre thinking about indirect lending partnerships more broadly and the opportunity to leverage these partnerships to continue to grow naturally beyond your footprint critics of that model argue that you really need to own the relationship and are at a disadvantage when all youre doing is putting up your balance sheet and somebody else has the relationship with the customer but would love to hear your thoughts gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp first off theres not a lot of these opportunities out there the economics of the greensky relationship and as we wanted as an investor have made a lot of sense for us this is not how we grow our business over time were much more relationship business thats why the provide acquisition was extremely important if you think about provide that was a partnership originally we had about million in assets but of those relationships we had additional relationship outside the credit facility whether it be tm or deposit relationship so that was important fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 so relationship type of opportunity for us and thats what were looking for to continue to enhance our business and grow our businesses greensky created another channel for us but yes thats a nonrelationship business for us and those opportunities that make sense to us are very few out there but the greensky one does for the economics and the transaction weve put in place bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thats super helpful thank you operator our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks and good morning couple of quick ones first of all the third quarter momentum marketing program that you mentioned where you used part of that benefit is that just to get it kick started and then would you have ongoing expenses related to marketing built into your forward outlook past james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah its jamie yes the million incremental spend over the second quarter marketing spend level of million so we expect to spend million to marketing in the third quarter that should abate going forward however if it is successful then well continue the program at that elevated level until weve really captured as much of the first mover advantage with the product as we can kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it understood and then do you have any plans to or thoughts on resecuritizing those ginnie mae loans the billion that you mentioned i know some of them are newer so they might not have quite gotten to that seasoning point yet but is that at all in your outlook in terms of whether they stay in loans or move to mortgage banking over time james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp so for the billion of loans that weve purchased from other thirdparty servicers we have a theres a nominal amount of fees assumed in the outlook related to that as they get resold to the servicer the bigger economic opportunity is on the million of forbearance loans that we bought directly back from ginnie mae on our own production as well as within our resi mortgage portfolio to the extent that there are any on nonaccrual or delinquents that cure we do have we have had sales this year that generate several million dollars in fees and we expect to do that over the next six seven quarters as well so i think its more of a run rate normal course of business than it is any onetime pop kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc that makes sense last one just you redeemed a bunch of debt mostly at the banks some at the parent is there any more room to do that as thats obviously still the highest cost of funding but again you have all the excess fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 deposits whats the balancing act in terms of where you want that longterm debt footprint to settle over time thanks guys james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah given the excess liquidity that we have theres clearly not a need to maintain the higher unsecured debt levels that we have we have an additional maturity in the third quarter well most likely not replace thats about million almost of rate so theres a little bit left to go in terms of improvement along with running down the wholesale cd book but those benefits are all baked into our outlook so i would not expect it to get better than what weve guided to from the righthand side of the sheet i think the opportunity for us from an nii improvement standpoint will be on the lefthand side of the sheet kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you jamie operator our next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi morning gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp morning john james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the loan growth side on the utilization i know you expect it to improve by about through the yearend can you just help out with what is your prepandemic utilization level and maybe an expected timing where you think you can get back to that level on that front gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah its a great question i wish i knew the answer to that i do know that first part of the year we would typically run around as i mentioned every is about our million in assets so were running at kind of flat line right there i cant really were hopeful but like i tell my team hope is not a strategy were hopeful we start to see that tick up a little bit based on the production levels that were seeing out there right now hopefully get some of these challenges in front of us on the supply chain and labor for us maybe abating a little later this year but once again its a tough thing to say when do we get back to a normalized run rate its going to be a while i mean its going to be in quarters not and maybe a year plus before we get there i believe fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 john pancari q analyst evercore isi no thats helpful and on that same topic on the loan growth guide i know you indicated a doubledigit consumer growth stable cre youve got ppp impacting commercial what would be your growth expectation for commercial with ppp and exppp on that fullyear guide james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp relatively stable on commercial yeah i would say john i would say fullyear commercial average loans would be down midsingle digits and exppp a little bit more than that but ending the year with a little bit closer to stable and then ppp is weve been running steadily down as the year has progressed where on an endof period basis we finished the first quarter at billion we finished the second quarter at billion that will continue to drift down to billion at the end of the third quarter and then billion at yearend is our current projection on ppp john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks and then lastly on the ma front as you look at the incremental opportunities there greg just wanted to get your thoughts on potential incremental bank and nonbank and i guess more importantly curious what you think of president bidens executive order and the implied added scrutiny around bank deals do you believe that could impact a bank of your size looking at a potential whole bank deal gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah i guess first off i would respond by saying our focus is on nonbank transactions that enhance our product and service capabilities like provide would be a great example of that so well stay focused there for the most part if the right opportunity presents itself in a market thats attractive to us it kind of solves what mb financial solved for us in chicago obviously we always consider those type of opportunities but theyre far and few between and not the focus of the organization as far as bidens executive order listen theres a lot of work to be done the agencies the occ fed and fdic and the doj are trying to figure out what that means so more to come on that but you can believe as i do that transactions the economics of transactions could be more challenging going forward its an executive order and the timeline to get those transactions approved they take a little bit longer but good transactions will get done john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks for taking my questions gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp sure operator our next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning guys just talk a bit more about the path to the cet1 target obviously you talked about the dividend increase the buybacks back half this year the 20basispoint drag but if you put all that together youre still going to be it seems like kind of treading water on the capital just given the good earnings generation and probably not a lot of balance sheet growth the next few quarters so do you think youll get that target or youre going to hold back for kind of the loan growth and maybe just flesh it out a little bit as we think about the first half next year james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah our goal is certainly to get to the by june of and yes it is certainly a large amount of repurchases i think the two factors to bake into it would be theres basis points of cet1 erosion from the provide acquisition in the third quarter and then basis points of cecl transition in the first quarter of so a little bit of capital gets spent there but yes to your point we have a lot of capital deployment opportunity ahead of us to get to the and certainly if loan growth doesnt materialize then well look to continue to hit the and then we do feel that should loan growth accelerates we certainly have a buffer from where we think we need to run the company from a capital perspective clearly from the credit outcomes youre seeing we could run the balance sheet at or so if loan growth were to accelerate but for now our focus is just getting to the by midyear next year matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thank you operator our next question comes from peter winter with wedbush peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp morning peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i wanted to ask just on the middle market and small business are you seeing any willingness of them maybe to tap their lines of credit while maintaining higher levels of cash on hand or is it just an issue of the supply and labor shortages thats holding it all back timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 hey peter its tim i would tell you its primarily issues with supply chain and labor like greg said and not liquidity if youre looking for green shoots i think the borrowers who are either smaller or who rely on structures that look more like assetbased lending structures are starting to tap their lines so we are seeing modest improvements in utilization in that sector now in aggregate thats not a large segment of our balance sheet which is the reason that you see utilization overall at fifth third being stable but generally as these things happen they happen at the lower end of the book first then they migrate upward into the larger borrowers so i at least when i feel like finding a positive signal thats where im going these days peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and then jamie can i just ask about the outlook for the margin in the second half of the year some of the puts and takes james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp sure the second quarter was obviously very strong from a margin perspective and were pleased with how the balance sheet has been performing but given the high levels of ppp as well as the investment securities prepayment penalties that we dont expect to recur or at least dont forecast to recur we would expect to see the nim decline a bit to a more normalized level which is that 305basispoint area is what weve talked about but i think pretty much all year in terms of what we think this balance sheet should stabilize at certainly for the foreseeable future so nim should come down call it bps or so in the third quarter with say the big drivers there certainly the ppp the prepayment penalties a little bit of day count and otherwise still maintain that floor of basis points or better peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of david konrad with kbw david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning a quick followup on the securities portfolio maybe jamie can you remind us what the remaining duration is for the bullet structured product james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp so the total portfolio is a years duration and so the bullets when we quote the number were saying its bullet or lockedout for at least the next two years but the duration of that portfolio is not that different from the portfolio in total david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so the lockout is two additional years fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp correct but theres not a step down for a while we had quoted a 12month and then we got the question so we expanded it to months but theres not a cliff here its just a slow erosion over time david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator our next question is from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks just wanted to go back to the regulatory question before greg is the environment any different than it would have been six or nine months ago whether its a cfpb or any of the agencies gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp well listen obviously with the deck sic desk chairs changing right now and are still in process on the cfpb front from a nomination perspective so is it changed listen i dont believe its changed to be honest with you i think at the end of day these agencies have a job to do and a role to play and i think the focus of the cfpb and the occ and the fdic are going to be making sure that theres the safety and soundness but also the way that banks handle themselves and operate are going to be extremely important so i havent sensed a big shift with the new administration on requirements and demands of the bank and the totality so to speak from the top as to what they expect from us so its not something that keeps me up at night lets put it that way christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc good greg thank you for that and thanks for all the background this morning gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thank you operator those are all the questions we have at this time are there any closing remarks chris doll senior vice president headinvestor relations fifth third bancorp yes
