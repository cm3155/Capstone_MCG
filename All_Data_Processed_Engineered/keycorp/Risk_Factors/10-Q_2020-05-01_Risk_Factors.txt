of the pandemic could result in a further increase to our loan loss reserve oil prices have declined significantly which could lead to increased credit losses in our oil and gas loan portfolio the oil market has faced a dropoff in demand due to the impact of the covid19 global pandemic on much of the global economy the decline in demand coupled with insufficient storage capacity for oil has caused oil prices to decline significantly as a result oil companies may begin to halt production as the oil and gas sector continues to suffer from low oil prices companies in that sector will have lower revenues and cash flows oil companies may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection as well our oil and gas loan portfolio represented only of our total loans at march and our exposure is primarily reservebased with approximately half tied to natural gas which has shown better price performance however even with our limited exposure the negative impact of low oil prices could result in increased credit losses to us ii operational risk the covid19 global pandemic has resulted in increased operational risks the covid19 pandemic has resulted in heightened operational risks much of our workforce

level for an unknown period of time separately our thirdparty service providers have also been impacted by the pandemic and we have experienced some disruption to certain services performed by vendors

our business iii liquidity risk the covid19 global pandemic may continue to cause uncertainty in markets and may result in an increase in our cost of funds the covid19 global pandemic has caused a great amount of uncertainty in markets causing credit markets to seize and forcing companies including our clients to seek liquidity in the face of uncertain future cash flows to the extent the clients funds are not used as working capital and not placed on deposit with keybank we could be faced with funding significant draws of committed lending facilities along with requests for new facilities from our clients as a result of the pandemic we have seen the utilization rate on committed commercial lines of credit increase additionally clients continue to look to key for additional funding vehicles until the capital markets become more stable and available as clients use deposit balances to fund their businesses this may put funding pressure on key which may cause us to leverage our secured funding sources or pay higher rates than normal for additional funding iv market risk the impact of the covid19 global pandemic has resulted in economic disruption related to interest rate
