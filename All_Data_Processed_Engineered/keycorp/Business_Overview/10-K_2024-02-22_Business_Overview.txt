regulation the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers the dif taxpayers and the banking system as a whole rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in and remains ongoing with additional reforms expected following the bank failures that occurred in early we cannot predict changes in applicable laws regulations or regulatory agency policies but any such changes may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations or access to liquidity or credit overview federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators i the occ for national banks and federal savings associations ii the fdic for state nonmember banks and savings associations iii the federal reserve for state member banks iv the cfpb for consumer financial products or services v the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities vi the sec cftc and nfa for swaps and other derivatives and vii state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a broker or a dealer in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation under the bhca bhcs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without prior approval from the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities however a bhc that satisfies certain requirements regarding management capital adequacy and community reinvestment act performance may elect to be treated as a financial holding company fhc for purposes of federal law and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities keycorp has elected to be treated as a fhc and as such is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing insurance agency and underwriting and merchant banking activities in addition the federal reserve has permitted fhcs like keycorp to engage in the following activities under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity physical commodities trading activities energy management services and energy tolling among others under federal law a bhc also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress this support may be required when the bhc does not have the resources to or would prefer not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition table of contents federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bhc any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment the doddfrank act created the fsoc to overlay the us supervisory framework for bhcs insured depository institutions and other financial service providers by serving as a systemic risk oversight body specifically the fsoc is authorized to i identify risks to us financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure or ongoing activities of large interconnected sifis or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace ii promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the us government will shield shareholders creditors and counterparties from losses in the event of failure and iii respond to emerging threats to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination information collection and sharing designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the federal reserve designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment clearing and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight recommending stricter standards for sifis and together with the federal reserve determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to us financial stability as an fhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain more limited regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and the doddfrank act we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations because keybank engages in derivative transactions in it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became a member of the nfa the selfregulatory organization for participants in the us derivatives industry our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business regulatory capital requirements background keycorp and keybank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee the basel committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale and to promote financial stability the regulatory capital framework developed by the basel committee and implemented in the united states is a predominately riskbased capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets adjusted to reflect credit risk riskweighted assets each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum riskbased capital measures eg a tier riskbased capital ratio requirement of tier capital to total riskweighted assets and in the united states a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier capital to average total onbalance sheet assets which serves as a backstop to the riskbased measures a capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis capital instruments with relatively robust lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier while other capital instruments with relatively less lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier a banking organizations total capital equals the sum of its tier and tier capital the basel committee also developed a market risk capital framework that also has been implemented in the united states to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit riskbased capital requirements described above for example the minimum total riskbased capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organizations total capital to the sum of its credit riskweighted assets and market table of contents riskweighted assets only keycorp is subject to the market risk capital rule as keybank does not engage in substantial trading activity basel iii to address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the global financial crisis in the basel committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework commonly referred to as basel iii the basel iii revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital in part through the introduction of a common equity tier capital requirement provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage particularly for securitization exposures equities and offbalance sheet positions and address procyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers the basel committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation eg arbitrage opportunities between the credit riskbased and market risk capital rules and in connection with the global financial crisis keycorp and keybank are subject to regulatory capital requirements implemented by the us banking agencies that are based largely on basel iii regulatory capital rules consistent with the international framework the regulatory capital rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier and tier capital establish a minimum common equity tier capital ratio requirement of and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment and refine several of the methodologies used for determining riskweighted assets the regulatory capital rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over billion in total consolidated assets or billion in foreign exposure but those additional requirements do not apply to keycorp or keybank however some of those additional requirements will apply to keycorp and keybank if proposed revisions to the regulatory capital rules are adopted the proposed revisions to the regulatory capital rules are discussed below under the heading recent regulatory capitalrelated developments for purposes of the regulatory capital rules keycorp and keybank are treated as standardized approach banking organizations under the regulatory capital rules standardized approach banking organizations such as keycorp and keybank are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table at december keycorps ratios under the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules are set forth in the following table minimum capital ratios and keycorp ratios under regulatory capital rules table start ratios including stress capital buffer regulatory minimum requirement stress capital buffer b regulatory minimum with stress capital buffer keycorp december c common equity tier tier capital total capital leverage a na table end a as a standardized approach banking organization keycorp is not subject to the supplementary leverage ratio requirement which became effective january however keycorp will be subject to the supplementary leverage ratio if proposed revisions to the regulatory capital rules discussed below are adopted b stress capital buffer must consist of common equity tier capital as a standardized approach banking organization keycorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the regulatory capital rules however keycorp will be subject to the countercyclical capital buffer if proposed revisions to the regulatory capital rules discussed below are adopted c ratios reflect the fiveyear transition of cecl impacts on regulatory ratios revised prompt corrective action framework the federal prompt corrective action pca framework under the fdia groups fdicinsured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework in the united states the regulatory capital rules also revised the pca capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions such as keybank with an effective date of january the revised pca framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action framework table of contents well capitalized and adequately capitalized capital category ratios under revised prompt corrective action framework table start prompt corrective action capital category ratio well capitalized a adequately capitalized common equity tier riskbased tier riskbased total riskbased tier leverage b table end a a well capitalized institution also must not be subject to any written agreement order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure b as a standardized approach banking organization keybank is not subject to the supplementary leverage ratio requirement which became effective january however keycorp will be subject to the supplementary leverage ratio if proposed revisions to the regulatory capital rules discussed below are adopted as of december keybank consolidated satisfied the riskbased and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered well capitalized for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework however investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank because the pca framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function moreover it is important to note that the pca framework does not apply to bhcs like keycorp recent regulatory capitalrelated developments in december the basel committee released its final revisions to basel iii the revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of riskweighted assets and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by enhancing the robustness and risksensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk credit valuation adjustment and operational risk constraining the use of internal models by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased approach for credit risk used by advanced approaches banking organizations and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for cva risk and operational risk introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemicallyimportant banks and replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the basel iii standardized approach a final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in february provides banking organizations with the option to phase in over a threeyear period the adverse dayone regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the cecl accounting standard on august the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that gives banking organizations that adopt cecl before the end of the option to delay for two years cecls adverse effects on regulatory capital this is in addition to the threeyear transition period already in place resulting in an optional fiveyear transition key elected to adopt cecl as planned in the first quarter of and exercised the option to use a fiveyear transition to measure cecls effects on regulatory capital on july the federal banking agencies issued a proposal the capital proposal that would make significant changes to the regulatory capital rules applicable to banking organizations with total assets of billion or more and their depository institution subsidiaries large banking organizations including keycorp and keybank and banking organizations with significant trading activity this proposal would implement the final elements of the basel iii capital framework and make other changes to the regulatory capital rules in response to the bank failures that occurred in the capital proposal would establish a new framework for calculating riskweighted assets the expanded riskbased approach that would apply to large banking organizations the expanded riskbased approach would include a new more risksensitive standardized approach for measuring credit risk and operational risk it would also include new standardized approaches for measuring market risk and credit valuation adjustment risk but would allow the use of internal models for market risk in certain circumstances with regulatory approval under the capital proposal a large banking organization would be required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the expanded riskbased approach and the current standardized approach and would use the lower of the two all capital buffer requirements including the stress capital buffer requirement would apply regardless of whether the expanded riskbased approach or the existing standardized approach produces the lower ratio the capital proposal would also align the calculation of regulatory capital for category iii and iv banking organizations with the calculation of regulatory capital for category i and ii banking organizations keycorp and keybank are category iv banking organizations under the proposal category iii and iv banking organizations would be required to include most components of aoci including net unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities in regulatory capital category iii and iv banking organizations would also be required to apply the table of contents same capital deductions and minority interest treatments that currently apply to category i and category ii banking organizations in addition all large banking organizations would be subject to the supplementary leverage ratio and countercyclical capital buffer requirement and would be required to make certain enhanced public disclosures the expanded total riskweighted assets calculation used in the expanded riskbased approach would be phased in over a threeyear period starting on july for category iii and iv banking organizations the requirement to reflect aoci in regulatory capital would also be phased in over a threeyear period starting on july all other elements of the calculation of regulatory capital would apply on the effective date of the final rule which is expected to be on or about july comments on this proposal were due by january liquidity requirements us banking organizations are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the basel committee in and subsequently revised between and as revised the basel iii liquidity framework the basel iii liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned from a balance sheet perspective to satisfy its short and longterm funding needs to address shortterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio basel iii lcr calculated as the ratio of a banking organizations highquality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over consecutive calendar days in addition to address longterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio basel iii nsfr calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding consistent with the basel iii lcr the final rules implementing the basel iii lcr for us banking organizations the liquidity coverage rules established a minimum lcr for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies excluding keycorp and a modified version of the lcr modified lcr for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp under the liquidity coverage rules keycorp was required to calculate a modified lcr on a monthly basis and was required to satisfy a minimum modified lcr requirement of keybank was not subject to the lcr or the modified lcr under the liquidity coverage rules large bhcs like keycorp are also subject to liquidity requirements contained in regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act and the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act egrrcpa as enacted in the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements collectively epss including enhanced liquidity standards upon bhcs like keycorp with at least billion in total consolidated assets egrrcpa enacted on may raised the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply epss to bhcs from billion to billion egrrcpa gave the federal reserve the authority to continue to apply epss to any bhcs having at least billion but less than billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp if it determines that the application of the eps is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the bhc or bhcs taking into consideration the bhcs or bhcs capital structure riskiness complexity financial activities size and other relevant factors as a result of the federal reserves implementation of certain of the epss keycorp is subject to requirements relating to cash flow projections a contingency funding plan liquidity risk limits the monitoring of liquidity risks with respect to collateral legal entities currencies business lines and intraday exposures liquidity stress testing a liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements including requirements that apply to the board of directors the risk committee senior management and the independent review function final rules related to the implementation of egrrcpa tailoring rules became effective on december the tailoring rules established four riskbased categories of banking organizations with billion or more in total consolidated assets and applied tailored regulatory requirements to each respective category based on keys analysis of the tailoring rules keycorp falls within the least restrictive of those categories category iv firms table of contents under one of the tailoring rules category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding of less than billion will not be subject to a reduced lcr keycorp does not meet the billion threshold and is not subject to the reduced lcr or an lcr public disclosure requirement under another tailoring rule category iv firms like keycorp are required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly and are subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements category iv firms are still required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cashflow need over a 30day planning horizon under the firms internal liquidity stress test and remain subject to monthly tailored fr liquidity reporting requirements under the final rules adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the basel iii nsfr for us banking organizations certain banking organizations with more than billion in total assets must maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets commitments and derivatives exposures over a oneyear time horizon under the rules key as a category iv firm with average weighted shortterm wholesale funding of less than billion is not subject to an nsfr requirement capital planning and stress testing the federal reserves capital plan rule requires each usdomiciled toptier bhc with total consolidated assets of at least billion like keycorp to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process the capital plan must be submitted to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with the bhcs ccar described below the supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors including keycorps ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon the federal reserves ccar is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large us bhcs and of the practices these bhcs use to assess their capital needs the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and at the same time be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and provide credit intermediation the federal reserve has conducted a supervisory stress test on keycorp pursuant to which the federal reserve projects revenues expenses losses and resulting poststress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the us economy or the financial condition of keycorp including supervisory baseline and severely adverse scenarios that are determined by the federal reserve keycorp and keybank have also been required to conduct their own companyrun stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios including supervisorprovided baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and for keycorp one keycorpdefined baseline scenario and at least one keycorpdefined stress scenario on their consolidated earnings losses and capital over a ninequarter planning horizon taking into account their current condition risks exposures strategies and activities while keybank has only had to conduct an annual stress test keycorp has had to conduct both an annual and a midcycle stress test keycorp and keybank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the federal reserve and the occ keycorp has been required to report the results of its midcycle stress test to the federal reserve under one of the tailoring rules keycorp is no longer required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of companyrun stress tests and is subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve every other year rather than every year in and again in keycorp was required to participate in the federal reserves ccar process and was subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve in keycorp will again be required to participate in the federal reserves ccar process and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve since the adoption of a final rule by the federal banking agencies in october keybank is no longer required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests also this final rule removes the adverse scenario as a required scenario for all stress testing requirements applicable to bhcs and federallyregulated banks so that such stress tests will be required to include only baseline and severely adverse scenarios on march the federal reserve adopted a final rule integrating certain aspects of the federal reserves regulatory capital rules with ccar and the stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to bhcs that have billion or more in total consolidated assets including keycorp table of contents under the final rule the federal reserve amended the capital conservation buffer requirement under the regulatory capital rules by replacing the static riskweighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure the stress capital buffer which will be based on the results of an individual bhcs supervisory stress test and cannot be less than percent of riskweighted assets a firm will be subject to limitations on capital distributions and

october of each year and will remain in effect until september of the following year unless the firm receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the federal reserve on august the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies regulatory capital rules the revised definition applies to all buffer requirements applicable to a banking organization including the stress capital buffer requirement adopted by the federal reserve on march the revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies capital rules more gradual with the objective of promoting continued lending during a period of stress on january the federal reserve issued a final rule to make conforming changes to the capital planning regulatory reporting and stress capital buffer requirements for firms subject to category iv standards including keycorp to make these requirements consistent with the tailored regulatory framework for large banking organizations that the federal reserve adopted in an october rulemaking the final rule revises the elements of the capital plan that category iv firms are required to submit to the federal reserve and makes related changes to regulatory reporting requirements also the final rule updates the frequency for calculating the stress capital buffer for these firms as a category iv banking organization subject to a supervisory stress test every other year keycorp was not required to participate in the federal reserves supervisory stress test in on july the federal reserve confirmed that keycorps required stress capital buffer based on the results of keycorps june stress test is which is the minimum buffer required for banking organizations the size of keycorp this stress capital buffer requirement will remain in effect until september unless keycorp receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the federal reserve before that date dividend restrictions federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries like keybank historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test without the prior approval of the occ a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current years net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a banks undivided profits moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than adequately capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic similarly under the regulatory capital rules a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations which include restrictions on capital distributions for more information about the payment of dividends by keybank to keycorp please see note restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities in this report fdia resolution authority and financial stability deposit insurance and assessments the dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank the amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositors deposits is per depository the fdic must assess the premium based on an insured depository institutions assessment base calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity keybanks current annualized premium assessments can range from to for each of its assessment base the rate charged depends on table of contents keybanks performance on the fdics large and highly complex institution riskassessment scorecard which includes factors such as keybanks regulatory rating its ability to withstand asset and fundingrelated stress and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybanks failure on october the fdic adopted a final rule applicable to all insured depository institutions including keybank to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by two basis points consistent with the amended restoration plan approved by the fdic on june the fdic indicated that it was taking this action in order to restore the dif reserve ratio to the required statutory minimum of by the statutory deadline of september under the final rule the increase in rates began with the first quarterly assessment period of and will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds in order to support growth in the dif in progressing toward the fdics longterm goal of a reserve ratio on march and march silicon valley bank svb and signature bank signature were closed by the state banking authorities in california and new york respectively and the fdic was appointed as receiver of svb and signature all deposits of svb and signature were transferred to bridge banks established by the fdic under the systemic risk exception to the least cost test in the fdia so that the uninsured deposits as well as the insured deposits of both banks were protected by the fdic under the fdia the loss to the dif arising from the use of the systemic risk exception must be recovered through one or more special assessments on november the fdic issued a final rule to impose a special assessment on idis to recover the loss to the dif resulting from the use of the systemic risk exception to protect the uninsured depositors of svb and signature under the final rule the fdic would collect a special assessment from idis at an annual rate of approximately basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods starting with the first quarterly assessment period of the assessment base for the proposed special assessment is equal to an idis estimated uninsured deposits reported as of december adjusted to exclude the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits held by the idi because the estimated loss to the dif from the use of the systemic risk exception will be periodically adjusted and because the total assessments collected may change due to corrective amendments filed by covered idis regarding the reported amount of uninsured deposits for the december reporting period the fdic may cease collection of the special assessment early extend the special assessment collection period or impose a final shortfall special assessment in the final rule the fdic indicated that the special assessment is a taxdeductible operating expense for idis and that it assumed that the effect on income of the entire amount of the special assessment would occur in one quarter for the idis subject to the assessment the impact of the special assessment to key was approximately million which was recognized upon issuance of the final rule in the fourth quarter of the fdics final rule for a special assessment discussed above was not intended to recover the loss to the dif from the failure of first republic bank in may initially estimated as a billion loss or to the dif from the failures of svb and signature that was not related to the protection of uninsured depositors initially estimated as a billion loss the fdic indicated that no further adjustments to assessments are contemplated at this time to recover those losses but that it will reevaluate this issue in the future when it updates projections for the dif balance and the reserve ratio in connection with its periodic review of the dif restoration plan that was adopted in the fdic updates these projections at least semiannually table of contents conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed as receiver or in rare circumstances conservator for the insolvent institution under the fdia in an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institutions affairs if the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership or conservatorship for breach of contract the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon among other factors the receivership or conservatorship assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others in addition the fdic may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution notwithstanding any provision that would terminate cause a default accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency the appointment of the receiver or conservator or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver or conservator the fdic may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institutions shareholders or creditors these provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of keycorps insured depository institution subsidiary keybank including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors receivership of certain sifis the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime as an alternative to bankruptcy known as the orderly liquidation authority ola for certain sifis including bhcs and their affiliates under the ola the fdic would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing sifi the determination that a sifi should be placed into ola receivership is made by the us treasury secretary who must conclude that the sifi is in default or in danger of default and that the sifis failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the us treasury secretary and the president if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the ola its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the ola the powers of a receiver under the ola are generally based on the fdics powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the fdia certain provisions of the ola were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors claims between the us bankruptcy code and the ola however substantial differences between the two regimes remain including the fdics right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure under ola to determine creditors claims rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy the fdics right to transfer claims to a bridge entity and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual crossdefaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership ola liquidity would be provided through credit support from the us treasury and assessments made first on claimants against the receivership that received more in the ola resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation to the full extent of the excess and second if necessary on sifis like keycorp utilizing a riskbased methodology depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the fdic and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the institutions parent bhc and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment resolution plans bhcs with at least billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp have been required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress insured depository institutions with at least billion in total consolidated assets like keybank have also been required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic these plans have been due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans was deferred by the regulators the federal reserve and fdic make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies including keycorp and keybank that submitted plans the public sections of the resolution plans of keycorp and keybank are available at httpwwwfederalreservegovsupervisionregresolutionplanshtm and table of contents httpswwwfdicgovregulationsreformresplans keycorps last resolution plan was submitted in and keybanks last resolution plan was submitted in keycorp is no longer required to submit a resolution plan because of the rule change discussed below while keybank remains subject to resolution plan requirements as discussed below in october the federal reserve and fdic adopted a final rule to modify the resolution planning requirements applicable to large bhcs under this final rule bhcs with less than billion in total consolidated assets will no longer be required to submit a resolution plan unless they have billion or more in certain riskbased indicators under this final rule keycorp is no longer subject to resolution planning requirements on june the fdic issued a statement describing the modified approach that it plans to take in implementing certain aspects of its resolution plan rule with respect to idis with billion or more in total assets including keybank in this statement the fdic i indicated that these institutions will be required to submit resolution plans on a threeyear cycle ii described the content requirements for these resolution plan submissions and iii specified that there will be greater emphasis in the future on periodic engagement and capabilities testing by the fdic with individual institutions the fdic stated that resolution plans will be submitted in two groups with the first group consisting of idis whose parent company is not a us global systemically important bank gsib or a category ii banking organization and the second group consisting of all other idis with billion or more in total assets keybank is in the first group on august the fdic released for public comment a proposal to amend and restate its current resolution plan rule in order to clarify and strengthen resolution plan submission requirements and reflect lessons learned since the adoption of the fdics current resolution plan rule in among other things the proposal would i require idis with more than billion in total assets including keybank to submit full resolution plans every two years ii require idis with total assets between billion and billion to submit informational filings every two years iii require both groups of filers to submit more limited supplements in the off years iv enhance and clarify the requirements for the content of resolution submissions v codify certain aspects of guidance and feedback provided to filers subject to the current rule vi expand expectations regarding engagement and capabilities testing and vii establish an enhanced credibility standard for the evaluation of resolution submissions comments on the proposal were due by november other regulatory requirements and developments the bank secrecy act the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things maintain a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence and knowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established and maintains an aml program to comply with the bsas requirements consumer financial protection bureau title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than billion like key to carry out federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to keys consumerfacing businesses the doddfrank act also gives the cfpb broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices volcker rule the volcker rule implements section of the doddfrank act which prohibits banking entities such as keycorp keybank and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds referred to as covered funds and engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of financial instruments including securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these instruments table of contents the volcker rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading including transactions in government securities eg us treasuries or any instruments issued by the gnma fnma fhlmc a federal home loan bank or any state or a political division of any state among others transactions in connection with underwriting or marketmaking activities and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers a banking entity may also engage in riskmitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity the banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and if necessary adjusted on an ongoing basis key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading or covered fund restrictions in the volcker rule will have a material impact on its business but it was required to divest certain fund investments as of june key has completed conforming andor divesting certain indirect investments subject to the volcker rule enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements as enacted in the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to impose epss upon bhcs like keycorp with at least billion in total consolidated assets prudential standards were required to include enhanced riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements riskmanagement and risk committee requirements resolution plan requirements credit exposure report requirements single counterparty credit limits sccl supervisory and companyrun stress test requirements and for certain financial companies a debttoequity limit early remediation requirements were required to include limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans capital raising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in later stages of financial decline which would be triggered by forwardlooking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures egrrcpa enacted on may raised the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply epss to bhcs from billion to billion and gave the federal reserve the authority to apply epss to bhcs with at least billion in assets please see the discussion under the headings regulatory capital requirements liquidity requirements and regulatory capital requirements capital planning and stress testing for more information about egrrcpa and the related tailoring rules since the federal rule has implemented the following epss required under the doddfrank act i the resolution plan requirements through a joint final rule adopted with the fdic ii stress test requirements iii the incorporation of the regulatory capital rules through the federal reserves previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests iv liquidity requirements v the risk management framework including requirements around the risk committee and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management and vi a 15to1 debttoequity limit for companies that the fsoc determines pose a grave threat to us financial stability in addition the federal reserve has issued a final rule establishing sccl requirements but that rule does not apply to keycorp the federal reserve has yet to implement a final rule on the early remediation requirements bank transactions with affiliates federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the banks parent bhc and certain companies the parent bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on armslength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the banks regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions significantly restrict the ability of keybank to fund its affiliates including keycorp kbcm and keycorps nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment adviser ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition table of contents these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction these provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them supervision and governance on november the federal reserve announced that it is adopting a new supervisory rating system for large financial institutions including bhcs with total consolidated assets of billion or more like keycorp lfi rating system in order to align the federal reserves rating system with the postcrisis supervisory programs for these firms the lfi rating system will provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions and will assess an institutions capital planning and positions liquidity risk management and positions and governance and controls institutions subject to the lfi rating system will be rated using the following scale broadly meets expectations conditionally meets expectations deficient1 and deficient2 with the conditionally meets expectations rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation the federal reserve assigned an initial rating under the lfi rating system to keycorp in the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system was the subject of two separate but related proposals i proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions and ii proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions the final guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors was issued by the federal reserve on february the federal reserve indicated that it intends to use the board effectiveness guidance in informing its assessment of governance and controls at all firms subject to the lfi rating system including keycorp the federal reserve has not finalized the proposed guidance referenced above regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions this guidance would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system together with the abovementioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firms board of directors community reinvestment act the community reinvestment act cra was enacted in to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve including low and moderateincome lmi neighborhoods consistent with the institutions safe and sound operations the cra requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community including lmi neighborhoods on october the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to strengthen and modernize their regulations implementing the cra to better achieve the purposes of the law adapt to changes in the banking industry and provide clarity and consistency in the application of their regulations among other things the final rule clarifies what activities constitute eligible community development activities adopts four new tests under which large banks with more than billion in assets including keybank will be evaluated applies a new framework for assigning conclusions and ratings to banks updates requirements for delineating facilitybased assessment areas provides for the evaluation of certain large banks in retail lending assessment areas as well as facilitybased assessment areas and imposes new data collection and reporting requirements the four new tests under which large banks will be evaluated are a retail lending test a retail services and products test a community development financing test and a community development services test various metrics and performance standards will be applied under these tests some provisions of the final rule will be effective on april while many other provisions will be effective on january and certain reporting requirements will be effective on january keybank is subject to the final rule table of contents developments relating to climate change on march the sec issued for public comment a proposal to amend its rules under the securities act of and the securities exchange act of to require public companies including keycorp to provide detailed climaterelated information in their registration statements and periodic reports among other things the proposal would require public companies to disclose information about i climaterelated risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the companys business or financial statements over the short medium or longterm ii the actual and potential impacts of such risks on the companys strategy business model and outlook iii the role of the board of directors in overseeing climaterelated risks and managements role in assessing and managing such risks iv the impact of climaterelated events and transitional activities on line items in the companys consolidated financial statements as well as the financial estimates and assumptions used in the financial statements and v the companys direct greenhouse gas emissions indirect emissions from purchased energy and if material indirect emissions from the companys value chain which may include financed emissions in a banks loan portfolio the financial services industry has not yet adopted a standardized methodology for banks to use to quantitatively measure indirect emissions from a banks value chain such as financed emissions accordingly this proposal would require many banks to quantify and disclose financed emissions on a comprehensive scale for the first time we are awaiting issuance of the final rule on october the federal banking agencies issued a set of principles that provide a highlevel framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climaterelated financial risks for financial institutions with over billion in total consolidated assets these principles are intended to provide large financial institutions with guidance in their efforts to identify measure monitor and mitigate physical and transition risks associated with climate change these principles discuss how these risks can be addressed in the following areas governance policies procedures and limits strategic planning risk management data risk measurement and reporting and scenario analysis these principles also describe how climaterelated financial risks can be addressed in connection with various specific risk categories including credit risk liquidity risk operational risk and legalcompliance risk this interagency guidance applies to keycorp and keybank longterm debt requirement on august the federal banking agencies issued for public comment a proposal that would require certain large bhcs and certain large idis to issue and maintain minimum amounts of longterm debt ltd this proposal would apply to category ii iii and iv bhcs including keycorp and idis that i are not consolidated subsidiaries of us global systemically important banks and ii have at least billion in total assets including keybank or are affiliated with an idi that has at least billion in total assets under the proposal the required minimum amount of ltd would be the greater of percent of an entitys total riskweighted assets percent of an entitys average total consolidated assets and percent of an entitys total leverage exposure if it is subject to the supplementary leverage ratio idis that are consolidated subsidiaries of bhcs would be required to issue the ltd to their parent company or another entity that consolidates the idi debt instruments issued to satisfy the minimum ltd requirement would have to meet certain criteria including among other things being unsecured have a remaining maturity of more than one year and not provide the holder with acceleration rights except in limited circumstances bhcs subject to the proposal would also have to comply with certain clean holdingcompany requirements such as a cap on liabilities other than eligible ltd and a prohibition on entering into most qualified financial contracts with third parties the proposal would provide a threeyear transition period with the incremental phasein of the requirements during this period the federal banking agencies indicated that the proposal would improve the resolvability of the covered entities in case of their failure reduce costs to the dif and mitigate contagion and financial stability risks by reducing the risk of loss to uninsured depositors comments on the proposal were due by january debit card interchange fee cap on october the federal reserve issued for public comment a proposal to lower the maximum interchange fee that a debit card issuer with billion or more in total consolidated assets including keybank can receive for a debit card transaction the interchange fee cap is currently set at the sum of  for each transaction plus an amount equal to of the value of the transaction and a one cent fraud prevention adjustment for issuers that satisfy certain criteria in the new proposal the federal reserve proposed to lower the cap to the sum of  for each transaction plus an amount equal to of the value of the transaction and a cent fraud prevention adjustment the federal reserve indicated that it was proposing this revision to the fee table of contents cap to reflect changes in issuer costs the federal reserve also proposed to update the amount of the fee cap every other year going forward by using data it collects in a biennial survey of large debit card issuers comments on the proposal are due by may table of contents
