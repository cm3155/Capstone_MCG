regulation the regulatory framework applicable to bhcs and banks is intended primarily to protect consumers the dif taxpayers and the banking system as a whole rather than to protect the security holders and creditors of financial services companies comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment for financial services companies occurred in and remains ongoing we cannot predict changes in applicable laws regulations or regulatory agency policies but any such changes may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations or access to liquidity or credit overview federal law establishes a system of regulation under which the federal reserve is the umbrella regulator for bhcs while their subsidiaries are principally regulated by prudential or functional regulators i the occ for national banks and federal savings associations ii the fdic for state nonmember banks and savings associations iii the federal reserve for state member banks iv the cfpb for consumer financial products or services v the sec and finra for securities brokerdealer activities vi the sec cftc and nfa for swaps and other derivatives and vii state insurance regulators for insurance activities certain specific activities including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a broker or a dealer in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation under the bhca bhcs generally may not directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank without prior approval from the federal reserve in addition bhcs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities however a bhc that satisfies certain requirements regarding management capital adequacy and community reinvestment act performance may elect to be treated as a financial holding company fhc for purposes of federal law and as a result may engage in a substantially broader scope of activities that are considered to be financial in nature or complementary to those activities keycorp has elected to be treated as a fhc and as such is authorized to engage in securities underwriting and dealing insurance agency and underwriting and merchant banking activities in addition the federal reserve has permitted fhcs like keycorp to engage in the following activities under the view that such activities are complementary to a financial activity physical commodities trading activities energy management services and energy tolling among others under federal law a bhc also must serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions by providing financial assistance in the event of financial distress this support may be required when the bhc does not have the resources to or would prefer not to provide it certain loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in and certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank in addition federal law provides that in the bankruptcy of a bhc any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment the doddfrank act created the fsoc to overlay the us supervisory framework for bhcs insured depository institutions and other financial service providers by serving as a systemic risk oversight body specifically the fsoc is authorized to i identify risks to us financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure or ongoing activities of large interconnected sifis or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace ii promote market discipline by eliminating expectations that the us government will shield shareholders creditors and counterparties from losses in the event of failure and iii respond to emerging threats to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc is responsible for facilitating regulatory coordination information collection and sharing designating nonbank financial companies for consolidated supervision by the federal reserve designating systemic financial market utilities and systemic payment clearing and settlement activities requiring prescribed risk management standards and heightened federal regulatory oversight recommending stricter standards for sifis and together with the federal reserve determining whether action should be taken to break up firms that pose a grave threat to us financial stability as a fhc keycorp is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve under the bhca our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ at december we operated one fullservice fdicinsured national bank subsidiary keybank and one national bank subsidiary that is limited to fiduciary activities the fdic also has certain more limited regulatory supervisory and examination authority over keybank and keycorp under the fdia and the doddfrank act table of contents we have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve as well as other state and federal regulatory agencies and selfregulatory organizations because keybank engages in derivative transactions in it provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the cftc and became a member of the nfa the selfregulatory organization for participants in the us derivatives industry our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the sec finra and state securities regulators and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business regulatory capital requirements background keycorp and keybank are subject to regulatory capital requirements that are based largely on the work of an international group of supervisors known as the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee the basel committee is responsible for establishing international bank supervisory standards for implementation in member jurisdictions to enhance and align bank regulation on a global scale and to promote financial stability the regulatory capital framework developed by the basel committee and implemented in the united states is a predominately riskbased capital framework that establishes minimum capital requirements based on the amount of regulatory capital a banking organization maintains relative to the amount of its total assets adjusted to reflect credit risk riskweighted assets each banking organization subject to this regulatory capital framework is required to satisfy certain minimum riskbased capital measures eg a tier riskbased capital ratio requirement of tier capital to total riskweighted assets and in the united states a minimum leverage ratio requirement of tier capital to average total onbalance sheet assets which serves as a backstop to the riskbased measures a capital instrument is assigned to one of two tiers based on the relative strength and ability of that instrument to absorb credit losses on a going concern basis capital instruments with relatively robust lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier while other capital instruments with relatively less lossabsorption capacity are assigned to tier a banking organizations total capital equals the sum of its tier and tier capital the basel committee also developed a market risk capital framework that also has been implemented in the united states to address the substantial exposure to market risk faced by banking organizations with significant trading activity and augment the credit riskbased capital requirements described above for example the minimum total riskbased capital ratio requirement for a banking organization subject to the market risk capital rule equals the ratio of the banking organizations total capital to the sum of its credit riskweighted assets and market riskweighted assets only keycorp is subject to the market risk capital rule as keybank does not engage in substantial trading activity basel iii to address deficiencies in the international regulatory capital standards identified during the global financial crisis in the basel committee released comprehensive revisions to the international regulatory capital framework commonly referred to as basel iii the basel iii revisions are designed to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital in part through the introduction of a common equity tier capital requirement provide more comprehensive and robust risk coverage particularly for securitization exposures equities and offbalance sheet positions and address procyclicality concerns through the implementation of capital buffers the basel committee also released a series of revisions to the market risk capital framework to address deficiencies identified during its initial implementation eg arbitrage opportunities between the credit riskbased and market risk capital rules and in connection with the global financial crisis keycorp and keybank are subject to regulatory capital requirements implemented by the us banking agencies that are based largely on basel iii regulatory capital rules consistent with the international framework the regulatory capital rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in tier and tier capital establish a minimum common equity tier capital ratio requirement of and capital buffers to absorb losses during periods of financial stress while allowing an institution to provide credit intermediation as it would during a normal economic environment and refine several of the methodologies used for determining riskweighted assets the regulatory capital rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over billion in total consolidated assets or billion in foreign exposure but those additional requirements do not apply to keycorp or keybank accordingly for purposes of the regulatory capital rules keycorp and keybank are treated as standardized approach banking organizations table of contents under the regulatory capital rules standardized approach banking organizations such as keycorp and keybank are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table at december keycorps ratios under the fully phasedin regulatory capital rules are set forth in the following table minimum capital ratios and keycorp ratios under regulatory capital rules table start ratios including stress capital buffer regulatory minimum requirement stress capital buffer b regulatory minimum with stress capital buffer keycorp december c common equity tier tier capital total capital leverage a na table end a as a standardized approach banking organization keycorp is not subject to the supplemental leverage ratio requirement which became effective january b stress capital buffer must consist of common equity tier capital as a standardized approach banking organization keycorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the regulatory capital rules c ratios reflect the fiveyear transition of cecl impacts on regulatory ratios revised prompt corrective action framework the federal prompt corrective action framework established under the fdia groups fdicinsured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized in addition to implementing the basel iii capital framework in the us the regulatory capital rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to fdicinsured depository institutions such as keybank with an effective date of january the revised prompt corrective action framework table below identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action framework well capitalized and adequately capitalized capital category ratios under revised prompt corrective action framework table start prompt corrective action capital category ratio well capitalized a adequately capitalized common equity tier riskbased tier riskbased total riskbased tier leverage b table end a a well capitalized institution also must not be subject to any written agreement order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure b as a standardized approach banking organization keybank is not subject to the supplemental leverage ratio requirement which became effective january we believe that as of december keybank consolidated satisfied the riskbased and leverage capital requirements necessary to be considered well capitalized for purposes of the revised prompt corrective action framework however investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of keybank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function moreover it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to bhcs like keycorp recent regulatory capitalrelated developments in december the basel committee released its final revisions to basel iii the revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of riskweighted assets rwas and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations by enhancing the robustness and risksensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk credit valuation adjustment and operational risk constraining the use of internal models by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased approach for credit risk used by advanced approaches banking organizations and removing the ability to use an internal model for purposes of determining the capital charge for credit valuation adjustment cva risk and operational risk introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemicallyimportant banks and replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the basel iii standardized approach the us federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the basel committees efforts but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the regulatory capital table of contents rules and that any proposed changes based on the basel committee revisions would be subject to noticeandcomment rulemaking in view of the prohibition under the doddfrank act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratingsbased aspects of the basel committee revisions to basel iii as well as any other aspect of the basel committee revisions that permit the us agencies to exercise homecountry discretion for example due to differences in accounting or market practices and legal requirements subsequently in december the basel committee released an update to its pillar disclosure framework to more appropriately align it to the changes adopted under the basel committees final revisions to basel iii before any action is taken by the federal banking agencies with respect to the revised pillar disclosure framework the federal agencies must determine whether and to what extent they will implement the final revisions to basel iii released by the basel committee in december on july the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to simplify certain aspects of the regulatory capital rules for standardized approach banking organizations including key the final rule simplifies for these banking organizations the regulatory capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions the final rule replaces multiple deduction thresholds with a single deduction threshold for each of these categories and requires that a risk weight be applied to mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital the final rule also simplifies the calculation of the amount of capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties that is includable in regulatory capital in addition the final rule makes certain technical amendments to the regulatory capital rules that are applicable to standardized approach banking organizations as well as advanced approaches banking organizations the final rule provided an effective date of october for the technical amendments and an effective date of april for the simplification changes on november the federal banking agencies published an amendment to the final rule to provide standardized approach banking organizations with the option to implement the simplification changes on either january or april we chose to implement the simplification changes on april in november the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to amend the regulatory capital rules by revising the definition of a high volatility commercial real estate hvcre exposure hvcre exposures are subject to a heightened risk weight under the regulatory capital rules the final rule which became effective on april conforms the hvcre definition to statutory changes enacted in may the final rule also clarifies the treatment under the revised hvcre definition of credit facilities that finance onetofour family residential properties as well as credit facilities that finance the development of land a final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in february provides banking organizations with the option to phase in over a threeyear period the adverse dayone regulatory capital effects of the adoption of the cecl accounting standard on march the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that gives banking organizations that are required under us accounting standards to adopt cecl before the end of the option to delay for two years cecls adverse effects on regulatory capital cecl interim final rule this is in addition to the threeyear transition period already in place resulting in an optional fiveyear transition the agencies noted that this relief is being provided in order to allow banking organizations to better focus on lending to creditworthy households and businesses affected by recent strains on the us economy caused by covid19 the cares act enacted on march provides banking organizations with the option to not comply with cecl until the earlier of i the termination date of the national emergency concerning covid19 declared by the president under the national emergencies act or ii december the federal banking agencies issued a statement on march indicating that banking organizations that elect to use the optional temporary statutory relief will be able to elect the remaining period of regulatory capital relief provided under the cecl interim final rule after the end of the statutory relief period alternatively banking organizations may adopt cecl as planned in and use the regulatory capital relief provided under the cecl interim final rule starting at the time of their adoption of cecl on august the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that is substantially similar to the cecl interim final rule like the cecl interim final rule the final rule gives eligible banking organizations the option to mitigate the estimated adverse effects on regulatory capital of cecl for two years followed by a threeyear transition period which results in an optional fiveyear transition the final rule expands the group of institutions eligible for this optional fiveyear transition to include any institution adopting cecl in the final rule also includes certain minor adjustments to clarify the calculation of the transitional amount key elected to adopt cecl as planned in the table of contents first quarter of and exercise the option to use a fiveyear transition to measure cecls effects on regulatory capital liquidity requirements us banking organizations are subject to regulatory liquidity requirements based on international liquidity standards established by the basel committee in and subsequently revised between and as revised the basel iii liquidity framework the basel iii liquidity framework establishes quantitative standards designed to ensure that a banking organization is appropriately positioned from a balance sheet perspective to satisfy its short and longterm funding needs to address shortterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a liquidity coverage ratio basel iii lcr calculated as the ratio of a banking organizations highquality liquid assets to its total net cash outflows over consecutive calendar days in addition to address longterm liquidity risk the basel iii liquidity framework established a net stable funding ratio basel iii nsfr calculated as the ratio of the amount of stable funding available to a banking organization to its required amount of stable funding in october the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the basel iii lcr for us banking organizations the liquidity coverage rules consistent with the basel iii lcr the us liquidity coverage rules established a minimum lcr for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies excluding keycorp and a modified version of the lcr modified lcr for bhcs and other depository institution holding companies with over billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active including keycorp under the liquidity coverage rules keycorp was required to calculate a modified lcr on a monthly basis and was required to satisfy a minimum modified lcr requirement of keybank was not subject to the lcr or the modified lcr under the liquidity coverage rules in december the federal reserve adopted a final rule to implement public disclosure requirements for the lcr and modified lcr under the final rule each calendar quarter keycorp was required to publicly disclose certain quantitative information regarding its modified lcr calculation together with a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on its modified lcr keycorp began complying with these disclosure requirements for the calendar quarter beginning october large bhcs like keycorp are also subject to liquidity requirements contained in regulations adopted pursuant to the doddfrank act and the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act egrrcpa as enacted in the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements collectively epss including enhanced liquidity standards upon bhcs like keycorp with at least billion in total consolidated assets in march the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the epss required under the doddfrank act including liquidity requirements relating to cash flow projections a contingency funding plan liquidity risk limits the monitoring of liquidity risks with respect to collateral legal entities currencies business lines and intraday exposures liquidity stress testing a liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements including requirements that apply to the board of directors the risk committee senior management and the independent review function keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january egrrcpa enacted on may raised the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply epss to bhcs from billion to billion egrrcpa gave the federal reserve the authority following notice and comment procedures to continue to apply epss to any bhcs having at least billion but less than billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp if it determines that the application of the eps is appropriate to prevent or mitigate risks to financial stability or to promote the safety and soundness of the bhc or bhcs taking into consideration the bhcs or bhcs capital structure riskiness complexity financial activities size and other relevant factors in october the federal banking agencies issued two final rules related to the implementation of egrrcpa tailoring rules the final rules established four riskbased categories of banking organizations with billion or more in total consolidated assets and applied tailored regulatory requirements to each respective category based on keys analysis of the tailoring rules keycorp falls within the least restrictive of those categories category iv firms the tailoring rules became effective on december table of contents in one of the tailoring rules the federal banking agencies amended various rules including the rules governing standardized liquidity requirements thereby applying tailored liquidity requirements to large banking organizations in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules under this final rule category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding of less than billion will not be subject to a reduced lcr keycorp does not meet the billion threshold and is not subject to the reduced lcr or an lcr public disclosure requirement in the other tailoring rule the federal reserve amended certain of its rules governing epss to apply tailored regulatory standards including liquidity standards to large bhcs in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules under this rule category iv firms like keycorp are required to conduct internal liquidity stress tests quarterly rather than monthly as was previously the case and are subject to simplified liquidity risk management requirements including requirements to adopt a set of liquidity risk limits that is more limited than previously required calculate collateral positions monthly rather than weekly and monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures category iv firms are still required to maintain a liquidity buffer that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cashflow need over a 30day planning horizon under the firms internal liquidity stress test and remain subject to monthly tailored fr liquidity reporting requirements on october the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement the basel iii nsfr for us banking organizations the nsfr final rule which became effective on july requires certain banking organizations with more than billion in total assets to maintain minimum amounts of stable funding to support their assets commitments and derivatives exposures over a oneyear time horizon the final nsfr rule tailors the application of the nsfr requirement to large banking organizations in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions established by the tailoring rules key is a category iv firm category iv firms with average weighted shortterm wholesale funding of less than billion will not be subject to an nsfr requirement key does not meet the billion threshold and is not subject to an nsfr requirement on december the federal reserve published revisions to the fr liquidity reporting form in order to accurately reflect the nsfr final rule and to capture other data elements necessary to monitor banking organizations liquidity positions and compliance with liquidity risk management standards the revisions were effective on may for category i firms and on october for category ii iii and iv firms including keycorp capital planning and stress testing the federal reserves capital plan rule requires each usdomiciled toptier bhc with total consolidated assets of at least billion like keycorp to develop and maintain a written capital plan supported by a robust internal capital adequacy process the capital plan must be submitted to the federal reserve for supervisory review in connection with the bhcs ccar described below the supervisory review includes an assessment of many factors including keycorps ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon the federal reserves ccar is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of large us bhcs and of the practices these bhcs use to assess their capital needs the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar to have and maintain regulatory capital in an amount that is sufficient to withstand a severely adverse operating environment and at the same time be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and provide credit intermediation the federal reserve has conducted a supervisory stress test on keycorp pursuant to which the federal reserve projects revenues expenses losses and resulting poststress capital levels and regulatory capital ratios under conditions that affect the us economy or the financial condition of keycorp including supervisory baseline and severely adverse scenarios and through an adverse scenario that are determined by the federal reserve keycorp and keybank have also been required to conduct their own companyrun stress tests to assess the impact of stress scenarios including supervisorprovided baseline adverse and severely adverse scenarios and for keycorp one keycorpdefined baseline scenario and at least one keycorpdefined stress scenario on their consolidated earnings losses and capital over a ninequarter planning horizon taking into account their current condition risks exposures strategies and activities while keybank has only had to conduct an annual stress test keycorp has had to conduct both an annual and a midcycle stress test keycorp and keybank have been required to report the results of their annual stress tests to the federal reserve and the occ keycorp has been required to report the results of its midcycle stress test to the federal reserve summaries of the results of these companyrun table of contents stress tests through keycorps midcycle stress test results have been disclosed under the regulatory disclosures filings section of the financials tab of keys investor relations website httpwwwkeycomir such summaries were not disclosed after because of the rule changes discussed below one of the tailoring rules issued by the federal reserve in october to implement egrrcpa changes the stress testing requirements applicable to bhcs that are category iv firms like keycorp under this rule category iv firms will no longer be required to conduct and publicly disclose the results of companyrun stress tests and will be subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve every other year rather than every year as has been the case in and again in keycorp was required to participate in the federal reserves ccar process and was subject to a supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve a separate rule was issued by the federal banking agencies in october to implement a provision in egrrcpa that raised the asset threshold that triggers the requirement for federallyregulated banks to conduct companyrun stress tests on an annual basis from billion to billion in total consolidated assets under this final rule federallyregulated banks with total assets of less than billion like keybank will no longer be required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests also this final rule removes the adverse scenario as a required scenario for all stress testing requirements applicable to bhcs and federallyregulated banks so that such stress tests will be required to include only baseline and severely adverse scenarios on march the federal reserve adopted a final rule integrating certain aspects of the federal reserves regulatory capital rules with ccar and the stress test rules in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to bhcs that have billion or more in total consolidated assets including keycorp under the final rule the federal reserve amended the capital conservation buffer requirement under the regulatory capital rules by replacing the static riskweighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure the stress capital buffer which will be based on the results of an individual bhcs supervisory stress test and cannot be less than percent of riskweighted assets a firm will be subject to limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it does not satisfy all minimum capital requirements and its stress capital buffer requirement a firms stress capital buffer requirement will become effective on october of each year and will remain in effect until september of the following year unless the firm receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the federal reserve on march the federal banking agencies published an interim final rule that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies regulatory capital rules the revised definition applies to all buffer requirements applicable to a banking organization including the stress capital buffer requirement adopted by the federal reserve on march the revised definition of eligible retained income will make any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply under the agencies capital rules more gradual with the objective of promoting continued lending during a period of stress including the period of stress resulting from the covid19 pandemic on august the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that adopts without change the interim final rule issued in march that revises the definition of eligible retained income as that term is used in the agencies regulatory capital rules on june the federal reserve publicly announced the results of its ccar process and the supervisory stress test that it conducted of bhcs having more than billion in total consolidated assets including keycorp the federal reserve indicated that it planned to use the results of this stress test to set the new stress capital buffer requirement for these firms which would take effect in the fourth quarter of the federal reserve also announced the results of a sensitivity analysis it conducted to assess the resiliency of these firms under three hypothetical downside scenarios which could result from the covid19 disruptions as a result of its sensitivity analysis the federal reserve decided to take certain actions to require large banking organizations to preserve capital and reevaluate their capital plans specifically the federal reserve stated that it was requiring each firm subject to its capital plan rule to update and resubmit its capital plan to the appropriate reserve bank the federal reserve further indicated that for the third quarter of these firms were prohibited from i making share repurchases other than share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock for employee stock ownership plans and ii paying common stock dividends that exceed the amount paid in the second quarter of or exceed an amount equal to the average of the firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters unless otherwise specified by the federal reserve the federal reserve extended these restrictions with some modifications into the fourth quarter of and the first two quarters of on june keycorp announced that its preliminary stress capital requirement provided by the federal reserve as part of the federal reserve capital stress testing exercise is which represents the minimum table of contents buffer required for banking organizations the size of key in august the federal reserve confirmed that keycorps required stress capital buffer based on its june stress test is on december the federal reserve announced the results of the second round of stress tests for that it conducted on large banking organizations including keycorp the federal reserve indicated that in the aggregate capital ratios for the firms subject to the stress tests remained well above their required minimum levels throughout the projection horizon under both the severely adverse and alternative severe scenarios on march the federal reserve said that the temporary additional restrictions on dividends and share repurchases that it had imposed on large bhcs would end after june beginning on july these firms including keycorp are allowed to make capital distributions that are consistent with the regulatory capital rules inclusive of the stress capital buffer requirement in august the federal reserve reconfirmed that keycorps required stress capital buffer is which is the minimum buffer requirement for firms the size of keycorp on january the federal reserve issued a final rule to make conforming changes to the capital planning regulatory reporting and stress capital buffer requirements for firms subject to category iv standards including keycorp to make these requirements consistent with the tailored regulatory framework for large banking organizations that the federal reserve adopted in an october rulemaking the final rule revises the elements of the capital plan that category iv firms are required to submit to the federal reserve and makes related changes to regulatory reporting requirements also the final rule updates the frequency for calculating the stress capital buffer for these firms in addition the final rule makes certain clarifying changes to the stress testing rules applicable to all large banking organizations on june the federal reserve announced the results of the supervisory stress test that it conducted of bhcs having more than billion in total consolidated assets including keycorp the federal reserve indicated that all bhcs subject to the stress test maintained capital ratios above the minimum required levels under the severely adverse scenario the stress test results for individual bhcs will be used to determine a bhcs stress capital buffer requirement which became effective on october and will remain in effect until september unless the firm later receives an updated stress capital buffer requirement from the federal reserve on august the federal reserve confirmed that keycorps required stress capital buffer based on its june stress test is which is the minimum buffer required for banking organizations the size of keycorp dividend restrictions federal law and regulation impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries like keybank historically dividends paid by keybank have been an important source of cash flow for keycorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt dividends by our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test under the earnings retention test without the prior approval of the occ a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current years net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of a banks undivided profits moreover under the fdia an insured depository institution may not pay a dividend if the payment would cause it to be less than adequately capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework or if the institution is in default in the payment of an assessment due to the fdic similarly under the regulatory capital rules a banking organization that fails to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement will be subject to certain limitations which include restrictions on capital distributions for more information about the payment of dividends by keybank to keycorp please see note restrictions on cash dividends and lending activities in this report fdia resolution authority and financial stability deposit insurance and assessments the dif provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits funded through assessments on insured depository institutions like keybank the amount of deposit insurance coverage for each depositors deposits is per depository table of contents the fdic must assess the premium based on an insured depository institutions assessment base calculated as its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity keybanks current annualized premium assessments can range from to for each of its assessment base the rate charged depends on keybanks performance on the fdics large and highly complex institution riskassessment scorecard which includes factors such as keybanks regulatory rating its ability to withstand asset and fundingrelated stress and the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of keybanks failure in december the fdic issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts including keybank to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if such an institution were to fail the rule requires those insured depository institutions to i maintain complete and accurate data on each depositors ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institutions deposit accounts and ii develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within hours of failure the fdic will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the fdic a certification of compliance signed by the banks ceo and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter the final rule became effective on april with a mandatory compliance date of april on july the fdic approved amendments that revise certain aspects of this rule among other things the amendments to this rule i provide covered institutions with the option to extend the compliance date to no later than april upon notification to the fdic ii clarify the certification requirement iii revise the actions that must be taken for deposit accounts insured on a passthrough basis where the banks account holder is holding funds on behalf of the beneficial owners of the funds and iv streamline the process for submitting exception requests to the fdic on october the fdic adopted a final rule applicable to all insured depository institutions to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by two basis points consistent with the amended restoration plan approved by the fdic on june the fdic indicated that it was taking this action in order to restore the dif reserve ratio to the required statutory minimum of by the statutory deadline of september the fdic said that the reserve ratio had declined below this level because of the increase in insured deposits since the start of the pandemic and other factors that affect the level of the dif under the final rule the increase in rates will begin with the first quarterly assessment period of and will remain in effect unless and until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds in order to support growth in the dif in progressing toward the fdics longterm goal of a reserve ratio the increase in assessment rates will apply to keybank conservatorship and receivership of insured depository institutions upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution the fdic will be appointed as receiver or in rare circumstances conservator for the insolvent institution under the fdia in an insolvency the fdic may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which the institution is a party if the fdic determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome and that disaffirming or repudiating the contract would promote orderly administration of the institutions affairs if the contractual counterparty made a claim against the receivership or conservatorship for breach of contract the amount paid to the counterparty would depend upon among other factors the receivership or conservatorship assets available to pay the claim and the priority of the claim relative to others in addition the fdic may enforce most contracts entered into by the insolvent institution notwithstanding any provision that would terminate cause a default accelerate or give other rights under the contract solely because of the insolvency the appointment of the receiver or conservator or the exercise of rights or powers by the receiver or conservator the fdic may also transfer any asset or liability of the insolvent institution without obtaining approval or consent from the institutions shareholders or creditors these provisions would apply to obligations and liabilities of keycorps insured depository institution subsidiaries such as keybank including obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued to public investors receivership of certain sifis the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime as an alternative to bankruptcy known as the orderly liquidation authority ola for certain sifis including bhcs and their affiliates under the ola the fdic would generally be appointed as receiver to liquidate and wind down a failing sifi the determination that a sifi should be placed into ola receivership is made by the us treasury secretary who must conclude that the sifi is in default or in danger of default and that the sifis failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system this determination must come after supermajority recommendations by the federal reserve and the fdic and consultation between the us treasury secretary and the president table of contents if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the ola its powers and the rights and obligations of creditors and other relevant parties would be determined exclusively under the ola the powers of a receiver under the ola are generally based on the fdics powers as receiver for insured depository institutions under the fdia certain provisions of the ola were modified to reduce disparate treatment of creditors claims between the us bankruptcy code and the ola however substantial differences between the two regimes remain including the fdics right to disregard claim priority in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure under ola to determine creditors claims rather than a judicial procedure in bankruptcy the fdics right to transfer claims to a bridge entity and limitations on the ability of creditors to enforce contractual crossdefaults against potentially viable affiliates of the entity in receivership ola liquidity would be provided through credit support from the us treasury and assessments made first on claimants against the receivership that received more in the ola resolution than they would have received in ordinary liquidation to the full extent of the excess and second if necessary on sifis like keycorp utilizing a riskbased methodology depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of its depositors including claims of its depositors that have subrogated to the fdic and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver have priority over other general unsecured claims if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will be placed ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the institutions parent bhc and subordinated creditors in order of priority of payment resolution plans bhcs with at least billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp have been required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and fdic a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and orderly resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress insured depository institutions with at least billion in total consolidated assets like keybank have also been required to submit a resolution plan to the fdic these plans have been due annually unless the requirement to submit the plans was deferred by the regulators the federal reserve and fdic make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies including keycorp and keybank that submitted plans the public sections of the resolution plans of keycorp and keybank are available at httpwwwfederalreservegovsupervisionregresolutionplanshtm and httpswwwfdicgovregulationsreformresplans keycorps last resolution plan was submitted in and keybanks last resolution plan was submitted in keycorp is no longer required to submit a resolution plan because of the rule change discussed below while keybank remains subject to resolution plan requirements as discussed below in october the federal reserve and fdic adopted a final rule to modify the resolution planning requirements applicable to large bhcs under this final rule bhcs with less than billion in total consolidated assets will no longer be required to submit a resolution plan unless they have billion or more in certain riskbased indicators under this final rule keycorp is no longer subject to resolution planning requirements on april the fdic issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr requesting public comment on potential changes to its rule imposing resolution planning requirements on large insured depository institutions including potential modifications to the rule in the following areas i creation of tiered resolution planning requirements based on institution size complexity and other factors ii revisions to the frequency and required content of plan submissions including elimination of plan submissions for a category of smaller and less complex institutions iii improvements to the process for periodic engagements between the fdic and institutions on resolutionrelated matters and iv revision of the billion asset threshold in the current rule the fdic indicated that it is considering two alternate approaches with respect to the tiering of resolution plan requirements under each of these approaches institutions would be placed into three groups with the first two groups required to submit resolution plans with streamlined content requirements and the third group not required to submit a resolution plan the fdic would engage with institutions in all three groups on a periodic basis on a limited number of items related to resolution planning and would conduct periodic testing of the resolution planning capabilities of these institutions comments on this anpr were due by june any changes to this rule will impact keybank the fdic extended the due date for the next resolution plan submission for all institutions until after the rulemaking is completed table of contents on january the fdic issued a statement announcing that it will resume requiring insured depository institutions with billion or more in assets to submit resolution plans the fdic said that it intends to streamline resolution plan content requirements and emphasize periodic engagement with firms regarding resolution planning issues the fdic further indicated that no firm will be required to submit a plan without at least twelve months advance notice being provided to the firm on june the fdic issued a statement describing the modified approach that it plans to take in implementing certain aspects of its resolution plan rule with respect to idis with billion or more in total assets including keybank in this statement the fdic i indicated that these institutions will be required to submit resolution plans on a threeyear cycle ii described the content requirements for these resolution plan submissions and iii specified that there will be greater emphasis in the future on periodic engagement and capabilities testing by the fdic with individual institutions a key goal of the fdics modified approach is to provide the fdic with the information that it will need to meet the operational challenges of resolving an institution in a way that best preserves value and minimizes disruptions the fdic stated that resolution plans will be submitted in two groups with the first group consisting of idis whose parent company is not a us global systemically important bank gsib or a category ii banking organization and the second group consisting of all other idis with billion or more in total assets keybank is in the first group on october and october the federal reserve and the fdic issued an anpr requesting public comment on the potential adoption of new resolutionrelated resource requirements for large banking organizations that are not gsibs the new requirements would potentially include a longterm debt requirement that would provide an extra layer of lossabsorbing capacity a cleanholding company requirement prohibiting certain financial arrangements such as shortterm borrowings or derivatives and a requirement for the identification of separability options in the context of recovery or resolution the federal reserve and the fdic stated that large banking organizations for this purpose are those banking organizations that have billion or more in total consolidated assets and are not gsibs but indicated that the focus of this anpr was on category ii and category iii banking organizations which are banking organizations with billion or more in total consolidated assets or that meet certain riskbased criteria keycorp is a category iv banking organization and would not be subject to the potential new requirements unless they are extended to category iv banking organizations comments on the anpr were due by december the federal reserve and the fdic extended the due date for comments to january other regulatory developments the bank secrecy act the bsa requires all financial institutions including banks and securities brokerdealers to among other things maintain a riskbased system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism it includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as cash and suspicious activity reporting as well as due diligence and knowyourcustomer documentation requirements key has established and maintains an aml program to comply with the bsas requirements consumer financial protection bureau title x of the doddfrank act created the cfpb a consumer financial services regulator with supervisory authority over banks and their affiliates with assets of more than billion like key to carry out federal consumer protection laws the cfpb also regulates financial products and services sold to consumers and has rulemaking authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the cfpb or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to keys consumerfacing businesses the doddfrank act also gives the cfpb broad data collecting powers for fair lending for both small business and mortgage loans as well as extensive authority to prevent unfair deceptive and abusive practices volcker rule the volcker rule implements section of the doddfrank act which prohibits banking entities such as keycorp keybank and their affiliates and subsidiaries from owning sponsoring or having certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds referred to as covered funds and engaging in shortterm proprietary trading of financial instruments including securities derivatives commodity futures and options on these instruments table of contents the volcker rule excepts certain transactions from the general prohibition against proprietary trading including transactions in government securities eg us treasuries or any instruments issued by the gnma fnma fhlmc a federal home loan bank or any state or a political division of any state among others transactions in connection with underwriting or marketmaking activities and transactions as a fiduciary on behalf of customers a banking entity may also engage in riskmitigating hedging activity if it can demonstrate that the hedge reduces or mitigates a specific identifiable risk or aggregate risk position of the entity the banking entity is required to conduct an analysis supporting its hedging strategy and the effectiveness of the hedges must be monitored and if necessary adjusted on an ongoing basis although the volcker rule became effective on april the federal reserve exercised its unilateral authority to extend the compliance deadline until july with respect to covered funds in addition on december the federal reserve released additional guidelines regarding how banking entities may seek an extension of the conformance period for certain legacy covered fund investments under the doddfrank act the federal reserve is authorized to provide a banking entity up to an additional five years to conform legacy investments ie contractual commitments of a banking organization on or before may to make an investment in illiquid covered funds key does not anticipate that the proprietary trading restrictions in the volcker rule will have a material impact on its business but it may be required to divest certain fund investments as discussed in more detail in note fair value measurements in item of this report on january key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investments are conformed or are expected to mature or july the application for an extension was approved on february this time period was subsequently extended to july as of december we have not committed to sell these investments therefore these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology on october five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to simplify and tailor requirements relating to the volcker rule among other things the final rule i revises the definition of certain terms relevant in determining the scope of the volcker rule ii modifies the eligibility criteria for a banking entity to be able to rely on certain exemptions and exclusions from the proprietary trading and covered fund prohibitions iii adds additional proprietary trading exclusions and iv tailors the rules compliance requirements based on the size of a firms trading assets and liabilities under the final rule a banking entity is subject to the most stringent compliance requirements if it has significant trading assets and liabilities that is total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of at least billion a banking entity with total consolidated trading assets and liabilities between billion and billion is regarded as having moderate trading assets and liabilities and is subject to a requirement to have a simplified compliance program that must be appropriate given that banking entitys activities size scope and complexity a presumption of compliance applies to a banking entity with limited trading assets and liabilities that is total consolidated trading assets and liabilities of less than billion the final rule rule became effective on january and the compliance date was january key has moderate trading assets and liabilities as calculated under the final rule the final rule did not have a material impact on keys operations on june five federal agencies announced their adoption of a final rule to clarify and streamline the covered fundrelated provisions of the volcker rule among other things the final rule i permits certain lowrisk transactions including intraday credit riskless principal and payment clearing and settlement transactions between a banking entity and covered funds for which the banking entity serves as the investment adviser investment manager or sponsor ii clarifies exclusions from the covered fund definition for foreign public funds loan securitizations small business investment companies and public welfare investment funds and iii permits banking entities to invest in or sponsor certain types of funds that do not raise the concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address such as credit funds venture capital funds customer facilitation funds and family wealth management vehicles the final rule became effective on october enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements as enacted in the doddfrank act required the federal reserve to impose epss upon bhcs like keycorp with at least billion in total consolidated assets prudential standards were required to include enhanced riskbased capital requirements and leverage limits liquidity requirements riskmanagement and risk committee requirements resolution plan requirements credit exposure report requirements single counterparty credit limits sccl supervisory and companyrun stress test requirements and for certain financial companies a debtto table of contents equity limit early remediation requirements were required to include limits on capital distributions acquisitions and asset growth in early stages of financial decline and capital restoration plans capital raising requirements limits on transactions with affiliates management changes and asset sales in later stages of financial decline which would be triggered by forwardlooking indicators including regulatory capital and liquidity measures the resolution plan requirements were implemented by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in and were revised by a joint final rule adopted by the federal reserve and fdic in in the federal reserve also issued a proposal to implement the stress test early remediation and sccl requirements however when that proposal was adopted as a final rule in it included only the stress test requirements and not the sccl or early remediation requirements in march the federal reserve published a final rule to implement certain of the epss required under the doddfrank act including i the incorporation of the regulatory capital rules through the federal reserves previously finalized rules on capital planning and stress tests ii liquidity requirements iii the risk management framework the risk committee and the chief risk officer as well as the corporate governance requirements as they relate to liquidity risk management and iv a 15to1 debttoequity limit for companies that the fsoc determines pose a grave threat to us financial stability keycorp was required to comply with the final rule starting on january egrrcpa which was enacted on may raised from billion to billion the asset threshold above which the federal reserve is required to apply epss to bhcs egrrcpa gave the federal reserve the authority following notice and comment procedures to continue to apply epss to any bhcs having at least billion but less than billion in total consolidated assets like keycorp also this statute requires the federal reserve to continue to conduct periodic stress tests of bhcs with assets between billion and billion like keycorp and the requirement for a publicly traded bhc to have a risk committee continues to apply if a bhc has assets of at least billion on june the federal reserve issued a final rule establishing sccl requirements for bhcs with billion or more in total consolidated assets the final rule does not apply to keycorp the federal reserve has taken no further action on the early remediation requirements proposed in in one of the tailoring rules issued in october to implement egrrcpa the federal reserve amended certain of its rules governing epss to apply tailored regulatory standards to large bhcs in each of the four riskbased categories of institutions described in the tailoring rules based on keys analysis of the tailoring rules keycorp believes that it is a category iv firm the least restrictive of these categories the tailoring rules are discussed further under the headings regulatory capital requirements liquidity requirements and regulatory capital requirements capital planning and stress testing bank transactions with affiliates federal banking law and regulation imposes qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates including the banks parent bhc and certain companies the parent bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on armslength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the banks regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it these provisions significantly restrict the ability of keybank to fund its affiliates including keycorp kbcm and keycorps nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested provisions added by the doddfrank act expanded the scope of i the definition of affiliate to include any investment fund having any bank or bhcaffiliated company as an investment adviser ii credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of lowquality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral the quantitative limits and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative repurchase agreement and securities lendingborrowing transactions and iii transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliateissued debt obligations that are not securities in addition these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements at all times that it is outstanding rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction these provisions also raise significantly the procedural and substantive table of contents hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements while these provisions became effective on july the federal reserve has not yet issued a proposed rule to implement them supervision and governance on november the federal reserve announced that it is adopting a new supervisory rating system for large financial institutions including bhcs with total consolidated assets of billion or more like keycorp lfi rating system in order to align the federal reserves rating system with the postcrisis supervisory programs for these firms the lfi rating system will provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institution possesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range of conditions and will assess an institutions capital planning and positions liquidity risk management and positions and governance and controls institutions subject to the lfi rating system will be rated using the following scale broadly meets expectations conditionally meets expectations deficient1 and deficient2 with the conditionally meets expectations rating intended to be used as a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation the federal reserve assigned initial ratings under the lfi rating system in to institutions that are subject to the large institution supervision coordinating committee framework excluding keycorp and assigned initial ratings in for all other large financial institutions subject to this rating system including keycorp the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system was the subject of two separate but related proposals i proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financial institutions and ii proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions the proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors was published by the federal reserve on august the final guidance on this subject was issued by the federal reserve on february the final guidance describes the key attributes of effective boards of directors of large financial institutions including bhcs with billion or more in total consolidated assets this guidance adopts a principlesbased approach to describe attributes of effective boards of directors and provides illustrative examples of effective practices the federal reserve indicated that it intends to use the board effectiveness guidance in informing its assessment of governance and controls at all firms subject to the lfi rating system including keycorp the federal reserve has not finalized the proposed guidance referenced above regarding core principles for effective senior management business management and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions this guidance which was proposed by the federal reserve on january would support the supervisory evaluation under the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system together with the abovementioned guidance regarding the effectiveness of a firms board of directors in general the guidance proposes core principles for effective senior management business line management and the independent risk management and control function the guidance encourages firms to establish a governance structure with appropriate levels of independence and stature by appointing a chief risk officer and a chief audit officer finally the guidance emphasizes the importance of independent risk management internal controls and internal audit and establishes principles that firms should use to establish or augment those management and control frameworks comments on this proposal were due by march we are awaiting the final rulemaking community reinvestment act the community reinvestment act cra was enacted in to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities that they serve including low and moderateincome lmi neighborhoods consistent with the institutions safe and sound operations the cra requires the federal banking agencies to assess the record of each institution that they supervise in meeting the credit needs of its entire community including lmi neighborhoods on may the occ issued

was discontinuing the cra information collection published in december that relates to this subject on july the occ announced that it had completed its review of the final rule and that it planned to i propose rescinding the final rule and ii work with the federal reserve and the fdic to develop a joint rulemaking to strengthen and modernize regulations implementing the cra also on july the occ the federal reserve and the fdic issued an interagency statement indicating that they are committed to working together to issue a joint rulemaking with respect to cra modernization on december the occ issued a final rule to rescind the final rule and replace it with a rule based largely on the cra rules adopted jointly by the federal banking agencies in the occ indicated that the adoption of this final rule creates consistency for all insured depository institutions and facilitates the ongoing interagency work to modernize the cra regulatory framework this final rule was effective on january but the compliance date for the final rules public file and public notice provisions was april on may the federal banking agencies issued for public comment a proposal to strengthen and modernize their regulations implementing the cra to better achieve the purposes of the law adapt to changes in the banking industry and provide clarity and consistency in the application of their regulations among other things the proposal would revise the community development definitions to clarify eligibility criteria for a broad range of community development activities would adopt four new tests under which large banks with more than billion in assets including keybank would be evaluated would apply a new framework for assigning conclusions and ratings to banks would require the evaluation of a large banks performance in retail lending assessment areas in addition to facilitybased assessment areas and would impose new data collection and reporting requirements on large banks the four new tests under which large banks would be evaluated are a retail lending test a retail services and products test a community development financing test and a community development services test various metrics and performance standards would be applied under these tests comments on this proposal were due by august keybank will be required to comply with any final rule that might be adopted control standards on january the federal reserve adopted a final rule setting forth a new comprehensive framework for determining control under the bhca and the home owners loan act the final rule simplifies and provides greater transparency regarding the standards used by the federal reserve to determine whether one company has control over another company the final rule codifies existing

total equity investment in another company along with a variety of other factors including board representation officer and employee interlocks and the existence of business relationships between the companies by providing greater clarity regarding the standards that will be applied for control determinations the final rule may facilitate i bhcs making minority investments in nonbank companies and
