of our stakeholders with that id like to now turn it over to don to walk through the quarter don donald r kimble chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thanks chris im now on slide as chris said it was a strong start to the year with net income from continuing operations of per common share up from the prior quarter and over times from the yearago period the quarter reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses the reserve release was largely driven by expected improvement in the economic environment importantly we generated record first quarter revenue driven by the strength in our feebased businesses ill cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation turning to slide total average loans were billion up from the first quarter of last year driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans commercial loans reflected keys participation in ppp partially offset by decreased utilization ppp loans had an impact of billion on the first quarter of average balances consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from laurel road and as chris mentioned record performance from our consumer mortgage business with billion of consumer mortgage loans this quarter the investments we have made in these areas continue to drive results and importantly add highquality loans and relationships linkedquarter average loan balances were down reflecting lower commercial utilization rates and a reduction in average ppp balances we had just under billion of ppp forgiveness in the current quarter consumer loans were up from the prior quarter again related to continued production from consumer mortgage and laurel road continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the first quarter of up billion or compared to the yearago period and up from the prior quarter the linkedquarter and yearago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances which benefited from government stimulus the growth was offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits the interestbearing deposit costs came down another basis points from the fourth quarter of following an 8basispoint decline last quarter we continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over of our total deposit mix keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 turning to slide taxableequivalent net interest income was billion for the first quarter of compared to million a year ago and billion for the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the first quarter of compared to for the same period last year and from the prior quarter both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the yearago period the larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows compared to the prior quarter net interest income decreased million and the margin declined basis points the decrease in net interest income was caused by the day count of approximately million lower loan fees of million and lower loan balances resulting in an additional million reduction to nii net interest margin also reflected a 4basispoint reduction due to the increases in our liquidity position moving on to slide we have continued to see growth in our feebased businesses noninterest income was million for the first quarter of compared to million for the yearago period and million in the fourth quarter compared to the yearago period noninterest income increased we had a record first quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees which reached million driven by broadbased strength across the platform this quarter both debt and equity markets were especially strong record mortgage originations drove mortgage consumer mortgage fees this quarter which were up million or from the first quarter of cards and payments income also increased million related to higher prepaid card activity from state government support programs as well as the growth in the core platform other income in the yearago period included million of marketrelated valuation adjustments compared to the fourth quarter noninterest income decreased by million largest driver of the quarterly decrease was seasonality in our investment banking line coming off an alltime high record quarter this was partially offset by the strength in trust and investment services income and cards and payments income im now on slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion compared to million last year and billion in the prior quarter the increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel expense related to higher productionrelated incentive compensation which increased million and the increase in our stock price resulting in a million increase compared to last year employee benefit cost also increased million yearoveryear paymentsrelated costs reported in other expense were million higher driven by higher prepaid activity computer processing expense this quarter was elevated related to software investments across the platform accounting changes and timing differences compared to the prior quarter noninterest expense decreased million the decline was largely due to lower productionrelated incentives and severance costs moving now to slide overall credit quality continues to outperform expectations for the first quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of million this was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy and loan production nonperforming loans were million this quarter or basis points of periodend loans a decline of almost million from the prior quarter additionally criticized loans declined and the to 90day delinquencies also improved again quarteroverquarter with a 5basispoint decrease while the 90dayplus category remained relatively flat keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 now onto slide keys capital position remains an area of strength we ended the first quarter with a common equity tier ratio of which places us above our targeted range of to this provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders importantly we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities our board of directors approved a first quarter dividend of per common share we also repurchased million of common shares under the share repurchase authorization we announced in january of up to million this leaves us with a capacity of up to million for the next two quarters on slide we provide our fullyear outlook which weve adjusted to reflect our strong start to the year positive momentum in our business and more favorable revenue outlook consistent with our prior guidance we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the year average loans are expected to be relatively stable reflecting continued momentum in our consumer areas the impact of ppp and stronger commercial growth in the second half of the year the first quarter should be the low point of the year with expected growth from here we expect deposits to be up midsingle digits and that we will continue to benefit from our lowcost deposit base net interest income should be up lowsingle digits our net interest income will benefit from higher loan fees related to ppp forgiveness and continued deployment of some of the excess liquidity offset by the ongoing impact of low rates noninterest income should be up midsingle digits reflecting the growth in most of our core feebased businesses noninterest expense should be relatively stable reflecting higher productionbased incentives related to our improved revenue outlook our continuous improvement efforts and branch consolidation plans remain on track and will help support our ongoing investments in talent and to stay at the forefront of our digital offerings moving on to credit quality we have reduced our net chargeoff guidance which is now expected to be in the to 45basispoint range for the year this reflects the quality of our portfolio and our current outlook and our guidance for our gaap tax rate remains unchanged at around for the year finally shown at the bottom of the slide are our longterm targets which remain unchanged we expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency which will drive returns overall it was a good start to the year and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders with that i will now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions on the qa portion of our call operator keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question will come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler and your line is open please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hello donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp hey scott howre you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey sorry i think i was on mute or something there good to talk to you guys this morning appreciate you taking the questions first question was just on given that you guys sort of have a broader product mix than other traditional regional banks given your capital markets exposure just im curious if you guys are seeing any preference from your corporate clients in terms of traditional banking products versus opting for capital market products that you might have expected to be just sort of more traditional banking has there been any preference shift there christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp scott its chris we have seen a preference to kind of take our clients to where the most advantageous financing is and one of the areas i would point you to would be our real estate book and youll notice if you look at the h8 data we underperformed some of our competitors in terms of what were putting on our balance sheet but yet were only putting about or of the capital we raise so if you think about really attractive nonrecourse 10year money fannie freddie fha the life companies the cmbs market that would be an example of where these middlemarket companies are consistently opting to go to other sources of funding other than the banks and obviously for us that ties really well with our business model so that would be an example r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then i guess actually just sort of a tickytack one for don i saw the billion of average balances of ppp loans do you happen to have the end of period just for modeling purpose im guessing somewhere in the billion range given what you said about forgiveness in the first quarter but was curious if you had a more pinpointing number keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp sure the ending balance was billion we actually originated billion of new loans under the current program and we also have a pipeline of approved through the sba of an additional million will be expected to close in the second quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right glad i asked there so that is helpful clarification i appreciate you guys taking the questions donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you scott operator thank you next question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley and your line is open christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey in terms of the laurel road for doctors can you just help us understand is that a i guess a marketing decision of how youre positioning laurel road or does it actually require you guys to build out capabilities to talent people to be able to offer services specific to doctors where its not just a marketing sort of gimmick thanks christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp no it certainly is a lot broader than just marketing and kind of a couple of proof points just since we launched laurel road for doctors on march our website traffic ken is up weve had discrete sessions with doctors and dentists on the website we also have garnered new doctordentist households and obviously well start building this out in concentric circles so what this is it is a complete digital offering focused on doctors and dentists and so its much broader than a single product it is to meet the needs of doctors and dentists which are both unique and to some degree homogeneous so it isnt just marketing for sure its very focused ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it understood okay and then just a different followup question how do you guys see seasonality playing out in the investment banking and debt placement fees because if im not mistaken i believe first quarter tends to be a seasonally weak quarter but it was obviously a very strong business quarter keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure well as i mentioned it was a record first quarter for us in our investment banking business seasonality typically is backend loaded as people theres always a big push to get transactions done by yearend we obviously have been pleased by the trajectory of the business and we also are pleased that as things come out of the pipeline the pipeline is being replenished and the pipelines are strong so we feel good about it and we think well have another record year in our investment banking business one of the interesting things is theres a lot of ma activity so while theres not a lot of borrowing in our strategic discussions with the people that are running these midmarket and midsized companies they are looking to do strategic things which really opens the door for us to provide a lot of services ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you operator thank you our next question will come from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research and your line is open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning chris and don christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc i wanted to ask about your loan pipeline were hearing varying degrees of optimism around growth in the second half of postreopening can you give a little bit of color on the tailwind that youre anticipating based on the discussions youre having with clients and the extent to which the liquidity on their balance sheets is impacting their appetite to borrow christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure thats a great question let me kind of break it into consumer and commercial on the consumer side we had a record year in terms of a record quarter i beg your pardon in terms of number of new households we also had a record quarter in terms of mortgage originations at billion so we have a lot of trajectory on the consumer side the consumer is spending and while you dont see it in credit card balances because at origination our average consumer has a fico score of around what you do see it in is the velocity in both debit and credit we believe that our growth engines in consumer last year we generated about billion of originations between laurel road and mortgage we think we will do more than that this year and that trajectory is theyre up and running keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 lets talk about commercial a little bit which is clearly delayed first of all commercial right now we have really unprecedented utilization as in low utilization so i think one of the areas where we can grow from a commercial perspective is as there are supply chain challenges as there is clearly some inflation out there i think youll see people start to build their inventory and i would suspect well see utilization improve from the low point that it is now as i mentioned theres a lot of strategic discussions going on that should generate loan growth what were not seeing right now is investment in people and property plant and equipment and i would guess that on the people front one of the challenges for our customers is its hard to hire people so thats one of the challenges but on property plant and equipment i would expect that to ramp up in the second half these projects as you know take a fair amount of lead time so consumer strong throughout the year i think commercial is going to be relatively flat in the first half and will pick up in the second half bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thanks chris don as a followup sorry if i missed this but whats driving the improved nii outlook you still expect relatively stable loan growth so is the improvement coming from ppp and on ppp can you tell us what the anticipated total revenue benefit is after factoring in forgiveness will most of that come in just trying to get a sense if you could clarify for us within the outlook what kind of nii growth you guys expect exppp donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp sure if you look at the fullyear outlook that we had provided in january compared to what we have today and just using the midpoint net interest income is up about million and roughly million to million of that is coming from the improved rate outlook that weve seen with the rate curve moving up and just the impact of that in the overall portfolio if you take a look at the loan balances overall that i would say that theyre up very modestly but it really shows a little bit more of a mix improvement there as far as the yield impact as chris highlighted that we had record mortgage originations of billion this past quarter weve increased our outlook as far as the overall mortgage balances going onto the balance sheet and pullback a little bit on the commercial given the lower utilization rates we saw in the first quarter and so that mix shift also helped a little bit as far as ppp we talked on the call in january about we thought that with the new loans that wed be seeing coming through with the current wave of ppp if you take a look at the net interest income which includes both the interest plus the fee income we thought thatd be up about million yearoveryear and thats about the same as what were seeing this year as far as our outlook in april and so were still seeing that kind of an incremental benefit and then as far as the forgiveness we would expect last years production of the billion about of that to be forgiven throughout the remainder of this year and so we will see that acceleration occur as far as some of the fee income in future quarters compared to what we experienced in the first quarter but generally fairly consistent with what we would have expected back in january bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful chris and don thank you very much for taking my questions donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi and your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp hey john christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on the margin side i just want to see don if you can kind of walk us through your expectations of how the how you expect the margin to traject here over the remainder of the year and lets assume that your nii up low singledigit outlook i guess if you can give it perhaps with the ppp impact and without that would help thanks donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp sure as far as the margin outlook we would expect it to be stable to slightly up from here so maybe up a couple of basis points throughout the rest of the year really reflecting some of the improvement in the loan fees and as we mentioned earlier from the fourth quarter to the first quarter one of the drivers of why our nii was down was about million lower loan fees and some of that was related to the ppp because we had higher levels of forgiveness in the fourth quarter than what we actually did in the first quarter of this year and so as far as the ppp impact we would expect that the total nii level contributed for first quarter versus the rest of the year to continue to trend down a little bit very modestly at first and thinking of million or million a quarter coming from that just with the impact of the forgiveness of those loans but generally again fairly consistent with what we would have expected coming into the year as far as the trajectory and our outlook for those balances john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thank you thats very helpful and then separately on the healthcare banking effort one question ive been getting about this is the expected longerterm impact that you may forecast from this whole effort not just the digital effort with laurel road for doctors but i guess also when you look at the combined effort that you flagged before by involving your cain brothers business as well as the emerging relationship in your backyard there with the cleveland clinic keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 when you look at this long term how do you size up the expected overall impact and maybe as a percentage of revenue or earnings or returns or even percentage of loans on the loan side or deposits just want to help people think about how big this thing can be thanks christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp so john its chris we have not yet framed that for investors obviously this is we just launched the national digital affinity bank just at the end of march obviously healthcare is rapidly approaching of the gdp so there is a huge opportunity and as you look throughout key we do a lot of business in healthcare throughout our franchise for example while not part of laurel road doctors and dentists are a significant driver of our mortgage business for example and if you think about serving these large hospitals and what we can do for the ceo in terms of provide him strategic advice raise capital at the dealing with the cfo a lot we can do around payments and then with the chief human resources officer the ability to refinance student loans the ability for docs to manage their money we have billion of aum so it is a huge opportunity we havent yet laid it out for the public yet what our targets are as it relates specifically to laurel road last year we generated billion in loan refinancing this year in spite of frankly some of the noise around student lending in general we will continue to grow that business so thats just a data point for you john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it thats helpful thanks chris operator thank you our next question will come from the line of erika najarian with bank of america and your line is open erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp good morning erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc my first question is for you chris i just wanted to tap into your experience key is uniquely positioned to benefit from capex coming back online and as we think about the excess liquidity in the system are deposits going to be a leading indicator for line utilization or are your clients telling you that theyre going to keep excess levels of cash for the time being and then additionally this curve steepening from the longend rising how does that play into historically the decision between capital markets and revolvers keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so first as it relates to deposits i think its probably somewhere in between your two scenarios i think based on what weve all been through over the last to months i think youll see people carry a little higher levels of cash but clearly i think they will definitely burn down some of those excessive deposits before they start borrowing and i think as you think about going forward the use of revolvers or going to various markets i think to the extent that people have a defined use of proceeds i think youll see people try to lock in longerterm money because at current rates i just think that makes a lot of sense for some of these longterm projects erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just as a followup on the question whether or not a steeper curve from a higher longend that could effect impact the decision between capital markets and revolvers in terms of funding preference christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp i dont think the steepness of the curve will matters a lot to us i think what our clients really think about from a strategic perspective is this a longterm asset and if i go out if i term it out as opposed to using my revolver is that an advantageous financing for the long term i dont think theyre driven by the steepness of the curve erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just for don the outlook for noninterest expense being relatively stable does that contemplate another record year in investment banking and debt placement fees donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp that does contemplate that as chris highlighted that we expect that to show growth on a yearoveryear basis and also show the stronger residential mortgage production as well and so both of those are part of the reasons why the fee income is up and also the expenses are up on a corresponding basis erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator thank you next well go to the line of chris usdin sic ken usdin with jefferies and your line is open keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning thanks i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the reinvestments that you said you made this quarter billion ending balance increase could you just help us understand just where that frontbook backbook math is at this point on both securities and also if you just have any comments on loan pricing and spreads too thanks donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp sure ken as far as our securities portfolio that we did add to both the core book as well as a shortterm treasury book weve got as of the end of the period about a billion over the last two quarters increase in the core bond portfolio that was really done in some of the core type of products and investments we would normally invest in which would include cmos and 15year passthroughs we also did some commercial mortgage agency securities as well and attached swaps to those so that basically it locks in that fixed rate for the first say four to six years and then converts it to a nice loading rate for us and so the average yield on those purchases was around million the rolloff of our existing portfolio is around a million to million range and so we do see continued pressure there based on where the current rates are but is just consistent with what were seeing in the markets overall as far as that shortterm treasury portion of the portfolio we added again about billion also over the last two quarters the average yield on that is about basis points and while its fairly low its a fairly short duration of the portfolio and really is just representing a safe substitute for the cash position as were continuing to maintain cash levels of about billion which is up from our target level of about billion and no more than billion and so just something well continue to evaluate as far as the overall outlook as far as putting some of those additional dollars to work and hopefully we start to see some of that additional commercial growth and utilization rates pick up which would be a much better option for us as far as using some of that excess liquidity on the loan side that we are seeing some tightening from the competitive perspective on the commercial side that as you might imagine theres stronger demand thats coming from banks to provide those loans and so we are seeing a little bit tightening there compared to where we were a year ago and on the consumer side spreads on a curveadjusted basis continue to be pretty good for us both laurel road and residential mortgage are wider spreads than where they would typically be even though the yields are still low compared to where we might want to see that overall portfolio but generally holding up pretty well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then don just one more followup on ppp do you have the first quarter contribution from just the nii contribution of ppp in total donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp well the net interest income or the interest income so this wouldnt include any funding cost associated with it it was million and that was down from million last quarter and we would expect just some very slight reductions in that million level over the next few quarters and essentially with the forgiveness triggering some acceleration of the fee income offsetting some of the reduction in future balances as that forgiveness goes through keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah understood thank you don donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo and your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc chris i know you built the investment banking business and you expect another record year but thats it seems a little bold this early in the year so what gives you confidence of i guess what are your backlogs are they record and how far above are they versus the prior record backlog if thats the case and maybe just a little bit about how you see the size of the pie and your wallet share and what percentage of your middlemarket customers have investment banking or just a little bit more color that gives you confidence christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so as we look at the pipelines as i mentioned mike our pipelines are strong and theyre strong in the areas that have long lead times but theyre also strong in the areas that have a fair amount of velocity think about the debt markets for example so the pipelines are there also as we look at the mix and ive mentioned this before the level of ma activity tends to have a multiplier effect and so as were advising on a lot of significant transactions it gives us the opportunity to do what we do for our clients provide capital after providing advice also provide enterprise payments help them hedge so those are the things that give me confidence that were going to be able to grow the business again this year we also have a lot of repeat customers were really proud of the fact that a lot of our customers go to the markets relatively regularly and we do a good job for them and so they hire us in a repetitive fashion those are some of the reasons that i feel confident about the business we also continue to hire quality people to bring on to our platform we have what we think is a unique platform candidly i still think its underleveraged and theres an opportunity for us in a very targeted way go out and hire people that we think can advance the business keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then a followup your ceo letter says that you guys are the number one provider of renewable energy financing so what does that include is that bank lending and capital markets christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah so that would be mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and whats the total addressable market and where are you in that market christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure sure so thats we have been a leader in we always talk about targeted scale and renewables is a great example that way back in as we saw the utilities pivot to renewable energy we built a business around both wind and solar on our books today mike we have about billion of exposure obviously over the years weve raised tens of billions of dollars for the benefit of our clients i think our pipelines in that business probably have visibility on billion or so whats really interesting is i think as the whole plan comes together for the american jobs plan i think therell be a big focus on renewable energy and we feel like were really well positioned and so well continue to lean in well continue to invest we have good relationships with the whole ecosystem and so that would be an example of targeted scale it wasnt that big of a business when we started it but it will continue to grow mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you operator thank you next we will go to the line of gerard cassidy with rbc and your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi chris hi don christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys share with us we all know what has happened with quantitative easing and the increase in the industrys deposit as evidenced by the over trillion growth we saw last year in the banking industries deposits you guys have certainly seen it on your balance sheet and it shows up and you mentioned the stimulus programs have contributed to your deposit growth can you share with us how do you see your customers using these deposits and is there any evidence yet from the earlier stimulus plans that we saw in the spring of last year the initial checks that individuals received as well as the initial ppp programs that theyre actually drawing down the deposits or do you think that your deposits could remain elevated for an extended period of time because of the continuation of qe and the government deficit spending we expect over the next to months christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp i think the consumers are spending part of it so youre right the industry has about trillion of excess deposits we at key have about billion and if you looked on our consumer balances our consumer balances are up yearoveryear gerard about importantly on the deposits that are nonrate sensitive theyre up but we i think you will see those particularly if theres not additional stimulus weve had three waves now i think youll start to see those burned down were certainly seeing it in card spend for example don what would you add to that donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp no i think youre right i mean in the first quarter i think we saw card spend up about across our customer base and maybe thats a leading indicator there but gerard those deposit balances have been amazingly sticky and i think it reflects the impact of the ongoing stimulus programs that come through and the checks that have been cut to the consumer and so those have been very resilient as far as the overall balances i think we will see balances remain strong for a period of time even as the economy starts to pickup but would expect probably as we are also expecting to see commercial lending picking up in the second half of the year i would expect some of those commercial deposits to start coming under a little bit of pressure to as chris highlighted maybe do a little bit of both where you pull back a little bit on that liquidity on the balance sheet but also start to borrow against some of the lines to help fund some of the needed investments in inventory and just other growth gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 very good and then chris in terms of using excess capital for acquisitions key over the years has been successful in acquiring not necessarily depositories but the complementary businesses particularly in the investment banking and then laurel road of course can you share with us your thoughts and not so much im not too interested in if youre looking at a depository but more just the addon businesses are there opportunities or needs for you that you can buy another a brokerdealer or advisor or something like that to enhance the investment banking business as you go forward christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp i think theres always a niche businesses and what we found gerard is when we bring on these niche businesses im really proud of the way weve been able to integrate them because most of these businesses by definition are entrepreneurial businesses the most recent one obviously was just last quarter when we purchased aqn which is an analytics business but there are clearly opportunities with our targeted scale for us to go out and acquire these entrepreneurial companies that by the way are good companies that were able to integrate but they really bring a skill set to key as well with laurel road i think we acquired full stack software engineers for example and that clearly will be helpful as we advance our digital strategy throughout key so yes there are opportunities and well keep our eyes open for those gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you operator thank you next well go to the line of terry mcevoy with stephens and your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi actually just one question for you don the cards and payments income up and over million in the first quarter i was hoping if you could just talk about how the stimulus plan kind of impacted prepaid card activity and maybe a better way to think about the run rate in a more normal operating environment keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp yeah sure if you look at the increase yearoveryear there was about million i would say millionish of that is really related to the prepaid card business that weve talked about before thats used to support various state government programs in this environment that at the same time we saw that increase we also saw a corresponding increase in our expenses of million and so nearterm the benefit really is from those deposits that are being maintained there and so we would expect those programs to continue to wind down throughout the year and so we will see that cards and paymentsrelated revenue line item coming down for that but also see a corresponding impact on the expense side as well as we mentioned earlier we were starting to see in the first quarter some nice trends as far as the yearoveryear growth rates in all of our card programs whether it was consumer credit card or debit card or whether it was the commercial card products that we have and so were excited about that core momentum and probably would expect to see growth there on a core basis but might be a little cloudy to see that as we would expect to see some of that prepaid balance our activity throughout the year terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great and then just as a quick followup the revised outlook for expenses up since january is any of that connected to the announcement last month and the buildout of laurel road for doctors donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp well i would say that we will have increased costs associated with that but the run rate and the buildout was reflected in our january outlook and so none of that really came through there that as you think about what the change in our outlook was and just using the midpoint of those guidance ranges but total revenues are up million from what we would have shown before expenses are up million and so efficiency ratio of about on that revenue growth and that really relates to the growth coming from higher expected capital marketsrelated revenues and higher consumer mortgage revenues which both have a strong variable expense component to it terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc appreciate that thanks don donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve alexopoulos with jpmorgan and your line is open janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning this is janet lee on for steve alexopoulos keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning janet janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning just digging deeper into your nii guidance of up lowsingledigit and your nim outlook for stable is slightly up for can you provide more details around what youre assuming in terms of the level and deployment of excess liquidity on your balance sheet so how much of billion of shortterm investments in the first quarter is assumed to go into securities as we look out donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp yes we would expect very incremental changes as far as deploying some of those that initially the liquidity will be absorbed through additional loan balances and so as we mentioned before we expect the first quarter to be the low point for us for average loan balances for the year and thats really led by the consumer growth initially and then we would expect to see line utilization rates pick up in the second half of the year for commercial and so that will be helpful and then as far as the investment portfolio that over the last couple of quarters we put to work a net say billion to billion of additional investments outside of the treasury portfolio and so i would think that that would be an expected pace of maybe deploying billion to billion per quarter as far as shifting out of cash and putting that into the investment portfolio in addition to the loan growth janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thats helpful and shifting to fee income can you talk through why service charges on deposits declined sequentially in the first quarter back to sort of the prepandemic levels is this more of a function of customers having elevated deposit balances and not incurring overdraft fees or is there something else going on donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp you nailed it thats essentially whats happened here is on the service charge on deposits the primary reason for the decline is related to just that very fact that the consumers have stronger balances and so they have lower nsf od fees and also the commercial customers have stronger balances which results in fewer service charges for those accounts as well and so that excess liquidity is providing a relief for the customers as far as fee income janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thanks for taking my questions donald r kimble a chief financial officer and chief administrative officer keycorp thank you keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2021 operator thank you and with that we have no further questions ill turn it back over to the speakers for any closing comments christopher m
