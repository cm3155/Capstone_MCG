management discussion section operator ladies and gentlemen good morning and welcome to keycorps first quarter earnings conference call as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to the chairman and ceo chris gorman please go ahead christopher m gorman chairman president chief executive officer keycorp well good morning and thank you for joining us for keycorps first quarter earnings conference call joining me on the call today are clark khayat our chief financial officer don kimble our vice chairman and chief administrative officer and mark midkiff our chief risk officer on slide you will find our statement on forwardlooking disclosure and nongaap financial measures it covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the questionandanswer segment of our call i am now moving to slide before i comment on our quarterly results i want to touch on three areas that i know have been top of mind for investors namely deposits capital and credit quality key has significantly strengthened each of these areas over the last decade we have derisked our business and built a differentiated franchise that is well positioned for all business conditions including the current environment keys relationshipbased business model provides us with strong keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 granular deposit base and with attractive lending and feebased opportunities our longterm standing strategic commitment to primacy that is serving as our clients primary bank continues to serve us well over of our deposit balances are from consumers wealth clients small businesses and escrow accounts over of our commercial balances are core operating accounts the diversity of our deposits extends across client type account size industry and geography our deposits come from million retail small business private banking and commercial customers with covered by fdic insurance and an additional of balances that are collateralized in the first quarter our periodend deposits remained stable and balances from march to present remain relatively unchanged with respect to capital keys position remains strong with a common equity tier ratio of this positions us well to execute against our capital priorities including supporting our clients we are also aware of the heightened focus on accumulated other comprehensive income aoci aoci improved this quarter by which drove a basis point improvement in our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio our capital position will benefit from the expected billion improvement in aoci by credit quality remains strong once again reflecting our proactive and intentional derisking over the past decade in our consumer bank we serve a wide range of clients our weighted average fico score at origination is above in our commercial bank of our credit exposure is to relationship clients and of our ci portfolio is investment grade we have built a strong originatetodistribute model that strengthens our risk management and allows us to offer our clients a wide range of on and off balance sheet financing options in the first quarter we raised billion for our clients another area of getting attention is commercial real estate our largest exposure is multifamily including a growing affordable housing segment there exists a significant shortage of available housing broadly and affordable housing specifically in the united states today as such affordable housing will continue to receive bipartisan government support importantly we have limited exposure to high risk areas such as office lodging and retail we also have unique insights into commercial real estate through our thirdparty commercial loan servicing business not only is this a great business with over billion of servicing assets but the business provides us with unique insight into the markets which vary greatly by asset type and geography each of these three areas that i have covered deposits capital and credit quality provide a foundation and support the longterm earnings power of our company with that as a backdrop let me move to slide and touch on a few quarterly highlights before i turn it over to clark to cover the quarter in detail this morning we reported earnings of million or per common share our results included million or per share as a result of both our increase in allowance for credit losses and the expense actions we previously announced the build in our allowance for credit losses is principally modeldriven and reflective of a greater range of outcomes as we look ahead our strong credit quality and guidance for net chargeoffs however remain unchanged our expense actions this quarter were part of a companywide effort to improve efficiency and support reinvestment back into our business we completed actions this quarter which represented over of our expense base or million in annualized benefit keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 this will allow us to hold noninterest expense relatively flat in spite of persistent inflation our results this quarter were driven by yearoveryear growth in both our consumer and commercial businesses in our consumer business we grew new households at a pace supporting our investor day target our commercial businesses also continued to add and expand relationships recent market disruption has provided us with further opportunity to acquire clients and opportunistically add high quality bankers to the platform net interest income declined from the fourth quarter reflecting higher interestbearing deposit costs and a shift in funding mix net interest income was also negatively impacted by our received fixed rate swaps which are used to hedge our floating rate portfolio swaps and treasuries reduced net interest income by million this quarter and lowered our net interest margin by basis points given the short duration of our swaps and treasuries and the meaningful repricing opportunity we will see significant benefit to our net interest income beginning late this year and extending into and beyond we have continued to take actions to lock in the net interest income benefit going forward clark will cover our interest rate positioning in detail during his presentation our feebased businesses in the first quarter showed several areas of strength but overall reflected expected weakness in capital markets although the market remains challenging we did experience a record first quarter in our ma advisory business while we do not anticipate a significant pickup in our capital markets business in the first half of the year we continue to expect deal activity to pick up sometime in the second half as i pointed out on the prior slide credit quality remained strong this quarter with net chargeoffs as a percentage of average loans of basis points our credit losses remain near historic lows and we remain confident in the way we have positioned our portfolio consistent with our moderate risk profile despite the market disruption we have not lost focus on driving our targeted scale strategy and investing in points of differentiation in our wealth business for example which currently has billion in assets under management we are bringing the power and capabilities of our private bank to better serve massaffluent clients through our retail channel our laurel road business is expanding to serve the distinct needs of healthcare professionals through hospital system partnerships in our commercial businesses we are empowering our relationship managers with a comprehensive suite of tools to enhance productivity and to better support our clients i remain confident in key and the longterm outlook for our business we have durable relationshipbased businesses that will continue to serve our clients our prospects and deliver value to our shareholders lastly i would like to thank our employees for what they do each and every day to serve our clients with that ill turn it over to clark to provide more details on the results of the quarter and our outlook clark clark h i khayat chief financial officer keycorp thanks chris and good morning im now on slide for the first quarter net income from continuing operations was per common share down from the prior quarter and down from last year driven in part by two notable items we incurred million of restructuring expense or per share which included keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 million of severance and other related costs and million of corporate real estate related rationalization and other contract terminations or renegotiations our results also included million of additional provision expense in excess of chargeoffs or per share as we continue to build our reserves reflecting a more cautious economic outlook and view on home prices turning to slide average loans for the quarter were billion up from the year ago period and up from the prior quarter as we continue to support relationship clients commercial loans increased from the year ago quarter relative to the same period consumer loans increased reflecting growth in consumer mortgage compared with the fourth quarter of commercial loans grew our commercial growth continues to reflect the strength in our targeted industry verticals and support for our relationship clients continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the first quarter of down from the year ago period and down billion or compared to the prior quarter yearoveryear we saw declines in retail deposits driven by elevated spend due to inflation normalization from pandemic levels and changing client behavior due to higher rates commercial balances which included billion of brokered deposits remained relatively flat the decrease in deposits from the prior quarter reflects a continuation of these same trends interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points from the prior quarter and our cumulative deposit beta was since the fed began raising interest rates in march our outlook for now assumes a cumulative deposit beta peaking in the low turning to slide we wanted to provide incremental detail on the granularity and composition of our billion deposit portfolio at the end of the first quarter approximately of our deposits came from consumer wealth and small business clients an incremental of deposits are from lowcost stable escrow balances the remaining approximately of our deposits comes from our large corporate and middle market commercial clients over of commercial segment deposit balances are from core operating accounts our total deposit of our total deposits are covered by fdic insurance while an additional are collateralized we maintain access to enough liquidity to cover over of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits the quality of our deposit base derives from the strength of our relationshipbased strategy which has benefited key both from a balanced stability and cost perspective at periodend our loan to deposit ratio was now moving to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was billion for the first quarter compared with billion in the yearago quarter and billion in the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the first quarter compared to for the same period last year and for the prior quarter yearoveryear net interest income and the net interest margin benefited from higher earning asset balances and higher interest rates partly offset by higher interestbearing deposit costs and a shift in funding mix relative to  our net interest margin was negatively impacted by basis points related to higher interestbearing deposit costs and basis points from a change in funding mix and liquidity and loan fees partly offset by basis points related to higher interest rates and earning asset growth as chris noted earlier our swap portfolio and shortdated treasuries reduced net interest margin by basis points in the quarter additionally the net interest income was lower reflecting two fewer days of the quarter keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 turning to slide as previously mentioned key ph tends to benefit significantly from the maturity of our shortdated swap book in treasuries this opportunity is consistent with the billion of upside weve been talking about over the last few quarters while we recently offered more detail on the swaps and treasuries by quarter and interest rate we thought it would be valuable to include a view on the realization of that potential value in both timing and amount the chart on slide shows this with the forward curve we do include the value should shortterm rates remain at current levels in a higher prolonger scenario as well weve also gotten questions about how we plan to lock in this value as weve shared weve taken a measured but opportunistic approach to adding hedges to address this potential the analysis on slide reflects the additional hedging activity weve undertaken beginning in  and since the point here is to provide one more level of depth to clarify the timing and magnitude of this opportunity as this demonstrates we continue to see significant future value in nii as these swaps and treasuries mature moving to slide noninterest income was million in the first quarter of compared to million for the year ago period and million in the fourth quarter the decline in noninterest income from the year ago period reflects a million decline in service charges on deposit accounts due to changes in our nsfod fee structure that we previously discussed and implemented in september and lower account analysis fees related to interest rates additionally investment banking and debt placement fees declined million reflecting lower syndication fees partly offset by an increase in advisory fees while corporate services income declined million reflecting lower loan fees and marketrelated adjustments in the prior period the decline in noninterest income from the fourth quarter reflects a million decline in investment banking and debt placement driven by lower advisory and syndication fees recall that  is historically the low point for investment banking activity in the year other income decreased by million driven by visa litigation assessment and marketrelated adjustments additionally corporate services income decreased by million reflecting lower derivative volumes moving on to slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion up million from the year ago period and up million from last quarter inclusive of million of restructuring charges related to actions we completed this quarter to take out million in annualized costs as we shared on the  call we took these steps proactively to support investment in our business in the face of continued inflation compared with the year ago quarter and in addition to restructuring charges personnel expense increased reflecting an increase in salaries and head count partly offset by lower incentive compensation compared to the prior quarter and in addition to restructuring business services and professional fees declined million and marketing expense declined million additionally other expense increased in the first quarter by million reflecting an increase in the base fdic assessment rate keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 moving now to slide overall credit quality remains strong for the first quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans which remain near historically low levels our provision for credit losses was million for the first quarter which as we pointed out exceeded net chargeoffs by million to 89day delinquencies to periodend loans were down basis point to basis points while 90plus day delinquencies remain stable the excess provision increases our allowance for credit losses reflecting a more cautious modeldriven assumptions despite the increase in the allowance our outlook for net chargeoffs in of to basis points remains unchanged and well below our through the cycle levels of to basis points moving to slide with regard to commercial real estate in particular keys exposure is well controlled and credit quality remains strong over the past decade we meaningfully repositioned our commercial real estate book by sharply reducing our exposure to construction and homebuilders and reducing the level of commercial real estate loans in our book we focus on relationship lending with select owners and operators our improved risk profile has been demonstrated in keys most recent stress test results where projected losses in our commercial real estate book stands at compared to for peers now on slide our liquidity position is strong our periodend cash balances at the federal reserve stood at billion and we maintain flexibility with significant levels of unused borrowing capacity from additional sources we would expect to maintain higher cash balances until the market stabilizes our levels of additional available liquidity have not changed materially since the end of the quarter on to slide we ended the first quarter with common equity tier ratio of within our targeted range of to this provides us with sufficient capacity continue to support our relationship customers and their needs we completed million of open market share repurchases in the first quarter related to our employee compensation plan given market conditions we do not expect to engage in material share repurchases in the nearterm we will continue to focus our capital in supporting relationship client activity and paying dividends over the last six weeks theres been significant discussion of aoci and its potential inclusion in cet1 capital levels for category banks weve historically chosen to put most of our portfolio purchases and available for sale and given the recent market rise in rates we saw significant increases in the negative mark as time passes and if rates have come down weve seen our aoci mark decrease by and from billion at to billion at we shared on slide the expected reduction in the aoc mark from to the end of this year and the end of over that timeframe the aoc mark declined by approximately and while this analysis assumes the forward curve its important to note that of the value is for maturities and cash flows that is not rate dependent although we have no unique insight into the path of potential regulatory changes as weve seen historically when bank capital regulations have changed they carry with them comment periods in a reasonable phasein timeframe our view is that for any new requirements our reduction in aoci mark and more significantly our earnings would allow us to organically accrete capital to required levels over the necessary period keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 slide updates our full year outlook the guidance is relative to our full year results we expect average loans to grow between and importantly most of this growth has already occurred relative to so we dont expect material loan balance growth well continue to support relationship clients by recycling capital throughout the year we expect average deposits to be flat to down net interest income is now expected to decline by to driven by higher interestbearing deposit costs and a continued shift in funding mix our guidance is based on the forward curve assuming a fed funds rate peaking at in the third quarter and starting to decline in the fourth quarter these interest rate assumptions along with our expectations for customer behavior and the competitive pricing environment are very fluid and will continue to impact our outlook prospectively noninterest income guidance is unchanged we continue to expect it to be down to reflecting the implementation of our new nsfod fee structure last year and continued challenging capital markets activity at least in the first half our noninterest expense outlook is also unchanged we expect it to be relatively stable driven in part by the actions we took last quarter to accelerate cost savings which includes the impact of the million in restructuring charge for the year we continue to expect credit quality to remain strong and net chargeoffs to be in the to basis point range well below our over the cycle range of to basis points our guidance for our gaap tax rate is now to we feel confident in the foundation of our business the relationshipdriven value of our deposit book the durability of our balance franchise and our improved risk profile despite nearterm headwinds we continue to be focused on execution in and the strong longterm earnings power of our company with that ill now turn the call back to the operator for instructions on the qa portion of the call operator question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we go to the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning ebrahim how are you ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good so maybe just starting on deposits weve obviously gone from mid to high beta to now low i guess chris clark give us a sense of just in terms of your comfort level that this high if the forward curve or at least if the fed is done with one more hike why the low beta should be the right number in terms of your confidence level and just a rigor of the analysis that went behind that assumption keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure well get into that analysis in just a second but theres no question that we early were surprised at how low the betas were and as of late weve been surprised at the steepness of the curve so your question is a good one before i turn it over to clark let me just give you a little bit of context on our deposit base our total cost of deposits as is in the deck there is basis points our cost of interest bearing deposits are as we mentioned our cumulative beta is and as you just brought up we now expect betas to peak in the low but i just want to talk a little bit about the composition of our deposit base we are a business thats more heavily canted to commercial than retail and if you think about those deposits these are people that weve helped through many cycles most recently weve helped through ppp over of these accounts are operating accounts and so when people talk about whats insured whats not insured i think one thing that some people miss is if youre running a million or million or million business and we have the operating account those deposits arent going to go anywhere because its a living breathing thing so i just i thought i would just give you that context because when we think about deposits we always bifurcate it by category but getting back to your question clark give us the rigor behind the low and our confidence in same clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so id start i think with balances ebrahim i think we feel very good about where our balances sit today relative to where they have been relative to the market were in and relative to competitors so it starts with balances and then you get to pricing as weve talked about in the past weve been more focused on retention of deposits than acquisition of new deposits and i think that is reflected in the beta todate the other point since last sort of third quarter fourth quarter as weve watched the market develop i think we while we would not purport to have perfect information about behavior we have a much better view on how customers are interacting i think the commercial betas have mostly played through so weve seen those come up many of those as weve talked about ph before are indexed and others theres been a lot of conversation engagement with commercial clients the consumers are always slower to move and we believe at this point we have a better view on how theyre behaving the types of accounts they want and how competitors are reacting so when we look at the low number up a bit from the high we have some confidence that we can deploy beta in across the retail franchise but also in some targeted customer sets to not only retain but potentially acquire some deposits going forward ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for that and just maybe a quick one clark on the slide the bar chart with the nii upside from swaps and treasury rolloff give us a sense of sensitivity if rate is basis points lower next year versus today what does that mean for that upside that you lay out there keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so whats embedded in the chart on the page ebrahim is the forward curve which is coming off i dont have in front of me exactly what those rates are but theyre coming down pretty significantly over that timeframe i could follow up with a little more sensitivity but effectively you can think about the forward curve in that million range as we talked about annualized maybe the right comparison is if rates didnt move at all and the spot rate just sort of played out youd get back to that billion number so you see a little bit of a sensitivity between higher for longer version where the spot rate just sort of sticks versus the forward curve which is coming down fairly significantly over the next seven quarters ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and i think in the prepared remarks you said you were taking actions to lock that in how are you doing that clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp so i think weve shared before but im happy to talk about it so if you think about we had at the beginning of the year about billion of received fixed swaps rolling off billion in the first quarter at a rate of so that was sort of the highest of the twoyear rate the rest will roll off through the year so another billion were not replacing those so were going to allow on that portion the natural asset sensitivity of that loan book to come through next year another billion of swaps mature and weve essentially replaced those with a combination of forward starters at an average rate of so theres some negative carry in that but in the forward rate they actually are a bit in the money by the end of the year and then the other half with floor spreads that kick in at and the value of that as you can imagine is we get all of the floating rate value above until the forward curve comes down and if we were in a higher rate environment we would benefit from actually not hitting that floor so we think weve managed the downside risk there quite well and preserve some of the upside the reason we wouldnt do or havent done more or all floors or floor spreads at this point is just the cost of volatility is pretty high so were trying to balance the kind of the riskreward on that trade ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thanks for taking my questions clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure operator next we go to the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you for taking the questions clark as we look sort of from the margin at now and then that kind of i guess aspirational margin near ex treasuries and swaps i guess one of the big things has been sort of what happens between here and there do you have a sense for when based on what you see now when the margin would bottom where that might be and then kind of more specifically when it would start to inflect upward to i know the treasuries start to the treasuries and swaps thats more of an end of and into but will we get a margin inflection this year or is that something that do we continue to bleed out a bit through the remainder of the year before it inflects back up how do you think about that dynamic clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah good question scott so we would have originally thought  was the low point we think thats now  and then well start to see some stabilization and uptick in the back half of the year and again part of that is the really the swap book starts to roll off we begin to see some treasuries although theyre fairly light in and yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay thats perfect thank you and then chris maybe just a thought on the investment banking rebound in the second half i mean what does that kind of look like in your mind how powerful could it be its been such an odd environment you got the vix at a level where historically thered be a lot of activity now but it certainly feels very uncertain and i think weve all been sort of surprised by overall lack of activity so when you sort of look out over the remaining several months of the year whats sort of your best guess as to how a rebound might play out christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp i think you have to go through sort of the price discovery and i think theres a bid and ask basically on equities as you can see theres some deals getting priced you can see theres some high yield thats getting done but i think scott what its going to take is for kind of buyers and sellers to readjust their expectations and i think my experience is that process takes a while but eventually people adapt to kind of what the new normal is and as i said in my comments i actually think it will come back sometime in the second half our pipelines are down about from last year which in the grand scheme of things if you think about this time last year is not bad so the pipelines are good we actually had a nice quarter in terms of advisory but a lot of our clients frankly are sitting on the sidelines there are deals to be done and frankly were advising many of our clients that now is not the perfect time either to enter into the financing market or to complete a transaction but it will come back and the pipeline is building some deals will just go away but it will come back r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you all very much christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you scott keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 operator our next question is from john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning john clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi just a couple of questions regarding the nii outlook for the year can you just share with us your thought of the noninterestbearing deposit mix shift how you view that progressing and then also on the progression for the second quarter just regarding scotts question on the margin you mentioned that you see a pullback again in the second quarter and then inflection can you maybe help us size up that amount of margin compression incrementally in the second quarter thanks clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure from noninterestbearing weve seen that come down to we would think that that would make its way to the mid but i will say theres one caveat in there and that is we have been using i believe weve talked about this but weve been using what we refer to as a hybrid account with many of our commercial clients where were taking noninterestbearing deposits and some of their excess balances and keeping them together in one interestbearing account so weve moved balances out of noninterestbearing into those accounts they would reflect on the balance sheet as a decline in noninterestbearing but it allows us to maintain those balances in a technically interest bearing account but at very attractive rates so again we can break that out over time but i would say the non interestbearing decline probably isnt quite as stark as it would appear on its face as it relates to net interest income second quarter wed expect that to be down kind of to in  with nim nim coming down in part because were carrying a little bit excess liquidity post the early march period and we would see that come down we think maybe another basis points to basis points and then as i responded to and scotts question kind of stabilize and start to come back up in the second half of the year john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay all right thats helpful and you care to venture a projection in terms of the magnitude of the inflection in the back half of the nim keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp not at the moment we havent provided that yet but you would see our obviously our guide for the year on nim being down a little but thats obviously going to require us to be stronger in the second half than we expect to see that john pancari q analyst evercore isi got you okay thanks and then just separately on regulation wanted to see if you can maybe provide some comments around how youre thinking about the most likely areas of regulation where you expect some measures out of the regulators are around inclusion of aoci potentially tlac fdic stress capital buffer risk maybe if you could just comment on that chris im interested in your comments on that as well christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp id be happy to comment on that to the premise of your question theres no question that well be experiencing were going to have to carry more capital and therell be more regulation i personally think tlac is going to be part of that or some debt security that looks like tlac i also think that well probably have to carry more capital we as you can imagine have run all kinds of scenarios we feel comfortable that based on the burn down of our aoci based on the earnings power of the company and based on timing ie there would be some comment period and some phasein period we feel like no matter under all the scenarios that weve looked at we feel confident that key can be in a position to meet both the regulatory and the capital requirements going forward john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you john operator next we go to erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes hi good morning if i could ask the nii protection question another way clark the loan beta of your commercial portfolio was something like in the second half of and about this quarter as we think about the protection for down short rates and i think a lot of investors are expecting down short rates in should we interpret your protection as a lower sensitivity to each basis points of cuts that weve seen to the upside keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sorry can you ask that one more erika i just want to make sure im understanding the question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes so i wanted to understand slide in a different way right so clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc the protection on your commercial portfolio and locking in the upside so we saw the sensitivity to higher short rates in terms of the carry through to your yield at about the low in the second half of last year and in the mid this quarter right the way investors are interpreting protection to the downside is a lower sensitivity as the fed cuts right and so should we expect the key commercial yields have a lower sensitivity to cut on the way down than it did to increases in rates on the way up clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp i mean yes if you think about the incorporation of the swaps right so the swaps are there for exactly that purpose and they would reduce the sensitivity on the way down thats the intent of those instruments erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay and what youre showing us on slide is essentially the assumption that your current swap book as it rolls off gets replaced with a higher received fixed rate clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yes two components right in i think our view the forward curve i have not seen a view yet where rates come down below where swap rates would be so we would were going to let that roll through our natural loan rates and yields flow through in in weve effectively replaced the swap book with forward starters at a higher rate on average and floor spreads with a kickin rate of so if rates were to stay higher well get the value on the floor spreads well carry the negative carry on the forward starters if the forward curve plays out both of those will be in the money at some point in erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and im sorry to just put this all together in a third question but keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yes erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc as investors are thinking about whether bank stocks are truly cheap i think theyre thinking about eps as a trough so as i think about your commercial yield today right there are essentially sort of two headwinds right so the first would be the lower received fixed rate on your notional and the second would be on the other side of that right the yield will be better protected as the fed cuts so am i thinking about sort of the message on downside nii protection the right way as it relates to your commercial book clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah i think you said that well erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you operator and next we move to ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning just a followup on the swaps so maybe just to ask it a different way so in the back end number from the 10k of the reported impact from swaps in the fourth quarter was minus million do you have the number of what that negative impact was in the first quarter and can you help us understand what it will look like when we see the new disclosure for the roll forward next four quarters thanks clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp youre talking just swaps specifically ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yes million in the first quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thats million and then so last quarters next four quarters roll forward from the k was million after tax do you have an idea of what the new roll forward will be when we see that in the 10q keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp not at this point but we can follow up and let you know that ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then the last question is you mentioned the million and the billion and that youre not going to be replacing now could you maybe just flesh that out a little bit in terms of like the any change to that strategy around protection and how youll be replacing going forward to get that incremental forward benefit from the roll off versus what youre putting on clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so ill keep trying im worried im not being super clear so the billion of received fixed swaps in are going to mature billion of that matured in the first quarter were not planning to replace those to protect the loan book in year from a received fixed swap standpoint theres another billion that roll out through and weve taken steps to effectively replace that not all of it exactly its were in the billion range half of which is forward start received fix with an average rate of so just think about that as replacing the existing ph rate and now bringing that up to and then the other half with floor spreads that have an attachment point at also roughly just by coincidence so that really is the protection against rates coming down which the forward curve would project at this point and it would sort of lock that billion or so at a yield or higher as those other swaps roll off ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and i know that was asked so i apologize for reasking that clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp thats okay i think im maybe not doing it as clearly as possible so i appreciate the followup operator and next we go to a question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning mike keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc this is a tough quarter for you guys i guess relative to expectations you guys missed on nii nim fees provisions and expenses you guided nii lower down to this year when before it was up to you said nim will go down next quarter and so thats just given all those headwinds and pressures and maybe im misstating that and correct me if i did are you ratcheting down expenses more are you becoming more cautious or are you just kind of have to take the stomach punch of the higher funding and go on with it and part of that you didnt change your loan guidance but it doesnt look like youre being more cautious there so just i guess im trying to say is is this as bad as it looks or are there some silver lining out of this or i mean with your resiliency maybe you gain share but thats not showing up in your guidance christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah so thank you for the question let me just kind of broadly talk about the quarter mike theres no question it was a challenging quarter for us but we continue to do the things that we need to do to build the franchise and so what are those things you mentioned expenses we put a hiring freeze in place in november and we took out million or of our expense base just in the quarter we just completed so thats one of the things we do weve done weve talked a lot today about kind of how were managing our balance sheet we have taken significant actions and we have the luxury of taking the actions because theyre short duration both on our swaps and on our investments to put us in a position where we can benefit from the rise in interest rates so weve done that and then the other thing we continue to do as you know is we continue to strategically invest in our business and focus on targeted scale so my perspective is yes this is a challenging quarter yes we have to get through this nii drag but we have a clear path to do so and thats what we as a team are in the business of focusing on clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp and mike id just add two things on the expenses theyre up because of the charge million if you took that out wed be in good shape and i think if you annualize that number were right in line with our guidance relatively stable yearoveryear and again thats in the face of some inflationary headwinds i think on the provision you heard ph in our chargeoffs we didnt change our guidance which may beg the question of why did you build your provision and frankly were doing what we think cecl was intended to do which was when macroeconomic conditions change you build the reserve so were applying that standard and that would be the reconciliation between two quarters of build and no change in the chargeoff guidance mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc given that extra caution you kept your loan growth the same at to so im trying to reconcile your more caution with your provisions with no change in your loan guidance whereas others have brought down their loan guidance as they tighten things up keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah mike we have basically we are at the low end of our guidance for the year already so what were going to be doing for the balance of the year is were going to be recycling capital and to your point theres no question that the cost of raw material has gone up significantly were certainly not going to change our lending standards but in terms of pricing we will make those adjustments were fortunate that we have a bunch of relationships that pay us really well and were in a position to serve those relationships but as you and i have talked before lending on a standalone business thats hard to return your cost of capital so you can imagine when your cost of capital goes up that the pricing and the other things that youre doing for those customers frankly will have to be even greater clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so just to mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sorry mike just to be super clear the to yearoveryear loan growth really was resident at the end of so it really just reflects the growth that occurred in just to make that abundantly clear mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and so one more followup it seems like the capital markets is pricing for risk more than the lending markets but when you have that conversation with your commercial customers and say hey were going to pass on this higher cost of raw materials are you seeing any additional pricing power in lending markets i mean it just seems like loan yields should be going up more than they already have done christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah and they never go up as much as they should because frankly theres too much excess capacity in the banking market but no they havent moved and thats where it really pays to have a wholesome relationship like where we can drive a bunch of other revenue but there hasnt been the adjustment yet that there should be based on the arbitrage between the capital markets and the bank market mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess im going to sneak one last in there if thats the case then i mean if the cost of raw materials are going up and you cant get the loan yields you desire maybe just delever a little bit and just not have much growth but have less risk or i mean how do you view that tradeoff because just keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp no i think over time thats what youre going to see right well be using the capital markets as they open up to actually place paper for people but in terms of putting new debt on our balance sheet were not going to do it unless we have a complete relationship and we can drive a whole bunch of revenue and that in itself will be limiting mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it all right thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thanks mike operator and our next question is from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i wanted to follow up on the costcutting efforts that are underway to counter inflation just given the events of the past few weeks how does that change what do you think you need to do on the investments right so as i think about deposit competition accelerating are there any investments you think you need to make on either the technology or the product side in order to retain and grow deposits and how much of that is embedded in your expense guide clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah thanks manan so right question the good news for us is we undertook the expense cuts so we could make those investments and weve got both on the consumer and commercial side a focus on deposit and customer acquisition technology whether its digital capabilities in consumer things like embedded banking which weve talked about before or other payments capabilities on the commercial side so that costcutting was in part to make room for exactly those types of investments manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc but is there anything additional you need to do given the events of the past few weeks clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp i mean well assess that as we go forward i think we feel wellprepared to handle the deposit challenges in front of the market right now and i think our numbers have shown that i think more than anything were probably likely to be more offensive on the deposit side than weve been to date and we feel well armed to do that manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 got it great and then just on securities i appreciate the detail on the aoci accretion over time i wanted to ask how do you think about the future mix and duration of the securities book just given what weve seen in the past few weeks and just given the potential for higher regulation would you skew the mix of your securities more shorterdated more towards treasuries just want to get a sense of how youre thinking about that clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah its a good question hard to answer in a vacuum but my sense would be youll see higherquality portfolios although ours is pretty high quality today and youll probably see shorter duration or more floaters so it will be interesting to see if thats the way it shakes out the broader impacts of bank security portfolios moving in that direction and how that might impact the market more broadly manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator and next we have a question from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so first on the deposit side so your uninsured deposits are fairly high but it does not appear that you saw a large degree of outflows right that many of your peers saw in the aftermath of silicon valley bank could you comment on that were there notable outflows or because of the operating nature of these accounts which you called out chris was that enough of a factor where you just didnt see what many peers saw christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah just to be clear of our deposits are either insured or collateralized steve so thats point one but i dont know i cant speak to other peoples book like everyone we saw some deposits move out particularly in places like highnetworth individuals we saw some in the smaller end where kind of small business and business banking where basically the deposit is the business and the person are sort of synonymous we saw a couple larger excess deposits move but in general the reason weve enjoyed such stickiness of the deposit is kind of the comments that i made earlier these are operating accounts or businesses and these are businesses that have been clients are key for a long time and frankly there wasnt even a lot of angst i mean we obviously did a good job of reaching out to all of our customers as we always do but i was very pleased with the stickiness of the deposit in the core deposit base keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then chris on the potential for new regulation and you said youre in a good position to organically build capital right in anticipation of new regulations potentially coming do you assume that you need to suspend buybacks for an extended period until we see new regulation in order to build that capital christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yes i dont really plan we dont plan on executing any buybacks until theres clarity as to what the capital framework is going forward so i dont anticipate that well be doing any share repurchases until theres clarity steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks and just one final one in terms of you responding to john pancaris earlier question this hybrid account for commercial customers which is paying interest but its noninterestbearing but youre paying some interest what was the balance in that account or how much are you paying thanks christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah well have to followup i dont have that specific number in front of me but well followup with you steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay sounds good thanks for christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc taking my questions christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah operator and next we go to the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning chris good morning clark keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning gerard clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc chris you touched on in your opening remarks about the thirdparty company that services commercial loans and it gives you an insight into pipelines of what may be coming down the pipe so to speak can you share with us is that company the one that obviously you own are they seeing an increase in activity from commercial mortgages that are in commercial mortgagebacked security products that theyre the special service theyre on and has that started to pick up yet and if not what are they seeing christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp well thanks for your question so basically you have servicing then you have special servicing where youre the named special servicer and then it goes into active special servicing so think of active special servicing as being the workout agent for offus loans whether theyre cmbs or whatever we have seen a huge surge in active servicing and what was the number one just a quarter ago the biggest category was retail and the fastest growing was office and what happened is thats flipped now office is both the fastest growing and its the largest by a significant factor so we do have a pretty good insight we have an insight by class and just so you know office is first and then retail is second and then we also of course have a geographic breakdown because real estate is always geographic so it does give us great insights and it is very dynamic and kind of the trends that we some time ago we said we thought wed see a lot of b and c class office buildings in central business districts and although we for our own book only have like million of that exposure we are seeing that play out and now office is the number one category in active special servicing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and can you remind us i dont know if you have this number in active special servicing i know the fees are greater than your regular servicing by what factor is it a two times higher fee four times higher fee christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp its much higher than four times because you go from getting really kind of just sort of a ticking fee youre actively working on it so it is multiples of what the regular fees are as you go into special servicing and when you look at our financials you can see the bump in that line item keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc which is in the commercial mortgage servicing fee is that correct christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp exactly correct gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then as a followup clark you identified that the provision was hired to build up reserves due to cecl accounting can you share with us some of the metrics maybe i dont know if youre going to use the hpi and the housing price index or unemployment the unemployment rate what were your assumptions in the fourth quarter and how did they change in the first quarter to support the increase in the provision for loan losses clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so let me just start with hpi because thats where you started as i think we may have talked about moodys which we use the moodys consensus they put out an hpi model in  that was updated they still produced their old one we were comfortable with the old one now its just the new one which i would say is fairly draconian and sort of by christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah their hpi clark went from in november to as of february under the moodys consensus clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp so that would be the draconian part of draconian yeah so thats a big mover and largely unemployment went from to so those would be sort of the two big impacted areas gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen we will now be turning the conference for closing remarks back to the ceo chris gorman christopher m gorman chairman president chief executive officer keycorp well i want to thank everyone for joining us today this concludes our first quarter call if you have any questions please as always reach out
