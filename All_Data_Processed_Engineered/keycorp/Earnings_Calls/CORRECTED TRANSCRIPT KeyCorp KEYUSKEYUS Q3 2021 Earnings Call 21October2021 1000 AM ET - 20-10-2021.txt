third quarter revenue which was up from the yearago period our results were driven by growth in both net interest income and noninterest income noninterest income reached a record third quarter keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 level up from the same period last year the increase was driven by broadbased growth across our fee based businesses including investment

business and laurel road through the first nine months of the year our consumer mortgage originations have exceeded 2020s full year record level of billion laurel road had another strong quarter as we continue to add and expand highquality relationships through our national digital bank importantly what really sets laurel road apart is our targeted client approach which results in highvalue digital

highest quarterly level in our history we experienced growth across the entire platform our broad and comprehensive platform has enabled this business to grow consistently over the past decade our investment banking business has grown at an compound annual growth rate over the last years we are on pace to generate doubledigit growth again in expenses this quarter reflect higher productionrelated incentives and the investments we continue to make in our franchise in digital in analytics and in our teammates yeartodate we consolidated branches or approximately of our branch network these consolidations will drive future cost savings and support ongoing investments we will continue to look for opportunities to rightsize our footprint shifting to credit quality our trends remained very strong this quarter nonperforming loans and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter and net chargeoffs to average loans were basis points we continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through all business cycles finally we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders our common equity tier ratio ended the quarter at above our targeted range of to in the third quarter we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program facilitated by the capital relief from the sale of our indirect auto portfolio the accelerated share repurchase program is part of our previously disclosed billion share authorization in total we repurchased million of common stock in the third quarter dividends also remain a priority our dividend yield remains about our board of directors will consider a dividend increase at our meeting next month i will close by restating that it was another strong quarter we generated positive operating leverage by growing our top line and managing expenses while continuing to make investments for our future as always we remain keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 committed to our disciplined approach to risk management and returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases i will now turn the call over to don who will provide more details on the results of the quarter don donald r kimble chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thanks chris im now on slide for the third quarter net income from continuing operations was per common share our results reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses which was largely driven by our strong credit metrics and positive economic outlook importantly we delivered positive operating leverage this quarter and as chris said we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the year total revenues were up compared to the same period last year we had a yearoveryear growth in both net interest income and noninterest income our return on tangible common equity for the quarter was ill cover the other items on this slide later in my presentation turning to slide there were two major items that impacted loan growth this quarter ppp loans and the sale of our indirect auto portfolio average ppp loans declined billion this quarter as we helped clients take advantage of loan forgiveness we also sold our indirect auto portfolio last month the sale impacted our third quarter average results by approximately million and billion on an ending basis average loans were down from the yearago period reflecting a reduction in ppp balances and lower commercial line utilization compared to the prior quarter average loans were down adjusting for the sale of the indirect auto portfolio our loans were up approximately million on average and up over billion on an ending basis adding to the comments on our core loan growth adjusting for both the indirect auto loan sale and ppp loans our linked quarter total loan growth would have been we continue to see strong consumer loan growth driven by laurel road and consumer mortgage on the commercial side we were pleased to see a slight uptick in utilization continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the third quarter of up billion or compared to the yearago period and up from the prior quarter the linked quarter and yearago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances the growth was partially offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits total interestbearing deposit costs came down basis point from the second quarter following a basis point decline last quarter we continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for approximately of our total deposit mix turning to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was billion for the third quarter of compared to billion a year ago and billion from the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the third quarter of compared to for the same period last year and for the prior quarter both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to a yearago period the larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 compared to the prior quarter net interest income increased million and the margin declined basis points lower interestbearing deposit costs and the benefit of the day count were partially offset by lower earning asset yields and continued elevated liquidity levels for the quarter total loan fees from ppp loans were million compared to million last quarter weve also included in the appendix additional detail on our investment portfolio and our asset liability positioning in the third quarter our sensitivity to rising rates moved higher and we ended the period with over billion in cash and shortterm investments moving on to slide we continue to see strong growth in our feebased businesses which have benefited from our ongoing investments noninterest income was million for the third quarter of compared to million for the yearago period and million in the second quarter compared to the yearago period noninterest income increased we had a record third quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees which reached million driven by broadbased growth across the platform including strong ma fees additionally corporate services income increased million and commercial mortgage servicing fees increased million offsetting this growth was lower consumer mortgage fees due to a lower gain on sale margin compared to the second quarter noninterest income increased by million the largest driver of this quarterly increase was the record third quarter investment banking and debt placement fees im now on slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion compared to billion last year and billion in the prior quarter our expense levels reflect higher productionrelated incentives and the investments we have made to drive future growth the increase from the yearago period primarily reflects higher incentive and stockbased compensation attributed to our higher fee production and keys increased stock price the quarteroverquarter increase in expenses was primarily driven by two areas the first personnel expense related to one additional day of salary expense in the quarter and slightly higher employee benefits the second was an increase in other expense of million largely related to a pension settlement charge and higher charitable contributions now moving to slide overall credit quality continues to outperform expectations for the third quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans net chargeoffs in the current quarter included million related to the sale of the indirect auto loan portfolio our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of million this was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics as well as our outlook for the overall economy and loan production nonperforming loans were million this quarter or basis points of periodend loans a decline of million or from the prior quarter now on to slide we ended the third quarter with a common equity tier ratio of which places us above our targeted range of to this provides us with a sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and returning capital to our shareholders importantly we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities we repurchased million of common shares during the quarter and our board of directors approved a third quarter dividend at per common share keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 of the million in common share repurchases million were related to the initial settlement of our accelerated share repurchase program representing of the million authorization the remaining million were purchased in the open market the remaining of the asr will be settled in the fourth quarter on slide similar to prior years weve provided guidance for the fourth quarter relative to our third quarter results guidance ranges are listed at the bottom of the slide importantly using midpoints of this outlook would imply our ppnr is at or above our full year outlook provided last quarter we have adjusted our guidance to reflect our strong third quarter performance especially in our feebased businesses as well as the continued strength in our credit quality average loans will be up lowsingle digits excluding the impact of the sale of our indirect auto portfolio we expect continued growth in both our core commercial and consumer balances average deposits should remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter net interest income is expected to be down lowsingle digits reflecting lower ppp forgiveness in the fourth quarter and the impact of the auto loan sale noninterest income should be relatively stable off our record third quarter performance with momentum in most of our feebased businesses through yearend we will also benefit from what we expect to be another record year for our investment banking business we expect noninterest expense to be down lowsingle digits in the fourth quarter moving on to credit quality we expect our net chargeoff to be below basis points for the fourth quarter credit trends were strong in the third quarter and we expect a strong finish to the year and our guidance for our gaap tax rate has remained unchanged at finally shown at the bottom of this slide are our longterm targets which remain unchanged we expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency which will drive returns overall it was another strong quarter and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders with that i will now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the qa portion of the call operator keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and first from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc id like to start so on the ib and debt placement fees right this has moved from i think you were million per quarter prepandemic now youre running consistently over million per quarter and we know this is an unusual year for debt issuance how should we think about this line over the intermediate term and do we eventually just go back to million christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp so good morning steve its chris as we look at this line we always look at it kind of on a trailing basis i dont think were going back to million in the last decade weve grown this as i mentioned at a compound annual growth rate of we continue to add bankers we continue to further penetrate these niches that were in its a unique business seven industry verticals serving the middle market it is the deal business but having said that we feel really good about the longterm trajectory of the business ill give you one statistic you might find interesting this year we added in terms of incremental bankers and the call activity is up so i think were in the right sectors i think we continue to invest in the business and i think its a unique business i dont think its going back to million i do think over time it will continue to be a doubledigit grower steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so we should consider this current run rate as a baseline chris is that right christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 i dont know if i would consider it as a baseline i mean we always look at it on a trailing basis but i do think we can continue to grow it steve as you know you guys are in the deal business too you cant sort of annualize one quarter but i do think you can look at longterm trends and well continue to grow it steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah got you okay and on the ppp could you guys give out what the fees recognized in the quarter were and maybe don do you have the endofperiod balances on ppp donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp sure can that the total loan fees realized this quarter were million that was down from million last quarter the average balance for ppp loans was billion and the ending was at billion steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful if i could squeeze one more in for you chris there has been quite a bit of activity in ma this year its actually a record year have you been active at all in exploring ma opportunities either bank or nonbank thanks christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp steve were always out there talking to people particularly in the nonbank space we have a pretty good track record of buying entrepreneurial businesses and integrating them obviously this year we bought aqn which is a analytics firm we have a long history of investing in and partnering with fintech companies so well continue to be very very active around sort of niche businesses whether its investment banking boutiques and then were always out there our job is to always be out there in the marketplace and see what there is out there that could create a lot of value so were out there but particularly focused on these niche businesses steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you great thanks for taking my questions christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator and next well go to ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 hey good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess if you could just followup a little bit on the outlook youve talked about positive operating leverage this year as we look beyond you mentioned an opportunity to rightsize the branch footprint give us some perspective on how big that is and as we look forward some of the ppp revenues tail off how do you think about maintaining that positive operating leverage youve heard other banks talk about inflationary pressures impacting expenses so would love your perspective on that christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure well thank you for the question first of all operating leverage is very important to us were really proud of the fact that we have positive operating leverage on a yeartodate basis we will have positive operating leverage for the year we have not yet pulled together our plans for we will share that guidance with everybody in our january call but i can tell you positive operating leverage is a very important part of how we run the business its a huge area of focus when we have all of our business leaders in were investing heavily in these businesses but we have to be able to get the growth for the investment and todate obviously were getting that but well continue to focus on positive operating leverage you mentioned inflationary pressures i dont think there is any question that theres inflationary pressures in the financial services industry and within our customer base we clearly are seeing those and those will be a challenge i think for everyone in the economy ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc all right and i guess one for you indiscernible so looking at your alm slide disclosure at the end just talk to us how are you managing the balance sheet as we think about cash deployment given the steepening in the curves weve seen and where do you want the bank setup months from now in terms of nii sensitivity to basis points higher interest rates donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp its a great question and something we challenge all the time that you might see from the materials that this quarter we had some activity in our bond portfolio with purchases of traditional core investments of about billion compared to a runoff of billion that we saw from the cash flows of the existing portfolio in addition to that we bought some shortterm treasuries of about billion and also the auto securitization transaction ended up increasing our overall bond portfolio by billion as well and so we ended the quarter at about billion of total investments which is up from the average of billion what i would say is that weve seen a nice tickup in rates the purchases we made in the third quarter had an average yield of those same types of investments at the start of the fourth quarter in the to keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 range and so that will probably give us some opportunity to lean a little heavier into portfolio purchases in the fourth quarter and beyond and well continue to assess that were sitting right now on billion of excess liquidity compared with cash positions and shortterm treasuries and we do plan to put that to work over time and probably see a clip of something in that billion to billion range near term instead of a billion that we purchased in the third quarter and maybe moving that up as we get more and more comfortable with where rates are positioned for the long term ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and any changes don on slide i think you lay out billion in portfolio hedges is that whats rolling off is that number expected to stay steady state over the next year donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp yeah of those hedges billion really are true asset liability hedges the remainder are both debt hedges and also some very specific security hedges for the maturities for next months for all thats a billion number as far as the maturity of those swaps and just to put that in perspective the average received fixed rate for those billion in swaps is and the current goto rate for us would be about so were seeing markets start to rates start to pick up and close that gap that we have as far as that rollover risk ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you operator and next well go to scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking my questions christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp hey scott donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 i was hoping you can talk about loan growth for just a second youre certainly starting to see more of a recovery id said the magnitude of yours once you sort of wade through all the noise has maybe been a little bigger than some others out there to the degree things like laurel road and mortgage which you guys have talked about quite a bit offers you some flexibility but i was hoping you could speak to the commercial side and sort of whats differentiating you guys there and maybe some comments about what youre seeing in terms of pricing structure those kinds of things please christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure let me start and then don im sure youll have some comments on this as well we are pleased with the trajectory of our loan growth scott you mentioned on the consumer side our two growth engines those will both continue so we feel good about those as it relates specifically to the commercial side weve seen a lot of activity around energy around affordable housing were significant players in healthcare and technology all of those sectors have been active and the pipelines look strong as it relates to pricing and structure we are not giving on structure at all and i would say there has been sort of a continued erosion of pricing think about sort of from prepandemic to current sort of a tripleb credit an erosion of maybe basis points that would be kind of a good benchmark donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp i would agree chris and as far as the commercial loans linked quarter absent ppp were seeing those balances up over billion so i would say of that about billion is coming from increased utilization rates that we saw is up about basis points we saw a little bit of growth in our commercial real estate portfolio and that really is aided by our focus on affordable housing and some other areas there that have been paying dividend for us and the core commercial portfolio itself grew by about billion and id say that a good chunk of that is coming from customer growth and were seeing the benefit of the additional calling efforts that chris mentioned and the addition of more bankers on the street to help us drive that growth r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you very much and then maybe don just a question on the indirect portfolio sale does that have any bearing on what you think about sort of the steadystate reserve level i cant imagine itll be huge just given the starting size of that portfolio but just would be curious to hear any of your thoughts donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp it really doesnt have a huge impact on it at all if you look at the reserve levels we have there theyre a little bit less than the average for the overall loan book but generally in line so not much of a change there the one thing we continue to watch is that our credit metrics continue to improve and exceed our expectations as far as the relative performance there and so thats been the main driver as far as some of the adjustments weve seen down as far as our overall reserve levels r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah perfect all right thank you guys for taking the questions keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thanks scott christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you operator next well go to bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning chris and don christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc wanted to followup on the operating leverage dynamics implicit specifically in the investment banking fee income line item clearly there is a relationship between that fee income and how you compensate your producers but how does the rate of growth in revenues in that line item compare to the corresponding expenses over time how accretive is it to your consolidated operating leverage donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp yeah i would say that historically weve seen that operating margin hold in fairly well for that business even though weve been investing in it as we see variances from quartertoquarter we typically see an increase in incentive compensation to about of the change in revenues and while its not a strict formula it tends to work out to be about that range and i would say as far as the efficiency ratio for this business its a little higher than what the core would be overall but isnt too dilutive to the entire company bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thats helpful and then separately can you give a little bit of color on how youd expect laurel roads mortgage volumes and mix to evolve in a higher mortgage rate environment christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah so bill thanks for your question so just as you step back and you look at our mortgage business broadly right now about of our volume is to doctors so its not an inconsequential piece across all of key additionally our purchase volume right now is about were up yearoveryear i think the mba would say those are relatively flat so i would expect that well continue to grow fairly aggressively on the purchase side keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 as it relates to laurel road and obviously as interest rates go up the refinance piece of it will obviously be impacted by that donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp and also keep in mind our target customer for this laurel road business it really is those doctors that are coming off the residency and locating to their permanent assignment and so step one typically is to consolidate their student loans and step two would be to buy a house and establish more of a permanent residence and so even if rates are going up we would expect to see some strong purchase volume coming from that targeted customer base as well bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it if i may squeeze in one last one was the strategic rationale behind exiting of the indirect auto lending business simply a result of your desire to focus on direct relationships with your customers and with that sale have you now fully exited indirect consumer lending christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah so bill there is no question youre correct there i mean we are a relationship bank and specifically we believe in targeted scale and if you think about that being really focused on who you do business with and being a relationship bank clearly the indirect auto business just is not a relationship business and so we made the decision to exit the business and then the transaction that we completed just recently with the accelerated share repurchase just made a whole lot of sense for us because it freed up capital had a great irr and frankly enabled us to eliminate the tail risk at a time when the value of used automobiles was quite high so that was kind of the strategic logic between exiting the business and executing the transaction we did recently bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood that makes a lot of sense thank you for taking my questions donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp sure thank you operator our next question is from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey thanks good morning don just a followup on the swap comment you gave that billion number and talked about it but i just wanted to understand the broader strategy with the swap book the billion now and that billion just wondering just how youre thinking about either replacing some of those and if you could remind us what the benefit was from hedge income hedge swap income in this quarter and how youd expect that to traject thank you keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp yeah sounds good the whole thought as to the size of the swap book is really to get to the end target as far as our asset sensitivity that we have been biasing our position to be much more asset sensitive than we typically would were now in our we talk about a asset sensitive position in our slide deck and thats higher than where wed be traditionally but also available to us going forward into next year is the redeployment of liquidity so some of that will be talking out the cash position which is a variable rate asset lowearning variable rate asset but still variable rate and replacing it with longdated investment securities and we typically have about a fouryear average life for those securities and so well have to take that in consideration as to whether or not we just do more of that or we do additional replacements of the swaps right now weve not been replacing any of the swap maturities and well continue to reassess that going forward so thats just generally how we would manage the overall asset sensitivity position of the company as far as the benefit from the swaps in the third quarter we had about million of net interest income coming from the swaps we could see that come down slightly over the next couple of quarters and then the question will be going forward is what happens with rates and as a shortterm rates move up youd see that number come down but we would have seen an offsetting impact from the rates on the commercial loans going up benefiting from those higher rates and so thats again just a summary of where were positioned today and what the impacts there might be going forward ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah and as a followup so if you were to just let lets say all of that the billion go and not replace do you have an idea of where that asset sensitivity would turn into donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp i would say that that would probably take us up as far as asset sensitivity but i dont have the exact rate there and one of the things weve been monitoring is just what our outlook would be for rates overall and whats the other changes in the balance sheet so since those swaps are fairly short in duration it wouldnt have a huge impact in overall asset sensitivity but this is something prospectively that wed have to evaluate ken usdin q analyst jefferies company understood and if i could just ask the last clarifying one don can you just give us what the total ppp income was this quarter versus last donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp the total which include the interest on the individual loans was million including the million in fees last quarter that was million including million of fees and so just the relative change from quarter to quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies company perfect thank you don keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator next well go to matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning matt matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc a couple of followups on some individual fee categories service charges for you guys and others are bouncing back nicely do you think thats obviously from seasonality and just kind of inherent recovery but do you think it might also be a bit of a leading indicator that some consumers are spending down their excess liquidity and can start borrowing more or what do you think is driving that donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp well one if we look at the individual balances of our retail customers were seeing balances maintained if not growing across the board even the smallest customers as far as average deposit balances and so were not seeing a lot of change there i would say that to your point some seasonality some activity level were seeing activity levels pick up and thats driving service charges up and more importantly for us is were seeing household and customer growth and weve had record growth for the first nine months of this year that exceeds what we had previously originated as far as net new households in a full year and so were seeing strong growth there which also does translate to increased fee activity for us as well christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah matt just to give you some numbers from the first quarter of our merchant business is up purchase cards up retail payments in general are up so to dons point there is a lot of velocity matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then separately the trust fees were down a little bit and flat linked quarter and flat yearoveryear obviously a good backdrop in markets just whats going on there and then remind us how much money market waivers are embedded in those results as well for when run rates rise and you recover that thank you donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 yeah as far as the trust fee income the biggest driver there really was commercial brokerage activity and that was down linked quarter and yearoveryear if you look at the core private banking revenues those were up for each of those periods and retail investment sales are down slightly linked quarter because of seasonality but thats up yearoveryear and so those are the main drivers there and then im sorry matt as far as your last question i forget what that was i apologize matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc any money market waivers that are embedded in that line that when rates rise youll recover donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp really dont have any money market waivers there at all we dont manage any money market funds and so that really doesnt trip our revenues there matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thanks for the reminder donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator next question is from peter winter with wedbush securities please go ahead peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc chris i wanted to ask on the capital just wondering with the improved credit risk profile the outlook for the economy is getting better would you consider moving the capital target maybe to the low end of to or even take it below the low end christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp peter we still believe that to is the right number as we think about our business theres obviously a lot of variables could we be in the lower portion of to depending on the scenario we could but we do not intend to lower the target of to of cet1 keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and then just don if i can ask just in terms of the fourth quarter outlook could you talk about the average loan growth in the net interest income excluding ppp and then also with the net interest income excluding the impact of the sale of the indirect auto donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp sure could that as far as the average loan growth that weve talked about up lowsingle digits up to excluding the impact of the indirect auto if we added on the impact of the ppp forgiveness and loan balance expectations there that would add another billion to the overall loan growth so almost so that would take it from a lowsingle digit to a midsingle digit kind of growth expectation on a linkedquarter basis and so something similar to what we reported essentially this quarter as far as the nii outlook i would say that theres two things that are impacting nii outlook for the fourth quarter you hit on one which is ppp and we would expect probably in the neighborhood of million or so type of decline in ppp revenues the other is the indirect auto loan sale that as a result of the sale our net interest income will be down but our fee income will be up where we essentially receive basis points for servicing those loans and so you will see a decline in nii of about million and an increase of fee income in the range of million to help offset that and those are kind of the moving parts and pieces peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks for taking my questions donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator next well go to eric chan with wells fargo securities please go ahead eric chan q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi guys i have a question that relates to tech so as you guys have retooled the bank i was just wondering if you could speak a little bit about how the role of fintech partnerships have changed for key and if possible perhaps you could give us a number of fintech partners that you guys currently work with christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure eric thanks for your question so our relationship with fintech partners has really been both important and helpful for us as a bank we were in early and i think its really helped us successfully execute our targeted scale strategy frankly its helped us kind of with our client service strategy our sales strategy its also clearly contributed to our thinking as we developed our technology road map we are clearly tied into the entire fintech ecosystem and our unique strategy is both known and understood by the fintech community which is helpful keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 going to your question of how many relationships we have i would say today we have probably clientfacing relationships we literally have dozens of infrastructure relationships with fintechs because were sort of known in the whole ecosystem we see a lot maybe or opportunities every single month that we kind of sort through kind of if you step back and take a look and think about kind of from a strategic perspective our targeted scale strategy just makes us a great partner because we have such a distinct client groups and obviously as youre developing software thats really helpful what we have done at key is in laurel road is weve built this national digital affinity bank which is a relationship approach to digital banking what fintechs really are best at is really solving one pain point and doing it extremely well so its been a good relationship probably for i can certainly say for us and im sure its been a good relationship for the fintechs as well eric chan q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah thats helpful and then just kind of a followup on to that so how do you guys determine which strategy to follow when it comes to actually building inhouse or partnering with fintechs so to say just kind of like on a high level what are your thoughts there christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah it starts with the client out we are a relationshipdriven bank and so we have these distinct client groups that were pursuing and to the extent we can partner invest with a fintech that can make us more impactful in the market serving that specific client set we will enter into some partnership well invest in them to the extent it doesnt help us compete and win in the marketplace and solve a specific pain point for our targeted customers we take a pass now as i mentioned thats on the clientfacing stuff in the infrastructure space we have dozens and dozens and obviously the criteria there is is it cheaper and faster to buy it versus build it eric chan q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks so much donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator next question is from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi chris hi don donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys give us some color credit obviously has been great for you and your peers you have already given us guidance for the second quarter net chargeoff number which is lower than your longterm numbers that you have for to basis points through the cycle when do you think we start creeping up for a normality and im not talking about a recession but do you think you stay at this lower level for another quarter or two and then we start creeping up later in or into christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp let me take a pass at that gerard the answer is we dont know weve got really good clarity obviously as we look into the fourth quarter we gave guidance of basis points interestingly enough our results this quarter while we report basis points its really closer to basis points when you take out the million that relates to indirect auto i think we are in i can speak for key i think the derisking that weve gone about for the last years is going to serve us extremely well we wont stay at a level this low but i actually think as we look into you are still going to see us below our targeted range of to basis points donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp and gerard i would agree with chris comments there are a couple of things to think about one is that as far as our overall credit quality position for many of the metrics today were actually better than what we were pre pandemic so if you look at nonperforming loans nonperforming assets the delinquency stats for consumer and commercial loans are all better than where they were prepandemic our criticized and classified are a little higher than what they were before the pandemic but coming down dramatically and weve seen incremental improvements this quarter that are outpacing what wed seen before that and so that would suggest that things are going to be good for some time but at the same time i would think that youre probably going to see the consumer start to turn a little sooner theyve been the beneficiary of so much stimulus and if that starts to slow and go away like we would expect it to you would start to see some of that start to return to more normal levels over time as well and then the commercial customer while its still flush with liquidity but we just arent seeing the early signs of that there is going to be some challenges down the road and so i think that were going to be in a period for some time where were going to see chargeoffs below the low end of guidance ranges across the industry christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp i think gerard one of the first things youll see is in the small business sector the inability to pass through what are some pretty significant price and wage increases and i think that will be the beginning of a bit of a pressure on the commercial side particularly with smaller customers that have less pricing power keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as the followup chris two things one when you look at your investment banking numbers which of course were very strong record levels million can you give us a flavor for how does that break out ma advisory versus dcm et cetera and compare that to first quarter last year but then second in your prepared bullets it looked like you pointed out that you retained of the business on the loans and i thought that seemed high because normally i thought you sold of it or more off but if and in those two questions thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so gerard weve never broken out each of the different components our investment banking fees i can tell you that our ma business was extremely strong and you can imagine the equity business was very strong given that we have a focus on technology so those were a couple just bright spots broadly as it relates to our mix of whats distributed and what we put on our balance sheet its actually been very consistent over a long period of time weve always basically held of the credits that we take on weve always held about on our balance sheet so we really havent dialed that up at all weve been just maintaining our moderate risk profile and taking advantage of what are some pretty attractive markets out there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you so much operator and next well go to john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi i appreciate the color youve given around the loan growth activity that youre seeing im curious how youre thinking that interprets into in terms of the type of onbalance sheet loan growth that you could see just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color on how youre thinking about that and curious how that could play into the full year thanks keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp john thanks for your question we will be addressing our view on in january but whats interesting about our model is there is a lot of variables and depending on what the market conditions are you could see us just going back to the previous question you could see us maybe putting more on our balance sheet if some of the markets went in theyre right now functioning very very well went into dislocation but well have a specific view for you when we report in january john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right chris thanks and then separately on the expense side i know weve youve talked about wage inflation and how are you thinking about what it could to expense levels as you look at full year expectations i know youre not giving guidance but around the wage inflation topic specifically just curious about annualized expense impact how you think about that christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah so the biggest impact todate for us has obviously been those variable structures principally in investment banking and in our mortgage business that are driven by business flows and the fact that those businesses have grown your question is a good one in that we have had to particularly at the low end of the entry level in throughout key and also in kind of the junior banker area we have in fact had to increase wages there and don can you give us some specifics on what the impact of that is on an annualized basis donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp well our total salary expense each year is about billion and i would say that those two components probably have cost us somewhere in the range of about million to million a year so its a little over cost as far as the impact there overall but its something well continue to evaluate and as chris highlighted that were seeing that in the entry level type of positions and were also starting to see some of that in other more specialty areas as well and so well have to assess as we go into next year what kind of targets well have as far as salary expense overall john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it but that million to million per year thats mainly on the lowerend wages and the junior banker areas donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp you got it yes john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay all right and then lastly just one question around your tech side of the shop just curious in terms of if you can update us on the size of your tech budget and how thats been growing annually and then perhaps how much is split between growing the bank versus running the bank thanks keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so broadly our spend is about million a year of that about million is spent on development of the million about half of it is client facing the other half is core one of the great things is weve been updating our core technology over a long period of time and we actually have to spend a little less in that category which frees up more dollars for some of the development on the front end the other thing that we also have been doing is weve been buying a lot of niche businesses that have actually brought a lot of technology to us obviously laurel road would be an example of that aqn would be an example of that and thats really tech investment that is outside of what we would think about in terms of our tech budget john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it very helpful thanks chris christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure operator and with no further questions ill turn the call
