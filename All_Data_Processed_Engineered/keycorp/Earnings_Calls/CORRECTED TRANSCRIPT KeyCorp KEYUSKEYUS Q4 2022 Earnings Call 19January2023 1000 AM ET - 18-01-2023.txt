management discussion section operator good morning and welcome to keycorps fourth quarter earnings conference call as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to the chairman and ceo chris gorman please go ahead christopher m gorman chairman president chief executive officer keycorp well thank you for joining us for keycorps fourth quarter earnings conference call joining me on the call today are don kimble our chief financial officer clark khayat our chief strategy officer upon dons planned retirement clark will assume the cfo role and also mark midkiff our chief risk officer on slide you will find our statement on forwardlooking disclosure and nongaap financial measures it covers our presentation materials and comments as well as the questionandanswer segment of our call i am now moving to slide this morning we reported our earnings of million or per common share our results included million of provision for credit losses which exceeded net chargeoffs by million or a share the additional provision builds our allowance for credit losses adjusting our credit models to reflect a more cautious economic outlook keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 our results reflect continued growth in both our consumer and commercial businesses in our consumer business we have added new households with younger clients being our fastestgrowing segment our commercial business also has continued to add and expand relationships in we raised a record level of capital for our clients net interest income was up from the third quarter reflecting continued relationshipbased loan growth supported by stable deposits deposit costs continued to move higher with a step up in deposit rates late in the quarter at the end of the fourth quarter nearly of our deposits were in lowcost retail and escrow balances in our commercial businesses over of our deposits are from core operating accounts our average loan balances increased from the prior quarter as we continue to add relationships and offer the best execution with both on and off balance sheet solutions we continue to benefit from investments we have made in our business including the healthcare sector in we continue to grow relationships with significant healthcare providers and expanded our laurel road business despite the student loan payment holiday we originated over billion of laurel road loans last year and increased our member household by over additionally we expanded our offering to nurses added new products and capabilities and completed the acquisition of gradfin since acquisition gradfin has held nearly individual consultations for refinance and public service loan forgiveness these consultations are with prequalified credential prospects all new to key our feebased businesses in the fourth quarter reflect the continued slowdown in capital markets activity and the impact of changes to our nsfod fee structure investment banking and debt placement fees were up million from the prior quarter but down meaningfully from the year ago period reflecting broader capital markets trends the new issue equity market is virtually nonexistent and the ma market continues to be engaged in price discovery our pipelines remain solid particularly in ma however the pullthrough rates continue to be adversely impacted by market uncertainty we have also continued to see more activity moving on to our balance sheet in we raised a record billion of capital for our clients of which was retained on our balance sheet well above our longterm average of credit quality remained strong this quarter with net chargeoffs as a percentage of average loans up basis points nonperforming loans declined again this quarter and delinquencies criticized and classified loans all remained near historically low levels we will continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile which positions the company to perform well through all business cycles our capital remains a strength providing us with sufficient capacity to support our clients and return capital to our shareholders including a increase in our common stock dividend in the fourth quarter before i turn the call over to don i want to share some thoughts on our outlook and priorities for and beyond first we will continue to execute on our differentiated business model and strategy we will focus on expanding our presence in our fastest growing markets and targeted industry verticals as we demonstrated again in we are uniquely positioned to support clients through various market conditions secondly we will continue to benefit from our balance sheet and interest rate positioning we have been very deliberate and intentional in the manner in which we have managed our interest rate risk with a longer term perspective although our positioning is providing less current benefit we have significant upside over the next two years as swaps and shortterm treasuries mature and reprice if we were to reprice our existing shortterm keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 treasuries and swaps at todays interest rates we would have an annualized net interest income benefit of billion thirdly we will maintain our strong credit quality weve spent the last decade derisking our portfolio positioning the company to outperform through the business cycle despite our strong credit metrics we built our loan loss reserve this quarter which using our net chargeoff outlook now represents almost five years of coverage to put this in perspective our reserve is now above our cecl day one level while nonperforming loans and delinquencies are roughly one half of our prepandemic levels finally we will continue to create capacity to make targeted investments in our business by reducing expenses although expense management has been an ongoing area of focus we will be accelerating our cost takeout plans early in we will pursue cost opportunities across our company including areas where we can leverage technology automation and process improvement to reduce redundancy improve efficiency and enhance effectiveness our targets represent a cost reduction of approximately relative to our full year level the acceleration of our expense reduction plans will benefit us in two ways first we cannot grow if we are not investing this will give us the capacity to continue to drive our targeted scale strategy investing in points of differentiation with the benefit of our cost reduction plans we expect to hold expenses relatively stable this year compared to our full year results which would be a significant accomplishment given inflationary pressures and our commitment to continue to invest in our future i am confident in our longterm outlook and our ability to create value for all of our stakeholders with that ill turn it over to don to provide more details on the results for the quarter and our outlook don donald r kimble chief financial administrative officer keycorp thanks chris im now on slide for the fourth quarter net income from continuing operations was per common share down from the prior quarter and down from last year our results included per share of additional loan loss provision in excess of net chargeoffs as we continue to build our reserves reflecting a more cautious economic outlook for the full year we delivered positive operating leverage marking our ninth time in the last years this is a testament to our differentiated and resilient business model and our ongoing focus on disciplined expense management despite inflationary environment turning to slide average loans for the quarter were billion up from the year ago period and up from the prior quarter as we continue to add and deepen client relationships across our franchise commercial loans increased from the year ago quarter driven by growth in commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate balances relative to the year ago period consumer loans increased reflecting growth in consumer mortgage and laurel road compared with the third quarter of commercial loans grew and consumer loans were up our commercial growth continues to reflect the strength in our targeted industry verticals and higher line utilization our consumer business continues to benefit from residential real estate originations which were just under billion for the fourth quarter approximately onethird of our originations came from targeted healthcare professionals keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 continuing onto slide average deposits totaled billion for the fourth quarter of down from the year ago period and up billion or compared to the prior quarter yearoveryear we saw declines in non operating commercial deposit balances and retail deposits the increase in deposit balances from the prior quarter reflect higher commercial deposits due to seasonality and our focus on maintaining relationship business consumer balances declined in the quarter driven by inflationary spending and the movement of interest of rate sensitive balances interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points from the prior quarter and our cumulative deposit beta was since the fed began raising interest rates in march of we continue to view our strong deposit base as a competitive strength with approximately of our balances and core consumer and escrow deposits in addition over of our commercial deposits were from core operating accounts turning to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was billion for the fourth quarter compared to billion in the year ago period and billion in the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the fourth quarter compared to in the same period last year and for the prior quarter yearoveryear net interest income and net interest margin benefited from higher earning asset balances and higher interest rate quarteroverquarter net interest income and the net interest margin were negatively impacted by higher interest bearing deposit costs and a change in the funding mix later in the quarter we experienced changing market conditions and customer behavior market rates increased more than we expected and the migration from noninterestbearing to interestbearing commercial deposits ticked up this resulted in a higher deposit beta lowerthanexpected net interest income and net interest margin our outlook for has our cumulative deposit beta peaking in the mid to high range well below our historic levels included in the appendix is additional information on our future net interest income opportunities and asset liability position based on our feedback from our shareholders we have also included detail on maturities of our interest rate swaps and shortterm treasury security as chris mentioned in his remarks weve been very intentional in the way we manage interest rate risk with a longterm perspective although our position has provided less near term benefit we have significant upside over the next two years as our swaps and shortterm treasuries mature and reprice we expect this to drive both our net interest income and our net interest margin higher over the next few years we believe this is a true differentiator moving to slide noninterest income was million for the fourth quarter of compared to for the year ago period and million in the third quarter the decline in noninterest income from the fourth quarter of reflects a 151million decline in investment banking and debt placement fees along with a 35million reduction in other income primarily from market related gains from the year ago period additionally service charges on deposits were million lower due to changes in our nsfod structure that we implemented in september as well as lower consumer mortgage income down million partially offsetting these declines was an increase in corporate services income up million due to higher derivatives income relative to the prior quarter noninterest income declined million service charge on deposit accounts accounted for the majority of the decline down million once again reflecting our new nsfod fee terms additionally corporate services income decreased million driven keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 primarily from an evaluation adjustment benefit in the prior quarter and investment banking fees increased million im now on to slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion down million from the year ago period and up million from the last quarter our expenses reflect our ongoing investments in digital analytics and our teammates compared to the year ago quarter we saw declines across most nonpersonnel line items including business services and professional fees and operating lease expense personnel expense remained flat compared to year ago period reflecting higher salaries and employee benefits offset by lower incentive and stockbased compensation compared to the prior quarter noninterest expense is up million higher nonpersonnel cost drove most of the increase other expense increased million reflecting a pension settlement charge in the fourth quarter also professional fees were higher in the quarter some of which were temporary in nature personnel expense also increased reflecting lower deferred costs from slower loan originations moving on to slide overall credit quality remained strong for the fourth quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points on average loans which remained near historic low levels nonperforming loans were million this quarter or basis points of periodend loans a decline of million from the prior quarter our provision for credit losses was million for the fourth quarter which exceeded net chargeoffs by million the excess provision increases our allowance from credit losses reflecting a more cautious model driven assumption set for our cecl modeling we start with moodys consensus scenario this quarter the consensus estimates reflected a marked slowdown in the economy and meaningful reductions in home prices both of which impacted our allowance levels despite the increases in the allowance our outlook for net chargeoffs in are basis points to basis points remains well below our throughthecycle loss levels of basis points to basis points now on to slide we ended the fourth quarter with common equity tier ratio of within our targeted range of to this provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and to return capital to our shareholders we will continue to manage our capital consistent with our capital priorities but first supporting organic growth in our business second paying dividend in the fourth quarter our board of directors approved a increase which now places our dividend at per common share per quarter and finally repurchasing shares our current share repurchase authorization of million is in place through the third quarter of we did not complete any share repurchases in the fourth quarter on slide is our full year outlook the guidance is relative to our full year results importantly using the midpoint of our guidance ranges with result in another year of positive operating leverage in we expect average loans will be up between and and average deposits will be flat to down net interest income is expected to be up between and reflecting growth in average loan balances and higher interest rates our guidance is based on the forward curve assuming a fed funds rate peaking at in the first quarter and starting to decline in the fourth quarter these interest rate assumptions along with our expectations for customer behavior and competitive pricing environment are very fluid and will continue to impact our outlook prospectively noninterest income is expected to be down to reflecting the implementation of our new nsfod fee structure last year and continued challenging capital markets activities at least for the first half of the year we expect noninterest expense to be relatively stable with the benefit of the cost takeout opportunities chris described in his remarks along with ongoing investments that we will make in our business keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 for the year we expect credit quality to remain strong and net chargeoffs will be in the 25basis point to 30basis point range well below to the throughthecycle range of basis points to basis points our guidance for our gaap tax rate is approximately to finally shown at the bottom of our slide are our longterm targets which remain unchanged we expect to continue to make progress on these targets by maintaining our moderate risk profile and improving our productivity and efficiency which will drive returns overall it was a solid quarter and a very good finish to another successful year for key we remain confident in our ability to grow and deliver on each of our longterm targets with that ill now turn the call back over to the operator for instructions for the qa portion of the call operator question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc i know you mentioned that you saw a step up in deposit rates late in the fourth quarter i wonder if you could give us a little more detail of what products and the magnitude that you saw maybe your how you see that following through and then related to that you also said that higher than expected pressure on deposit cost as well not just a step up but a greater than expected amount of pressure and just trying to get a feel on around what area surprised you and why do you think given the outlook around deposit pressures and rates what was what attributed to the surprise there thanks donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp sure can john and as far as late in the quarter and late november december we started to see a different migration pattern as far as some of the deposits and the rates we saw market conditions start to pick up as far as rates and many products our expectation coming into the quarter was continuing to drift up some of the money market rates on deposits but the customers were migrating more towards time deposits which had a higher incremental cost than what our assumptions were as far as money market deposit accounts keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 we also saw a shift away from noninterestbearing account at a faster pace than what we would have expected late in the quarter and so both of those had an impact of driving net interest income down for the current quarter compared to what we would have expected even coming into the end of the quarter and its also reflected in our outlook going forward and clark i dont know if you want to offer up any thoughts as far as trends going forward as far as the deposit rates and betas and what have you clark h i khayat a chief strategy officer executive vice president keycorp sure thanks don a little bit more just to get to your question john a little more pressure on the commercial side than the consumer side which would not be unexpected we did see as don mentioned a rotation out of noninterestbearing to interestbearing and we saw the ending balance of noninterestbearing around thats a little bit of seasonality and weve seen that come back thats a ratio kind of high that we would expect through the year and thats a little bit better than where weve been historically which would have been sort of mid in terms of the products and rates as don said cds coming through wed expect the betas for the year to be mid to high as don said in his prepared remarks and again a little bit more movement to cds than money markets that we expected but weve factored that in and again thats sort of stable high noninterestbearing ratio for the year christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp john its chris its interesting customer behavior is really hard to model we wouldnt have expected that the cumulative beta for the first three quarters would have ever been as low as and as we got to the end of the year it really accelerated and a lot of it was on the commercial side a lot of it were excess deposits in places like our private banking area so its been interesting this has been the steepest rate of increases in the feds history and i think some of the conventional curves are sort of out the window john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thanks chris that helps and then i know you mentioned the need for investment in the year youre focusing on ratcheting up investments in certain areas so i just want to see if you can give us additional color on what changed there in terms of areas that youre investing in that necessitated a greater pull back in costs elsewhere thanks christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp yeah so its really a continuation of the investments john that weve been making and the point i was making there was were not going to cease to invest as we take out costs and when we were at investor day a year ago we talked about growing our consumers by by focusing really on our growth markets and were having a lot of success with our younger customers and were going to continue to focus on both products and marketing in that regard also we talked about hiring bankers we talked about we think we had these unique platforms that are underleveraged and we talked about increasing our banker population by by admittedly last year we tapered off in the back half of the year the market was obviously overheated and also frankly we saw the keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 downturn coming in the economy we think it will be a very good environment to recruit and successfully bring people onto the platform going forward and then lastly was laurel road and the commitment we made around laurel road where weve continued to invest is that we were going to grow our members from to this year we successfully grew by and weve made a lot of investments expanding to nurses having a full product line there buying gradfin being a leader in public service loan forgiveness and were also going to get into the incomebased forgiveness game as well so those are the three areas and so it wasnt really new investments so much its a continuation of the investments weve made in critical areas of the business including around things like continuing to migrate to the cloud and investing in digital john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay chris now that helps clarify that appreciate it and thats it from me and best of luck to you don donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning can you give us some more color on the reserve build this quarter to your point your nco guide for is well below your longterm target so i guess what changed in the macro environment that necessitated the reserve build and i guess is this you being a lot more conservative and should we expect the reserve ratio to stabilize from here or could there be factors that drive that reserve ratio higher christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure manan first of all thank you for your question and youre right despite the fact that we have really good credit metrics we did in fact build the reserve and so if you kind of step back for a second kind of look at the macro perspective we believe the economy is clearly slowing we think the probability of a recession has increased from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of last year our base case by the way is that there will be a mild recession there is really three drivers of the cecl reserve the first is the macro view which i just described which is the driver for us the second is loan growth and we actually have some loan growth the third is really idiosyncratic risks specific portfolio specific credit that is not driving our reserve build at all so just to kind of bring it to life for you from the third to the fourth quarter as we look at our model we looked at gdp declining by about twothirds from sort of to unemployment going from say in the third quarter we thought it would peak at we now think it will peak around but significantly when we look at things like home price index in the third quarter we thought homes were going up by in the fourth quarter as we modeled it it was a decline of so fairly significant quarteroverquarter change of keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 now to bring it back to kind of our portfolio we for example have billion of mortgages thats about of our loan book booking about the fico scores on those are say from memory or some such number we also say that of our mortgages are or above and i share this texture for you because we are not worried about our mortgage book but as we drive our cecl models which are forwardlooking the macro drivers have significant impact and im just using that as an example for why the reserve build does that answer your question manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah thats really helpful thanks so much for the color and then if you could just round that out with how youre thinking about the nim and just managing the nim as you go to earlier on you were in the camp of the feds keeping rates higher for longer has that changed and has that changed how youre managing youre putting on any additional swaps or hedges on the books donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp sure as far as how were managing it right now our assumption set is basically that we would just continue at this point in time to replace rolloff of swaps that we have were continuing to evaluate that i think the challenge that we all have is just with this inverted yield curve is when do you pull the trigger to start to lock in some of that rollover risk and outlook and so right now weve not embedded any of that into our base assumptions but that its something that well continue to have as optionality to take care of that in the future manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks so much donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning ebrahim keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just wanted to follow up on credit so you talked about the consumer book and the ficos when we look at the commercial book both on the ci cre just talk to us about the idiosyncratic risks i mean the leverage lending book you provide on slide is relatively small but when we think about the impact from higher rates pulling demand and you talked about mild recession as your base case like where within the cre and the ci portfolios do you expect delinquencies to start moving higher and where is the loss content christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure well ebrahim thanks for the question so you started at the right place where we focus we focus any place where there is leverage and obviously if you think about leverage finance which by the way for us is only about of an entire loan book and its focused in our seven industry verticals and it has a pretty high turnover but youre exactly right where there is leverage and you go into a mild recession and you have declining ebitda you have to watch that very closely we feel good about that portfolio nothing has bubbled up to the surface but as you can imagine were modeling it very very regularly the next area that you mentioned which i think is really appropriate is real estate and real estate is an area that we look at closely what weve done with our real estate business is we completely rebuilt it around a business thats not we now have put real estate loans on our books but we also distribute a lot of paper so its a little bit of a different business than a lot of our competitors have fannie freddie fha the like companies the cmbs market etcetera so we distribute a lot of risks were also focused on very specifically on certain asset classes and the certain asset classes that were focused on first and foremost multifamily in its broadest sense but within multifamily on affordable housing were watching those closely so far the rent uptakes are good the rents are still holding firm so we feel really good about that portfolio the portfolio that we look at very closely and fortunately we have very little of it theres actually two portfolios the first is b and c class office space in central business districts right now were down to million but were watching that very closely because those buildings are multitenant buildings and the reality is whether its key cutting expenses and getting rid of occupancy cost or any other business i think thats a real risk going forward so were watching that closely the other area where we only have about billion of exposure is in the retail and retail is an area where we keep a close eye so thats kind of how were thinking about it and as you can imagine we are continually modeling this portfolio as we look at that delta between where theyre borrowing and where their debt rolls over ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i think in there you mentioned that youre actively derisking some of these loans whats the market for that in terms of being able to get out of some of these credits without having to take a big marktomarket or credit charge christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 there hasnt been there really hasnt been a lot of movement yet i think people were still just like in the ma environment i think people are in price discovery obviously if you take my example of b and c class office theres a lot of people that have impaired equity but i think people are going to have to frankly endure some more pain before theres a meeting of the minds on kind of how to restructure how to bring in fresh equity etcetera ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one question don on nii do you think the mid to high beta is conservative enough im just wondering in a world of plus fed funds qt like a lot of banks are kind of nudging their expectations a bit higher do you think that sets you up for more downside risk over the next few quarters just give us a sense of your comfort level with that beta guidance donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp ill go ahead and offer some thoughts and then ask clark to go ahead and chime in as well but i would say that keep in mind that as chris mentioned earlier we really were kind of bestinclass for the first few quarters of this rate increase cycle that our cumulative deposit beta is at most of the peers im seeing are closer to the already we did do a thorough scrub as to where we see rate is going and i think what youre seeing and why we have confidence in our deposit beta assumptions is the fact that we have shifted our priority and focus over to more primacy both on the commercial and consumer side and we think that will continue to pay dividend for it as far as keeping our overall deposit costs down clark anything you would add there clark h i khayat a chief strategy officer executive vice president keycorp yeah the other point i would add is just that its less for us about new deposit acquisition were always going to acquire deposits from new clients and new relationships but a lot of what were looking at this year is managing clients from product to product and that just allows us a little bit more flexibility on pricing christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp ebrahim the only thing i would add i agree with everything that don and clark said the thing that i will share with you though this is sort of uncharted territory and while were really pleased with the trajectory of our deposit betas were not going to win the deposit battle deposit beta battle and lose the win the beta battle and lose the deposit more because its very important that we serve our clients and we keep them here at key ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah makes sense all right thank you very much donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning steve donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start on the loan outlook if i look at where period end and average loans end in it appears that youre not looking for much loan growth in on a period end basis can you confirm that and maybe give some color on why such a sluggish outlook i dont know if youre tightening your credit box or whatnot donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp steve this is don and as far as the outlook the period end balance sometimes can be a little misleading so if you just take a look at the fourth quarter average for total loans at billion our midpoint of our guidance range is in the 120million range and all of that really is coming from commercial and so with this change in our economic outlook that also influenced our or determined what our allowance was weve also pulled back on some of those loan growth outlook we also see steve that our consumer loan balances are flat throughout next year and what our expectation there is that well continue to have residential mortgage origination that well continue to see some of the home equity balances trade down and relatively flat on other consumer categories and so it is very modest incremental growth from here but we think its appropriate given the backdrop of the economic outlook we have steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay don thats helpful and then on the reserve build if the reserve build was a change in the economic assumptions and not idiosyncratic risk why did the specific reserve not go up materially in some of these consumer categories i know theyre smaller but home equity consumer direct card i would have thought if youd changed your unemployment rate etcetera we would have seen an increase in those as well donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp one of the biggest things that chris talked about were that the larger moves were the gdp coming down and also the home price index and so what you would have seen is the residential real estate back credits having a larger increase than some of the others you also factor in the position that our delinquency levels and our credit size and class levels are still very benign and i think thats why youre not seeing some of those other higher risk category showing increased reserves because were not seeing the migration of those portfolios at this point in time keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks a lot if i could squeeze one more and just looking at the nii guidance you have to i know you said mid to high range for deposit beta but what is the assumption is it mid or high thats underlying this guidance range and what are you assuming the mix of noninterestbearing is by the end of thanks clark h i khayat a chief strategy officer executive vice president keycorp yeah hey steve its clark so the mid to high question is sort of mid to high 27ish area for the year on the beta and then the noninterestbearing percentage is roughly high for the year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so staying pretty flat okay great thanks for taking my question clark h i khayat a chief strategy officer executive vice president keycorp indiscernible just was a little bit lower for seasonality on average steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thanks a lot donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi guys donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp hi christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 don i think you mentioned in your remarks that there wasnt any share repurchases completed in the fourth quarter maybe chris or don whats the outlook for stock buybacks i may have missed your comment that you gave it but whats the outlook for stock repurchases in christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp gerard were not assuming that theres going to be any meaningful stock repurchases as we look at our balance sheet and supporting our clients and we look at our second priority which is paying our dividend i just dont see us out there repurchasing a lot of shares based on our current modeling gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then you talked a lot about what went on with the deposit betas and the mix of deposits in the quarter obviously your peers had similar comments and the difference that we saw with key was that the margin was essentially flat where others went up how much of the borrowings i noticed in your average balance sheet that you included in the press release your shortterm borrowings and longterm borrowings have gone up and they are much more expensive of course than deposit funding can you share with us your thinking on how youre using those and why they have been going up donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp gerard as far as the funding what weve seen is that the loan growth throughout the second half of the year especially exceeded deposit growth and so we were using fhlb and some other issuances to help address the funding needs i would say that our loan growth outlook and our deposit outlook wouldnt suggest a continuation at the same pace as far as building that other funding sources and so we wouldnt expect to see that same type of a growth rate going forward but near term we work fine with that i would say traditionally we would look at a loan to deposit ratio in the to range and were still below that and so weve got plenty of capacity to continue to leverage that funding source as needed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and don good luck on your future endeavors thank you donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp thanks gerard appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everybody thank you for taking the call don with regard to the billion of nii repricing benefits to which you guys alluded i was wondering if you could just sort of walk through the trajectory of when and how those kick in i mean i see the repricing numbers in the appendix which is very helpful but just would be curious to hear kind of more vocally how you think about it keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 maybe put it another way or i wonder if there is an easy frame of reference what would first quarter nii look like versus say fourth quarter or first quarter im not looking for specific numbers but is there an easy way to say hey we sort of troughed here and then start to accelerate meaningfully off of here and if theres a timeframe around that something like that donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp good and i will offer up a couple of quick comments but turn it over to clark because clark could be the one thats here to deal with that going forward and i wont be around so well go ahead and pass the baton from that perspective one thing i want to highlight though scott is that we take a look for example you mentioned the first quarter of keep in mind there are some things that impact the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter that are more seasonal day count related issues cost about million from where the fourth quarter is to the first quarter we also typically see fee income drop from the fourth quarter to first quarter given some of the refinance activity on the loan side and so we would see the first quarter traditionally being the low point for both our net interest income and net interest margin and wed expect to see growth from there and clark has been spending a lot of time taking a look at strategies as far as the swaps and treasury so clark why dont you take it from there as far as other insights clark h i khayat a chief strategy officer executive vice president keycorp sure just to try to address your question directly scott i think really the majority of the value is going to come in if you think about whats coming off in swaps and treasuries in that number is about billion to billion its more like billion and billion so think about that kind of twothirds onethird almost ratio id say of the number weve shared which is again just to remind you kind of taking all billion of swaps and billion of treasuries and spot pricing them again i think youd see about a third of that benefit in the exit run rate so the beginnings of some steepness in that nim and then more of that pulling through with as youd see again the majority of that maybe twothirds or three quarters of that value started to come through by the end of r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and i guess out of curiosity im a little surprised at how well the estimate kind of held in billion versus i think youre saying billion last quarter just given all that changes in the way the curve has behaved what does it take to really move that number one way or another is that the sort of a billion plus kind of a pretty sturdy number almost regardless of the way things behave clark h i khayat a chief strategy officer executive vice president keycorp yeah id say the biggest impact there is the movement in the twoyear end of the curve and what we saw was the longer end rates moved a lot more significantly than to your point keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you all very much and don best wishes donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp thanks so much operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp hey good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey you guys see financing to wholesale companies from both the lending side and the capital market side and one topic during this earnings season is the capital market conditions are a lot tougher whereas the lending conditions are not that much tougher so when do you think this will converge in other words the pricing in cap market is much more difficult than the pricing in the lending markets are you seeing any firming up or not christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp so the answer is mike it depends and when i say it depends it depends on kind of what the customer strata is so of our loans are to investment grade customers and the adjustments there are immediate there is a bunch of different inputs where the people are hedging putting a swap on there is multiple people looking at it etcetera where there is a disconnect and i dont really think the disconnect goes away is in those kind of quality middle market companies that one bank or one fund can finance and i dont think weve seen not i dont think we havent seen the adjustment there that you would expect mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and do you expect that to change coming up and just your general outlook on capital markets that a nice tailwind at times recently its been a headwind christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so i think look ultimately things get repriced and it takes time whether youre talking about bank debt going into the middle market or youre talking about people doing major strategic acquisitions my experience is it takes keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 literally over a year for people to kind of readjust their expectations and so were obviously easily six months into this but i think the first half in capital markets is going to be challenging because people still remember what the business or the financing was worth say six or eight or nine months ago but eventually and by the way anyone thats a buyer is acutely aware of how things have been repriced but those will converge and i think its going to be i think itll be challenging in the first half of the year mike and i think this big pentup backlog will start to kind of as people go through price discovery will start to clear out in the second half of the year mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp thank you mike operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning and don best of wishes as well from me i just have to come back and just super clarify don the beta for cumulative that is interestbearing that compares to the through three quarters donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp absolutely yes ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay cool and then so just i guess the comparison question that i think continues to come up is just that many peers are talking mid even low in some of the calls that weve heard so far so can you just kind of go one step deeper into the type of pricing assumptions and i guess within products and businesses that just gives you that much better relative confidence to peers thanks clark h i khayat a chief strategy officer executive vice president keycorp sure ken its clark so ill pick that up again for us what we saw in the fourth quarter and what were looking at in is much less about new to key deposits where those kind of new business rates are much higher and necessarily have to be higher to bring them in versus motion in the book of noninterestbearing to interestbearing or from different account to different account where we can manage that transition a little more comfortably and given that what we are avoiding we think in large parts is the significant marginal cost of funds that the new price or new offer dollar requires in repricing the larger book donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 the only other thing i would add ken is that right now were at cumulative i think most of our peers are close to and so by them going to is the same thing as us going to high so the incremental change from this point forward is probably fairly consistent its just that were at a better starting point from peers ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah that makes sense it does seem like though to get to that point your incremental interestbearing deposits costs have to be the betas have to be lower than the in the fourth quarter just square to that donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp as far as the cumulative probably not because you only got a 50basis point increase going forward as far as the rates in but we can go back and reverse engineer the math but i think it still lines up ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay then just one quick one laurel road origination outlook can you give us your updated thoughts there thanks guys christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure ken so laurel road obviously from a straight origination outlook perspective has been challenged its been challenged really by three things one is the federal loan student payment holiday thats a challenge i think thats been extended several times the next is just the rising interest rates which are a challenge and the third challenge that we have there is all the discussion around student loan debt forgiveness obviously i think has some borrowers wanting to stay on the side lines to preserve optionality having said all of that i was impressed that we were able to originate last year billion of refinance loans but even a bigger picture ken is we are trying to create a national digital affinity bank so first of all those originations will come back and they will come back when there is clarity around all the issues i just talked about and there is a bunch of raw material being priced right now that youll be able to refinance advantageously but in the meantime what weve done is build this national digital affinity bank that has a full suite of products for doctors a whole suite of products for nurses were getting a crosssell on the business that we do so there is no question that originations have been challenged and theyll continue to be challenged in the very near term but what were trying to do there is a lot broader this gradfin business that we bought is really interesting because theyre the leader in public service loan forgiveness and where youre going to see a lot of discussion going forward is around this income based repayments and were kind of uniquely qualified to be in there advising on that anytime we advise people obviously were indiscernible them on as full customers so does that answer your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah it does thank you chris keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure ken operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning sorry if i missed it but what part of the yield curve are we more concerned about as we think about your fixed rate assets lowering and i realized it might be a variety of kind of products from the shortterm from the longer term but as we think about it i think that billion you said what part of the yield curve should we watch with obviously longer rates coming in but shorter rates staying high donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp yeah matt as far as the billion its really at two to threeyear end of the curve and thats where we would be looking to extend those swaps when were in a position to do that and so it is in that portion of the yield curve beyond that we also have a little over billion a quarter and rollover our bond portfolio and then we tend to look at some of them around the fiveyear end of the curve there and we tend to do more cmo structures and shorter passthrough like 15year type passthrough assets as far as our normal investment strategy there matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay all right perfect thank you donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter from da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst da davidson co good morning christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp good morning peter j winter q analyst da davidson co chris i heard the comments on the capital markets in the second half of the year i was just wondering if you could give some more color about the moving parts to the fee income in for being down to keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp sure so theres a few areas where we would get pickup and theres a few areas where got some headwind the areas where we will get pickup is in our investment banking area we will get some pickup in cards and payments we will get some pickup in trust don you want to cover the other puts and takes donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp sure the largest decline for us will be in the deposit service charges category we mentioned that this quarter was the first quarter of the implementation of the nsfod fee theres about another million impact in compared to for that and our outlook right now also would suggest that we think that our corporate services income will be down yearoveryear just because weve had such a strong program this year as far as derivatives interest rate swaps and what have you for customers and we think that with less rate volatility there will be less opportunity there for that category thats the blended impact as to how we get to that down to peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it and then the loan to deposit ratio is now at is there a certain level that you dont want to go above and secondly im assuming that youre going to continue to let securities cash flows and use those to kind of help support loan growth donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp we typically would target between and its been a long time since we have been up to that level but thats where we think our balance sheet is still very efficient and access to the capital markets for that national funding sources is available and supports that as the second part of the question i apologize peter remind me peter j winter q analyst da davidson co sure just using securities cash flow donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp i apologize yes what weve talked about a lot is that we got that billion of shortterm treasuries that start to mature later in and throughout that can be a very good source of liquidity for us and were really indifferent whether that replaces funding or whether we roll that over into new securities but if you look at the rest of the portfolio its about billion and we think thats a good core size we can let runoff their fund some of the liquidity needs on a shortterm basis but longer term we think that thats probably a good relative size for the portfolio given our overall liquidity management position peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 christopher m gorman a chairman president chief executive officer keycorp peter the other thing i would add to that as you think about the puts and takes on the balance sheet is that in the fourth quarter for example we put of the capital that we raised which was billion on our balance sheet historically that number has been so with the dislocation in all the capital markets were able to structure things in a manner that we want and put them on our balance sheet as these capital markets work their way out that wont it will basically start deviating back to kind of 18typepercent as opposed to thats just a little bit of a different wrinkle that i think is pretty as i said shortterm over the next half year or so peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thanks and don best of luck and its been a pleasure working with you over these years donald r kimble a chief financial administrative officer keycorp right back at you peter thanks so much
