am now moving to slide three i will provide some overview comments on the quarter and full year results and then don will provide a more detailed look at our results and outlook and then chris will discuss keys priorities for and beyond as youve seen with our headlines this morning key had a good quarter which finishes what has been another successful year for our company as we continue to grow invest for the future and deliver on our commitments for the fourth quarter we reported gaap earnings per share of and our eps results for the quarter were excluding from notable items related to a previously disclosed fraud loss and a pension settlement charge to provide a consistent view of our financial trends and prior period comparisons my remarks this morning will focus on results that exclude notable items in all periods keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 importantly we delivered positive operating leverage for both the quarter and the year and this was our seventh consecutive year of positive operating leverage which places us among a select group of peers we continue to see strong balance sheet growth this quarter with both loans and deposits up over relative to the yearago period our relationshipbased business model continues to position us well with our targeted clients which results in more clients and expanded relationships total revenue was up linkedquarter but down slightly for the year reflecting the impact of lower interest rates don will discuss our revenue outlook in his remarks but we believe we are well positioned for the rate environment and have opportunities to grow both our spread income and fee revenue expense management has been a real bright spot this year fullyear expenses are down from the prior year as we completed our million cost reduction program and drove further savings through our continuous improvement efforts this helped improve our cash efficiency ratio by basis points yearoveryear and although we have been focused on reducing expenses we have continued to invest a portion of our cost savings back in the business to drive future growth and let me touch briefly on two of those investments laurel road and our residential mortgage business we acquired laurel road in april of last year and our loan originations during the year totaled billion well above our original expectations and these are highquality loans largely focused on medical professionals that provide us an opportunity to build broader digital relationships with these clients over time our residential mortgage business is another area where were seeing strong return on our investments originations for were billion up over from with billion being originated this last quarter we are seeing record activity and pipelines are poised for continued growth into now turning to credit quality our trends remained solid this quarter with net chargeoff of basis points for the year excluding the fraud loss which remains below our longterm overthecycle range our nonperforming loans declined slightly from the prior quarter and our other credit metrics including criticized and classified loans remained relatively stable we believe that our steadfast commitment to maintaining our moderate risk profile and strong credit underwriting will continue to serve us well and we have continued to maintain a strong capital position while returning a significant amount of our capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter we repurchased million of common shares and declared an quarterly dividend up from last year and before i turn the call over to don let me just say again that this was a good quarter for key and clearly demonstrates the strength and resiliency of our business model across the company we continued to add and expand relationships which drove growth in loans deposits and fees our business model and interest rate hedging also position us well as we move through different business cycles and rate environments and expense management remains a priority as we continue to identify opportunities to improve efficiency and finally our ceo transition continues to proceed smoothly with chris assuming the ceo role may im confident in chris and the leadership team are fully engaged and committed to deliver on our longterm targets maintain our moderate risk profile and ultimately deliver value for our shareholders and our results and our bright future would not be possible without our talented and diverse team across our company i want to thank all of them and share with you how proud i am of the entire key team with that ill close and turn the call over to don keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 donald r kimble vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thanks beth im now on slide this morning we reported fourth quarter net income from continuing operations of per common share adjusting for notable items including a pension settlement charge and additional costs related to a previously disclosed fraud loss in july of earnings per share was our adjusted results compared to per share in both the yearago period and the prior quarter this quarter we recognized an additional charge of million in our provision related to the previously disclosed fraud incident importantly we do not expect material losses from this incident in future periods i would also point out that no collections have been applied against our loss but we do expect recoveries to be realized later this year ill cover many of the remaining items on this slide in the rest of my presentation so now turning to slide total average loans are billion up from the fourth quarter of last year driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans consumer loans benefited from strong growth from laurel road our residential mortgage business and indirect auto laurel road originated over million of student loan consolidation loans this quarter and we generated billion of residential mortgage loans the investments we have made in these areas are clearly driving results and importantly adding highquality loans to our portfolio linkedquarter average loan balances were up and were primarily driven by momentum in our consumer business ci loans in the fourth quarter were relatively flat reflecting the timing of various bridge loan repayments which are consistent with our business model importantly we have remained disciplined with our credit underwriting and we have walked away from business that does not meet our moderate risk profile we remain committed to performing well through the business cycle and we manage our credit quality with this longerterm perspective continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the fourth quarter up billion or compared to the yearago period and up from the prior quarter growth from the prior year and prior quarter was driven by both consumer and commercial clients as well as additional shortterm deposits in our current quarter total interestbearing deposit costs came down basis points from the prior quarter reflecting the impact of lower interest rates and the associated lag in pricing we would expect deposit costs to continue to decline further throughout we continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for of our deposit mix turning to slide taxableequivalent net interest income was million for the fourth quarter of compared to just over billion in the fourth quarter of million in the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the fourth quarter of compared with in the fourth quarter of and for the third quarter the decrease in net interest income from the fourth quarter reflects lower interest rates and higher interestbearing deposit costs as well as a decline in purchase accounting accretion these declines were partially offset by higher earning asset balances compared to the third quarter net interest income increased million or driven by an increase in average earning assets and a relatively stable net interest margin our net interest margin this quarter reflects both lower earning asset yields and the benefit from lower deposit costs with our interestbearing deposit costs down basis points from the prior quarter keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 in the appendix of our slide deck you can find additional information on our assetliability positioning weve continued to actively hedge to reduce our exposure to declining rates executing approximately billion in interest rate swaps and floors in the fourth quarter since the third quarter of we have entered into total swaps and floors of billion today our net interest income impact for basis point parallel decrease from the current levels is approximately moving on to slide keys noninterest income was million for the fourth quarter compared to million for the yearago quarter and million in the third quarter the increase from the yearago period reflects higher operating lease income consumer mortgage fees and corporate services income other income this quarter reflected a million reduction related to the marketrelated credit valuation adjustments tied to customer derivatives this reduction was partially offset by various gains compared to the prior quarter noninterest income was relatively stable a seasonal increase in corporateowned life insurance and a solid finish to the year in investment banking business was largely offset by the decline in other income our investment banking revenues came in slightly below our expectations as certain transactions were delayed into the first quarter of setting up a strong pipeline going into this year im now turning to slide expense management continued to be a very positive story as weve delivered on our expense and efficiency commitments fourth quarter reported noninterest expense was million which included million of notable items an million pension settlement charge recorded in other expense and million of professional fees related to the previously reported fraud loss the yearago period also included notable items totaling million related to a pension settlement charge and efficiencyrelated costs no notable items were reported in the third quarter adjusting for notable items compared with the yearago period noninterest expense declined million reflecting the successful implementation of keys expense initiatives across the franchise partially offset by the addition of laurel road in april compared to the prior quarter adjusting for notable items noninterest expense increased million business services and professional fees were seasonally higher this quarter and we had an increase in incentive compensation in part attributed to the quarterly increase in our stock price increasing our stockbased compensation by million these increases were partially offset by lower intangible amortization moving on to slide our credit quality remains strong and we continue to be consistent and disciplined in our underwriting as i said earlier our provision in net chargeoffs this quarter included million from a previously disclosed fraud loss the charge was a result of payrollrelated payments for employees of clients of the fraudulent company again we do not expect any further material losses related to the previously disclosed fraud event to be recognized in future periods and we do expect recoveries to be realized later this year excluding the fraud loss net chargeoffs were million or basis points of the average total loans in the fourth quarter which continued to be below our overthecycle range of basis points to basis points on a similar basis again excluding the fraud loss the provision for credit losses was million for the quarter which exceeded net chargeoffs reflecting continued loan growth nonperforming loans were million this quarter down million from the prior quarter nonperforming loans represent basis points of periodend loans compared to basis points last quarter criticized loans also declined this quarter overall credit quality remains strong our new loan originations in both our commercial and consumer books continue to be of highquality in relationship businesses keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 turning to slide capital ratios remained relatively stable this quarter with a common equity tier ratio of at the end of the fourth quarter as beth mentioned earlier we remain committed to our capital priorities including returning a significant amount to our shareholders in the fourth quarter we declared a common dividend of per share we also continued to repurchase common shares with million repurchased this quarter on slide we have provided our outlook for the full year this builds on our performance in and reflects our expectation for another year of positive operating leverage and continued momentum across the company guidance range definitions are provided at the bottom of the slide average loans should be up in the midsingledigit range driven by growth in both commercial and consumer balances well continue to benefit from our distinctive commercial platform and the recent investments weve made in our consumer businesses including laurel road and our consumer mortgage business average deposits should be up in the lowsingledigit range net interest income should be up in the low single digits this assumes solid balance sheet growth lower deposit rates and continued benefit from our assetliability positioning noninterest income should be up midsingle digits reflecting growth in most of our core feebased businesses we would expect to hold noninterest expense relatively stable in excluding notable items reflecting our culture of continuous improvement and our focus on efficiency while allowing us to continue to make investments for future growth using the midpoints of our revenue and expense guidance ranges for this would result in our eighth consecutive year of positive operating leverage placing us in a select group of our peers for our cash efficiency ratio it would show continued progress that would place us just slightly above our targeted range of to for the year our efficiency outlook reflects the meaningful decline we have seen in both shortterm rates as well as the long end of the curve what has not changed is our focus on expenses and as i said we expect to hold expenses relatively stable which includes additional cost savings that will allow us to invest back in our business moving to credit quality we see nothing on the horizon that changes our outlook net chargeoffs to average loans should remain relatively stable with the second half of and below our throughthecycle targeted range of basis points to basis points and we expect our loanloss provision will exceed net chargeoffs reflecting continued loan growth the adoption of cecl will impact will result in an increase to our provision for loan growth our assumption is the economy is relatively stable throughout the year not requiring any further adjustments to the ending allowance our guidance for our gaap tax rate would be in the range of to and one more item not included in our guidance is our share count from to our average shares declined by million shares the decline would be slightly less for given the higher share price and the impact of our capital plan our guidance also assumes some variability over the course of the year first quarter will reflect normal seasonality including a lower day count and an increase in personnel expense driven by heightened employee benefit costs and finally well remain confident in our ability to achieve our longterm targets listed at the bottom of the slide which we believe will translate into greater shareholder value before i turn the call back over to the operator chris will provide some comments on our results this morning and our outlook and priorities chris christopher m gorman president chief operating officer director keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 thank you don i would agree with beth and don that this was a good quarter and a very successful for key this is especially notable given the challenging rate environment our performance clearly demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our strategy and our business model importantly we continued to make investments to drive longterm growth sometimes at the expense of nearterm earnings and efficiency a great example is laurel road not only has this acquisition exceeded our initial expectations but we believe we have only begun to realize the potential of laurel road in building longterm digital relationships its a great example of strengthening our franchise by building scale in a very targeted way as we look forward our priorities will guide our decision making in and beyond first we will continue to invest in order to build targeted scale in our distinctive and proven business model technology in digitizing our business will remain high on our list of priorities secondly we will continue on our journey to improve productivity and efficiency which will drive positive operating leverage third there is nothing more important than maintaining our moderate risk profile this is an area where we underperformed through the last downturn and we are committed to outperform through the next business cycle and finally we will be disciplined with our capital as youve probably heard me say we are focused on the return on and the return of capital i will close by saying that im very excited about keys future as beth mentioned our leadership transition continues to go very smoothly we have a great leadership team and we are well positioned to achieve our long term targets we believe our valuation does not yet reflect the strength of our company and the progress that we have made i am committed to delivering on our commitments and building value for our shareholders with that let me turn the call over to the operator for instructions for the qa portion of the call operator keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and well go to gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone how are you donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp good morning beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer and director keycorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc beth can you share with us or maybe chris as well what are you hearing from your business customers weve heard some of your peers talk about a change of sentiment amongst commercial customers in the fourth quarter and i was wondering if you guys saw any of that in your fourth quarter numbers beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer and director keycorp yes i will briefly address that and then ill turn it over to chris to further augment but i do think as we go back and look at the summer when there was so much anxiety for lack of a better term in the economy and sentiment was impacted by what were going to be various trends around trade interest rates global growth we saw a strengthening of sentiment in the fourth quarter as a number of these things both got clarified specifically relative around trade and then just the impact of the cumulative months of the economy continuing to perform well so sentiment strengthened as we went through the end of the year and obviously consumer sentiment with the strength of the employment and labor markets ended the year strong as well chris christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp yes beth the only thing i would add to that the consumer is very strong and we see that in our mortgage business we see that in our laurel road business as we look at fico scores very solid on the consumer side on the commercial side gerard to your point and beths point we did see what i think is a pivot to more constructive kind of mindset and discussions in the last to days the challenges still remain in that area were not seeing a lot of capital investment yet i would anticipate that we would at some point and also the biggest challenge is continuing to be able to go out and hire people those are kind of the two challenges but i do agree with the premise of your question that its gotten better as we got through brexit and also some trade discussions keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very well and then don you touched a couple times in your prepared remarks about the losses associated with the fraud twopart question one is in the postop now its about six months from that discovery what have you guys learned from that issue and then second you talked about recoveries i dont know if you can give us a guide on how much you think you might recover donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp yes a couple of things what we have learned and maybe id provide a little bit of additional clarity as to what happened as far as losses this quarter that we have made the decision as we entered into this discovery that we were going to honor payments or going to employees or employee benefits related to employees of customers of the fraudulent company and so we went ahead and made sure we had good money for good people and so we had some outsized payments occur after that july time period that got reflected in this additional million charge this quarter and so we think its the right decision for us as a company that did translate to that we do not expect to see any further material charges going forward from this and continue to work with the bankruptcy courts the restructuring agent thats on site and also the forensic accountants as well and as far as the recoveries going forward were still subjected to the legal process so we are not in a position yet to start to realize some of the benefits for those recoveries but as i highlighted briefly that we do believe that the loss we recognized this quarter is temporary and that future recoveries should more than offset that but we probably dont expect much until second half of this year as far as a flow from that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thank you operator our next question is from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning hey don you mentioned in your comments you had a bit of the excess liquidity and you mentioned your lingering exposure rate changes im just wondering as youre growing the consumer book and fixed rate product at it how do you expect that liquidity to get pull out back into earning assets and do you expect to grow the securities book anymore or is that a reasonable size thanks donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp yeah i would say that we would expect as we highlighted to see a midsingledigit kind of loan growth and its going to have a better contribution from consumer loan growth and so were very excited about that weve also highlighted that we expect to see deposits up low single digits and so youll start to see a remixing of the overall balance sheet keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 long term we target our loantodeposit ratio to be in the to range and were well south of that today so weve got a lot of room to move that liquidity position down and remix into more loans and so thats why we feel comfortable with our guidance as far as relatively stable margin and could have some potential upside if that liquidity level gets absorbed quicker than what our forecasts would suggest ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then one question on the efficiency ratio you mentioned that you expect to be a little bit above the top end of the million million if rates stay flat from here what would need to happen to get back inside that range on an annual basis donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp what we talked about was that with our midpoint of our guidance ranges that weve established it does show positive operating leverage and with that positive operating leverage operating leverage i can say that very well with that positive operating leverage it will help drive that efficiency ratio down and so thats part of our guidance and so we do think that well make progress towards that in and thats whats needed to continue to achieve that from here that if you would just look at the rate environment that was in place in october of when we initially set this goal and also when we reaffirmed in january of last year were seeing a bigger impact as far as rates on our net interest income and if we would have had that rate environment in place throughout the year we would have been inside that range here in the fourth quarter and also our outlook for would be inside that range so thats really the sole contributor that we are achieving our expense targets and we are making progress as far as growing the overall core business but realizing the nearterm impact of the lower rate environment ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thank you don donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thank you operator next well go to scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question don just a quick question you mentioned earlier and it stands to reason most of or i guess the preponderance of growth will come continue to come from the consumer side just as you guys look at things at what point would we anticipate seeing a heavier lift on the provision just due to the complexion of growth donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 yeah well this year will be an interesting year for all banks because of cecl and i would say that the provision for loan growth should be higher on a relative basis compared to what was in the incurred loss method and thats because the reserves required are higher that being said the categories that were expecting to continue to grow are very high fico scores so whether its residential mortgage or the laurel road loans or even our indirect auto even the cecl reserves are not that significant and so we think that there will be some pressure there but not as much as you might initially assume christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp scott its chris the only thing i would add to that is our starting point obviously weve been working really hard to be a more balanced bank between commercial and consumer and our starting point is such that we think those are asset classes we can really grow r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes okay perfect thank you and then maybe chris if you could just give kind of an updated thought on the outlook for the investment banking business i know don had mentioned that a couple deals might have gotten pushed into the first quarter from the fourth quarter so presumably the pipeline is pretty strong but just your overall thoughts on how might play out christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp yes we feel good about where that business is as don mentioned in his comments we did have some slippage from things into the fourth quarter into the first quarter but obviously the tradeoff for that is we go into the first quarter with strong pipelines we feel good about the business scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you guys very much donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thank you operator our next question is from peter winter with wedbush securities please go ahead peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp good morning keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer and director keycorp good morning peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i wanted to ask about the fee income it was flat in and what some of the drivers are to get to the mid singledigit growth rate for donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp yes sure a couple things there one in as you recall in the first quarter of we had a government shutdown which really impacted on a negative way the investment banking debt placement fees we only had million in that quarter up until that the first quarter tend to run around millionorso in ibd revenues and so that was a direct impact also linked year that in we sold off our insurance business which also had about a million drag as far as the yearoveryear fee income growth and so that also had a negative impact from that perspective going forward we think that the fee income well see some strong growth from investment banking debt placement fees not only because of the pipeline but because we have an outlook that doesnt include a government shutdown and so we think first quarter should be off to a good start on a relative basis we also expect to see continued growth in residential mortgage fees weve seen some very good growth this year we had billion in originations and thats more than double what it was a year ago and so we expect to see continued trajectory there as far as growing that business and the third category which had some noise in it in as well was our cards and paymentsrelated revenues that we launched a new cashback card which had some negative impacts as far as the first year startup of that product along with the wind down of a previous joint venture we had there and so our expectation for would show growth in that category as opposed to a relatively stable level there as well so were excited about the momentum in our feebased businesses and thats why we show an outlook that has midsingledigit kind of growth for the year peter winter a analyst wedbush securities inc thanks very helpful and then chris if i can ask about laurel road obviously the origination activity is much better than even you guys were expecting can you talk about some of the opportunities that you have to deepen those relationships on the digital side and when we would start to see some type of impact christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp sure so theres kind of three phases to it one is to make sure were doing a really good job in the student loan refinance business and obviously thats hitting on all cylinders so thats working the next phase is the notion of mortgages and so we are in the pilot process and well be rolling out throughout the opportunity for people complete online experience to go out and get a mortgage the nice thing about that peter is were also going to were going to actually transport that across key so that will have a benefit for the rest of our company and then lastly were in the very early stages of this but we believe as i mentioned in my remarks keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 that we have the opportunity to realize holistic digital relationships with these more than a million healthcare professionals that are out there as an available market peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great if i could just squeeze in one more housekeeping how much was the paydowns on the commercial side from the bridge loans this quarter donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp total paydowns for bridge loans were approximately billion this quarter so they were outsized compared to normal levels but as we highlighted thats part of our core ongoing business and so we will expect some timing differences throughout the various periods as to those events occurring peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator operator instructions and now next we go to the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp good morning beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer and director keycorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on the efficiency ratio expectation the to i understand that you expect to be just above it for can you talk about the attainability of that range in terms of timing if we dont get rates i know you answered to ken that you had originally expected a better rate environment than what weve seen so if we assume that we dont get any change on the rate front what is the timing around that range whats the reality about when you really see that as achievable donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp john are you talking about for the full year or by quarters because we dont provide quarterly guidance i would say that we would expect to see ongoing improvement this year compared to and further improvement in keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 that if you use the midpoint of the guidance range we still have a handle to that efficiency ratio number and so i think were making sizable progress toward that and we continue to focus on that generation of the positive operating leverage to drive the earnings level so i think were good there john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay all right thanks and then separately on the cecl front could you just talk about how cecl may have impacted your appetite to grow on the consumer side is there any difference in how youre going to be treating some of the exposure that you put on the books in terms of longerdated consumer loans thanks donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp yeah sure we continue to look at that i would say that the good thing about the consumer loan products that were focused on and were focused on very high fico scores and so very low default factors associated with those customers and through any type of economic scenario and so we do believe that it still is appropriate risk profile for us so really hasnt impacted our origination strategy that it does have a little bit higher upfront cost when you book the loan compared to the incurred loss method but economically we still feel that its the right move and excited about the returns and the growth that were seeing from those areas john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thanks if i could just ask one more on the margin side i know you had indicated that you do expect some incremental declines in deposit costs so for the margin outlook of relatively stable versus the fourth quarter level so does that imply that you expect some decline on the loan yield side or is it a mixed factor that can help keep the or that will not or do you see some form of earning asset decline there in yields donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp yes we could see some slight resetting of the loan yields some of the fixed rate loans the current goto rates are slightly below what the portfolio is so we should see some migration there in the investment portfolio that overall rate came down by about basis points this quarter and that well see some continued slight pressure there that our current purchase yield is slightly below where the overall portfolio is and so that will put some pressure but with all that considered we do expect to see the margin relatively stable and deposit costs should come down to help offset that other pressure john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks don donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thank you operator our next question is from erika najarian with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp good morning beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer and director keycorp good morning erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i wanted to follow up on kens question the markets feeling good about some sort of revenue stability and growth going forward but if the revenue outlook disappoints particularly if it falls outside of your range is there room to take expenses down in order to generate positive operating leverage or does the stable expense outlook have pretty firm plans in place for donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp well a couple things one weve always talked about it if the growth prospects from an organic business perspective arent there we cant pull that lever to pull back on the investments to pull or reduce the expenses over time and so part of the challenge is that we dont have that same flexibility if some of those are raterelated like we experienced in but we do have levers there and then the second thing is that those revenues that were forecasting growth rates to many of them have some variable expense component to it and so if the revenues arent delivered we wont see the increase in incentive compensation that were forecasting in other areas like that and chris any other thoughts there christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp well the only thing i would add to that erika is we have a lot of plans that involve investment and so as we look at this plan to the extent that the revenues dont show up as we would anticipate we have the opportunity to either defer investment or reevaluate investments so we are committed to providing positive operating leverage and well pull the levers that we need to erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch great and just as a followup question to johns line of questioning earlier how much more room do you think there is to lower deposit costs from here donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp yes i would say near term even in a stable rate environment for the next few quarters we could see a to basis point kind of linkedquarter decline in deposit rates and some of that is related to what we talked about last keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 quarter that we have some promotional rate money market deposits that will reset after either a 6month window or a 12month window and thats about billion and as those reset that will help provide some benefit as far as driving those deposit costs down erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you donald r kimble a vice chairman chief financial officer keycorp thank you operator and with no further questions ms mooney ill turn it back to you if you have any closing comments beth elaine mooney chairman chief executive officer and director keycorp again we thank you for participating in our call today and if
