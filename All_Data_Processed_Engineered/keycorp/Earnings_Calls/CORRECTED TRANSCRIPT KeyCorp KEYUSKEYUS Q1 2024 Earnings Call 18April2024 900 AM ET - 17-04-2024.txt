questionandanswer session operator instructions as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to brian mauney keycorps director of investor relations please go ahead brian mauney directorinvestor relations keycorp thank you operator and good morning everyone id like to thank you for joining keycorps first quarter earnings conference call i am here with chris gorman our chairman and chief executive officer and clark khayat our chief financial officer as usual we will reference our earnings presentation slides which can be found in the investor relations section of the keycom website in the back of the presentation you will find our statement on forwardlooking disclosures and certain financial measures including nongaap measures this covers our earnings materials as well as remarks made on this mornings call actual results may differ materially from forwardlooking statements and those statements speak only as of today april and will not be updated keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 with that i will turn it over to chris christopher m gorman chairman chief executive officer keycorp thank you brian im on slide this morning we reported earnings of million or per share which incorporates per share impact from an additional fdic special assessment charge this quarter i would characterize our underlying results as solid revenue was essentially flat sequentially despite expected first quarter seasonality as investment banking reported its best first quarter result in our companys history fees were up against both the prior quarter and prior year retail relationship households were up yearoveryear and commercial clients were up customer deposits were up yearoveryear and essentially flat on a sequential basis we continued to reduce our reliance on highercost brokered cds and wholesale borrowings expenses remained well controlled at billion nonperforming assets and credit losses remained low additionally we continued to build our credit reserves this quarter our capital ratios including tangible common ratios were flat to improved across the board despite the impact of higher interest rates on the fair value of our availableforsale securities we ended the quarter with a common equity tier ratio of up basis points from a year ago representing our fastest rate of organic capital build over a 12month period since the industry began tracking this metric im also encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in areas where we have a differentiated advantage and have been investing while only one quarter i am encouraged by the strong broadbased results we saw in our capital markets business across ma equity and debt capital markets and our commercial mortgage group we also are seeing broad momentum across our targeted industry verticals such as healthcare power industrials and renewables while i would expect to see some pullback in fees in the second quarter our pipelines are up from a year ago and from yearend levels market conditions are clearly starting to normalize we also continue to raise significant capital on behalf of our clients in the first quarter we raised over billion holding on our balance sheet and distributing the balance in the capital markets to this end last month we announced a strategic forward flow origination partnership with blackstone this partnership will allow us to accelerate growth and manage credit concentration risk within our differentiated commercial platform it is another example of how we are delivering bestinclass execution for our clients this deal also further validates our distinctive underwritetodistribute model in that one of the largest private credit providers has recognized our platform for its ability to originate soundly underwrite and service at volume with our highquality clients as markets evolve we will continue to evaluate the potential for arrangements with other leading providers like this one which allow us to offer a distinctive experience for our clients while concurrently managing our risk turning to wealth management we recently launched key private client where we have the opportunity to penetrate a large growing mass affluent segment within our consumer base and with our commercial business owners in this mass affluent segment we enrolled another households in this quarter and doubled production volumes compared to last year this new business has added over billion of household assets in just over a year overall our assets under management have now surpassed billion keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 before i turn it over to clark i want to touch briefly on credit quality as i mentioned earlier our nonperforming loans net credit losses and delinquencies remain at low historical standards with credit losses below our fullyear and throughthecycle targets in the first quarter we saw an uptick in criticized loans which was driven by our belief which by the way we have held for some time now that we will remain in a higherforlonger environment as inflation remains sticky with that in mind this quarter we performed a deep dive on over of our clients that we believe would be most impacted under a higherforlonger scenario encompassing over of our noninvestmentgrade commercial exposures performing this deep dive confirmed our view that there will be low loss content in these loans approximately of accruing criticized commercial loans are current and are current when also including nonaccruing loans over of our criticized real estate loans have recourse i continue to feel very good about our ability to hit our net chargeoff guidance of to basis points this year in summary while its still early in the year we are on pace to deliver against the commitments that we detailed at the beginning of this year key is back to playing offense and i remain excited about our future and our ability to generate sound profitable growth moving forward i also want to take a moment to thank our teammates for their continued commitment to our clients and our communities i am very proud to share with you that for the 11th consecutive exam cycle since the passage of the regulation in key received an outstanding rating from the occ for meeting or exceeding the terms of the community reinvestment act this achievement reflects our collective commitment to our purpose and an enormous amount of hard work and dedication from every teammate at key with that ill turn it over to clark to provide more details on the results of the quarter clark clark h i khayat chief financial officer keycorp thanks chris and thank you everyone for joining us today im now on slide for the first quarter we reported earnings per share of including impact from the fdic special assessment this quarters million pretax assessment represented a addon to the charge we had taken in the fourth quarter relating to the bank failures last spring as expected our taxableequivalent net interest income declined sequentially within the range of down to that we provided in january noninterest income increased compared to both the prior year and quarter primarily driven by strong investment banking performance reported expenses were down and excluding selected items expenses were up slightly linked quarter and essentially flat yearoveryear at approximately billion provision for credit losses of million was roughly flat to the fourth quarter and included million of net loan chargeoffs and million of credit reserve build our common equity tier ratio increased to while tangible book value declined sequentially reflecting the impact of higher rates on aoci this quarter moving to the balance sheet on slide average loans declined sequentially to billion and loans ended the quarter at about billion down approximately billion from yearend the decline reflects the expected followon impact of intentional actions we took in to reduce lowreturn lendingonly ci relationships and the runoff of residential mortgages and student loans as they pay down and mature keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 lower balances are also a function of lower client demand driven by the uptick in rates in the quarter and the return of capital markets activity which moves some client assets to more attractive offbalance sheet structures we also remain disciplined and intentional about what were putting on our balance sheet were very active with clients and prospects and still expect new loan origination to come back throughout on slide average deposits declined about sequentially in line with recent historical seasonal patterns and within that decline we reduced brokered deposits by roughly billion client deposits were up year overyear both total and interestbearing cost of deposits rose by basis points during the quarter primarily reflecting repricing of existing cds and money market deposits as they come up for maturity and some continued migration out of noninterestbearing when adjusted for the noninterestbearing deposits in our hybrid commercial accounts our percentage of noninterestbearing to total deposits dropped from to linked quarter our cumulative interestbearing deposit beta was just below since the fed began raising interest rates up about percentage points from last quarter on the bottom left of the page weve split out for you our deposit mix by product type and for interestbearing by business including how much of our commercial book is indexed or managed to benchmark rates we hope youll find this information useful as you think through potential beta sensitivities moving to net interest income and margin on slide taxableequivalent net interest income was million down from the prior quarter approximately million of benefit from fixed rate asset repricing mostly from swaps and shortdated us treasuries was more than offset by lower loan volumes higher deposit costs and deposit mix migration day count impact was about million net interest margin declined by basis points to driven by higher deposit costs lowerthanexpected loans and changes in funding mix both our net interest income and margin continue to reflect headwinds from prior balance sheet positioning our shortdated swaps in us treasuries reduced net interest income by million and our nim by about basis points this quarter that said we affirm our prior commitments that our nim bottomed in and that this first quarter of reflects the low point for net interest income turning to slide noninterest income was million up quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear compared to the prior year the increase was primarily driven by investment banking fees which grew to million a record first quarter strong performance was broadbased across products and industries commercial mortgage servicing fees rose yearoveryear reflecting growth in servicing special servicing and active special servicing balances at march we serviced about billion of assets on behalf of third party clients finally trust and investment services grew by yearoveryear as assets under management grew to billion were seeing strong momentum in key private client as well as tailwinds from higher market levels conversely on a yearoveryear basis corporate services income declined by given elevated libor to sofrrelated transaction activity in the first quarter a year ago and the decline in cards and payments fees reflects slowing spend volumes and lower interchange rates in credit card and merchant keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 on slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion and included million related to the fdic special assessment increase excluding selected items in all periods expenses were flat compared to a year ago and up from fourth quarter personnel expenses were flat yearoveryear as a decline in head count offset impact from inflation and merit and higher incentive compensation associated with our strong fee revenue results and the impact of appreciation of our stock price associated with equity awards linked quarter higher personnel costs also reflect seasonal benefits costs in addition to the factors just listed moving to slide credit quality remains solid net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans below our target of to basis points for the fullyear delinquencies increased just basis points this quarter and nonperforming loans increased but remained low at basis points of periodend loans as chris mentioned criticized loans increased and represented of loans at quarterend roughly twothirds of the increase came from our ci portfolio with the rest primarily in commercial real estate our internal ratings are driven by primary repayment sources as loans were moved to criticized we reaffirmed our collateral coverage reappraised properties further engaged with borrowers to understand operating pressures if any and analyzed secondary payment sources on these loans based on that thorough review we feel good about the loss content on these loans and as chris shared remain comfortable with our prior loss guidance for of to basis points on slide given this was a fairly unique quarter in terms of the ins and outs we provided you with a walk of how we derived a roughly million build in our credit allowance this quarter we added roughly million to account for the quarters credit migration partially offset by a million release to account for an improved macro outlook even with this quarters proactive deep dive our net upgrades to downgrades ratio across the entire commercial book improved this quarter as the velocity of downgrades has slowed as a result our allowance for credit losses continued to build and represented of periodend loans at the end of march when you analyze our levels of reserves by loan type youll find that we compare similarly or better versus our peers and we feel particularly well reserved in our commercial real estate including a acl against nonowneroccupied cre loans turning to slide we continue to build our capital position with cet1 of basis points to or basis points above our required minimum including our stress capital buffer our marked cet1 ratio which includes unrealized afs and pension losses increased basis points to and our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio held steady down just basis points at this outcome despite the roughly basis point increase in fiveyear rates during the quarter reflects work we have done over the past year to reduce our exposure to higher rates this includes reducing the size of our securities portfolio reducing the portfolio duration and putting on roughly billion of pay fix swaps while terminating about billion of fixed cash flow swaps last fall weve reduced our ph dd01 by over the past months our aoci was negative billion at quarterend including billion related to afs as weve shared with you in the past the right side of this slide shows keys goforward expected reduction in our aoci mark based on two scenarios the forward curve as of march which assumes six rate cuts through and another scenario where rates hold at march levels through the end of next year keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 in the forward curve scenario the aoc sic aoci mark is expected to decline by approximately by the end of which would provide approximately billion of capital build through that timeframe in the flat scenario we still accrete billion of capital driven by maturities cash flows and time slide provides our outlook for relative to in short our guidance is unchanged from what we shared in january if theres one commitment we think will be a little more challenging to hit it will be ending loan balances given the impact of rate increases on client demand and our own selectivity of loans but as well show you in a minute we dont believe this will impact our ability to deliver on our net interest income commitments both for the full year and the fourth quarter exit rate on slide we updated the net interest income opportunity from swaps and shortdated treasuries maturing as forward rates have moved higher this quarter this cumulative opportunity has increased to million from the roughly million we estimated last quarter of course some of this incremental benefit will be offset by higher funding cost and a higherforlonger environment as of the end of the first quarter weve realized a little over of this opportunity to date which is shown on the left side of the slide in the gray bars this leaves about million annualized net interest income opportunity left that we expect to capture over the next months moving to slide we wanted to lay out for you the path of how we intend to get from the million of reported net interest income this quarter to a billionplus number by the end of the year in the top block weve laid out the drivers of growth assuming rates generally follow the forward curve and the fed cuts twice later this year once in september and again in december in this scenario we see about million benefit from the swaps in us treasuries in line with what we showed you on the previous slide we also have another roughly billion of projected fixed rate cash flows rolling every quarter currently yielding in the low range that will get reinvested at higher rates this offsets the immediate impact that rate cuts would have on our variable rate loans and other shortterm floating rate investments we see some modest benefit inyear from lower funding costs particularly from our indexed commercial deposits and wholesale funding wed also expect the net interest margin to improve meaningfully to the to range in the fourth quarter with about of the improvement driven by the treasuries and swaps and the other through lower funding costs in the bottom walk we hold rates flat to where they are at march in this scenario we get more earning asset repricing benefit because variable rate loans and other shortterm instruments do not reprice lower that is partially offset by deposit betas continuing to creep a little higher as weve said we expect to support clients and prospects to drive highquality loan growth throughout the year should loan demand remain softer than expected we would still expect to meet our  net interest income guidance in either scenario i just described with that i will now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the qa portion of our call operator keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question is from the line of ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning clark im wondering if you can kind of start where you just finished and just looking at those two scenarios on slide i hear you that it still seems like theres a lot of ways to get to that billionplus just wondering how you can help us understand the variance of those outcomes maybe a way to think about how much those two cuts mean on their own or some of the other kind of moving parts that would change that or is it really just like a pretty narrow answer whatever the cut scenario is in terms of where that fourth quarter exit lands clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah thanks ken and great question i would point you to and just say if you look at the two ends the swap and ust rolloff thats a pretty predictable number we think weve been good about disclosing the details there thats i think pretty straightforward math itll be a little bit better in a nocut than in a cut scenario as you know but its within a bound range when you think about two cuts versus zero and then on the other side the impact from loan growth which again we think is coming but will be a little bit backend loaned has a relatively minimum inyear impact so the range of outcomes on loan growth while wed rather have more inyear i dont think is a huge driver of this number so it really is those two pieces in the middle and the trade between how much more you get from asset repricing net of loan yields if there are cuts versus what the impact of funding is and those sort of work to offset each other a little bit but in a way that we think is relatively muted for the course of the year and then just the other point id make is the million while on the low end for the quarter was within the guide and obviously when we gave you the guide for  we had in mind hitting not only the fullyear guide but importantly the fourth quarter exit rate and we continue to confirm our ability to do that is that helpful ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah it is thank you and as a followup on that loan growth point im just wondering in the prepared remarks chris talked about the new agreement with blackstone and im just wondering that dynamic and how that plays into the combination of loan growth investment banking fees and kind of like what that means for how you originate versus how you distribute christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp well good morning ken so its a good question let me hit the loan growth kind of headon we have always demonstrated an ability to grow loans having said that sort of three things all have to be present for us to grow loans one there has to be demand right now there is not a lot of loan demand out there so thats point one you see it in kind of flat utilization among other things and not a lot of investment keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 the second thing is it has to be in our clients best interest for us to in fact provide those loans and you probably noticed that we raised billion but only put on our balance sheet and thats because we can better serve our clients whether its through the forward flow arrangement with blackstone that you referenced or a variety of other markets and the third thing is that the loans that are available to put on our balance sheet have to fit our risk profile and they have to fit our return requirements right now theres not a lot of loans like that from our perspective having said that whats interesting about bank loans is because theres excess capacity the best time to make bank loans is when theres a downturn and our house view is we are going to see a downturn and that will be a great time for us to really use our balance sheet your question though the implications your question really have are broader than just the loan growth and let me just spend a little bit of time talking about how were positioning key we think that no matter how things play out all banks like key are going to have to carry more capital and as a consequence of that what were focusing on is really serving our clients through capitallight type businesses specifically payments which weve invested in for a long time investment banking which we referenced our wealth business which we think we have an opportunity to really grow and lastly something that we frankly havent capitalized on the degree that we could or should have to date and thats business banking were a really good commercial bank weve never really capitalized on the opportunity in my opinion to gather the deposits thats a business bank is a very depositcentric business so i just wanted to give you some insight of how were thinking about the business model going forward and how we continue to reposition key ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you chris christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure operator thank you and our next question is from john pancari from evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hi john keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi just on that loan growth topic i know you have also indicated you do expect new loan origination to pick up as you look through i mean in what areas do you think that youre going to be able to see the better opportunities begin to emerge i know demand is modest as you just said and line utilization weaker so what areas do you see that anecdotal evidence of a pickup that could drive accelerating originations and balance sheet growth as you look through christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure so the first area that i would say would be people doing strategic things so sort of a whole transaction business which is just starting to get legs under it we have a significant backlog for example in ma that would be an opportunity john other businesses that are really capitalintensive where we have leadership positions in are things like renewables i was out calling with our renewables team last week incredible amount of opportunity by the way this is partially inflationary because theres a ton of stimulus around green energy thats a huge opportunity affordable housing still a huge unmet need that is very very capitalintensive and then i think youll start to see people really start to invest in property plant and equipment if we continue to get an acceleration in inflation youre going to see people start to go a little long on inventory those are the areas where i think therell be opportunities for loan growth were not really seeing those right now but i think theyll develop over the course of the year john john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks for that chris chris related to that is any of the weakness related to bond market disintermediation right now christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp for sure when you have record issuance of investmentgrade debt and you have spreads that continue to grind in theres no question that that plays a role john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks and then lastly on the ib and capital markets revenues i know you indicated that you do expect some pullback in fees in the second quarter in what areas is that in the ib area just given the levels that you saw this quarter and maybe if you can help quantify the magnitude of that pullback that you could see in the second quarter christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah so let me kind of start at the top from a backlog perspective we are at record backlogs in our ma business our backlogs are above where they were a quarter ago and theyre above where they were at yearend keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 having said that when the 10year is gyrating around as it is if the 10year was just at i think thered be a lot of transactions but i think anytime theres this kind of volatility it causes pause on certain transactions and so that was really the premise of my comment as we look at what will come out of the backlog in the second quarter and im sure because that the first quarter was actually hospitable to getting transactions done im sure some that would have been in the second quarter actually went into the first quarter john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure operator thank you our next question is from scott siefers from piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the question chris was hoping you could address in a bit more detail the decision to build the reserve a bit more sounds like from your prepared remarks youre just sort of trying to be out in front of anything you might see in a higherforlonger environment rather than anything youre actually seeing today is that the right way to think about it or what are sort of the nuances in there christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah actually it was completely proactive i just i am of a mindset that were in this higher for longer and as a consequence we have been stressing all of our portfolio and anytime we do that we start with anything thats leveraged because thats most vulnerable then we also focused a lot on real estate and so as we go through and we make assumptions that perhaps these rates will stay where they are for some time thats whats driving it and also we make some assumptions about my view is we probably will have a recession and thats part of the my macro view is part of the calculus as well r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then maybe we can jump to expenses for a quick second so just curious around how youre thinking about expenses sort of holistically for the year insofar as we definitely are getting a more normalizing investment banking environment which is great but there could be costs accompanied with that within the expense outlook what kind of provisions have you made for that ib recovery and would you still be kind of comfortable with the guide even if that recovery comes back even more powerfully than is currently contemplated clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah hey scott its clark thanks for the question keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey clark clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp so look we feel good on the guide kind of relatively stable plus or minus that incorporates as we talked about progression towards normalization if we get something fuller i think we can absorb that obviously we werent expecting coming into the year the additional fdic charge so thats an extra component we will continue to look at ways to absorb that intelligently but we think we can cover the impact of a strong investment banking year which again we expect to see even if the second quarter is a little bit lighter so we did account we think for that pretty well r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you very much clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yes operator and the next question is from manan gosalia from morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to follow up on the blackstone partnership and just in general with partnerships with private credit in terms of underwriting the loans do you underwrite the loans and is it your sole decision does the private credit partner come in and how does it impact spreads in term and structure as you do more of these relationships clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah hey manan its clark thanks for the question first of all i think its just important to understand the rationale behind the partnership and that is largely to support more clients not to manage capital or move loans off the balance sheet its really for us largely in our specialty finance area thats been growing very aggressively its been an outstanding business but we do think thoughtfully about managing credit concentrations and this is the opportunity to do that and not limit the amount of clients we can serve keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 so i think that strategic rationale is really important as it relates to underwriting we basically run the business do the underwriting blackstone has an option to participate in these credits if they fit their box but obviously if we entered and announced a relationship weve been very deep with them on what the box looks like and what it reflects and we think our business reflects market conditions as does their appetite so we would expect this to go well its a oneyear deal and we will test the relationship over the course of the year we hope it goes very positively because if it does were supporting a lot more clients and prospects in growing our business and again given our we think differentiated distribution model we dont necessarily always need to grow the balance sheet to grow the business but this is a case where we would expect to actually do both wed expect to continue to grow this portfolio but moderate some of that growth with a partner well get a modest asset management fee to do that one that we think makes sense to both sides and again well test it through the year and if theres more opportunities to do this with blackstone or others well investigate those where they allow us to serve more clients and serve them better manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so in addition to the fee side does it also help you with deposits because you can have more relationships with larger corporates clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah i mean last i checked blackstone wasnt in the business of taking deposits or providing payment services and we are so we like those kind of deals manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc fair enough okay and then as a followup on the loan review can you throw some more light on what you learned in specific industries which are the industries that are seeing more pressure and then in your role as a special servicer as well on the commercial real estate side can you shed some more light on what youre seeing there christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure so let me start if i could on what were seeing in our servicing business our servicing business as you can imagine we look at what goes in and out of active special servicing and as you can well imagine office continues to be the largest area by far we have seen some multifamilies start to go into our active special servicing and those are typically deals that were done at very low cap rates that were highly leveraged and as a consequence are very sensitive to the significant rise in interest rates as it relates to our strategic review as i mentioned we always start with anything thats leveraged but a few industries that i would bring out to your attention one obviously is real estate we spend a lot of time looking at real estate very sensitive to interest rates the other one is healthcare healthcare is an area where we have a very significant strategic hold and theres no question that theres going to be a lot of consolidation in healthcare because a lot of healthcare companies are under a myriad of cost pressures and the other thing area where we saw some was just consumer services broadly those are the areas keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure operator and the next question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning ebrahim clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just had one followup chris when you talked about your outlook for a recession the stress testing on your loan book for the higherforlonger i guess the markets have generally been wrong expecting higher rates to push the economy into a recession i guess from your perspective bottoms up when you assume higher for longer do you see a lot of pain within your loan book months out that causes you to have that feel im just trying to wonder are higher for longer enough in a world where the economy could continue to surprise to the upside in terms of growth just how do you think about it especially when you are stress testing these loans christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp so in terms of just higher for longer as you look at our book and you look at higher for longer works just fine for us from an nii perspective that would be the best outcome just from pure nii i will tell you id like to see a perfect scenario for key would be a couple cuts late in the year because i think that would be good for business fees deposits transactions et cetera as i think about the economy my sort of word of caution here is if you look at the labor market the labor market is very strong by any metric and i just think everyone assuming that theres going to be a soft landing without damaging the labor market i hope the markets are right about that im not so sure so thats sort of my thinking if thats helpful ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 thats helpful and i guess just bigger picture i mean i think its been an interesting last months for key in terms of rwa optimization expense focus et cetera remind us as we look forward strategically like the one or two things youre most focused on is it still in terms of optimizing the balance sheet expenses growth like what should we be thinking about as we think about just coming out of this and where the next leg of growth comes for the bank christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure so coming out of so theres no question that was a reset year for key for all the reasons that you just pointed out and im really proud of what we did shrinking rwas by billion taking out about million of expenses having said that as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we now ebrahim are playing offense and what that involves is us leaning into areas where we already have i think a good competitive position payments investment banking wealth and i mentioned business banking as well because i think as we go forward the loantodeposit ratios are going to be really really important we as you know have taken our loan todeposit ratio down to i think kind of mid is where people are going to have to be as you lean into these businesses that are really kind of feecentric businesses so thats where were leaning in thats where were investing ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thank you operator thank you the next question is from mike mayo from wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc look chris i know capital markets is your baby from times past i guess when i look at yeartoyear growth that was still lagging the big five us players so just a good time for a reminder of who is keybanc capital markets whats your mix among advisory debt underwriting equity underwriting whats your typical size of the client what are your key metrics for keybanc capital markets and where do you stand with regard to those metrics keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure thats a great question obviously we on a percentage basis are more canted toward advisory these are middle market companies a lot of them arent going to the equity markets very often and if theyre huge equity deals those are always led by bulgebracket firms so ours is heavily canted toward ma the good news there mike is that weve talked before ma pulls through a lot of the other things that we do financing hedging et cetera so we feel good about where were positioned but the difference probably as you go if you went through all the numbers the difference would be that some of the largest banks obviously are the players in investment grade issuance and the players in large equity issuance clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah and the only mike its clark the only other point id add there is a lot of the volume in the first quarter was billionplus deals or very large cap than what we do some work with them we are a middle market focused bank so i think thats some of the delta on things like ma mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then when you talk about the multiplier effects from mergers because you said backlogs are up quarterover quarter backlogs are up yearoveryear i guess you expect some good growth this year after the second quarter how could you quantify that multiplier effect is that like does it vary christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp it would be the latter it varies mike but i did say that our ma backlog is at record highs and for us that is the most important because if you think about it if you have the relationship the ma relationship by definition youre talking to in these middle market businesses the decision maker so i feel good about how were positioned but keep in mind these markets things are not yet normalized theyre getting back to normal but theyre not yet normalized and as i mentioned earlier it isnt the absolute level of interest rates that i think has a dampening effect i think the volatility in interest rates forces people to the sideline and to wait things out and so we need some settling in of rates it doesnt much matter frankly where that is as i said a 10year would be just fine to transact but what we cant have is just extreme volatility mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last one on that where is keybanc capital markets revenues when you look out over say a 10year horizon because i know the whole industry was down by almost half last year and youre kind of bouncing off low levels but specifically for you guys where are you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp well i mean i think if you look at our normalized investment banking if you figure million to million in sort of normalized kind of times and as you know because youve followed us for some time thats been a keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 doubledigit cagr and theres no reason why we cant get back to that level of growth if you think about years and you look at the years prior mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp no thank you mike operator thank you our next question is from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi chris hi clark christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey gerard morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc clark you mentioned about the loan portfolio how you purposely exited single credit relationships and chris you talked about building the business bank deposit base better can you guys give us some more color on these types of credits that youve pushed out were they syndicated loans since it was only a loan relationship and then the second getting back to that business bank chris how does that differ from the commercial bank because i think you said its two different business lines christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah so let me take the first one first gerard so in a lot of cases well we have a relationship strategy and we had these relationship review sessions where we see what kind of penetration we get and often we let bankers many times it starts by sort of lagging into being a participant in a sector that were really really good and we think we can do a lot of things and have a lot of capabilities and its just a matter of being really disciplined and if we actually provide a loan and ive often said a properly graded loan cant return its cost of capital and so it actually is destroying value unless you can cross out were really proud of what we can do but if we cant penetrate that client we need to exit that client to free up the capital to put it someplace where we can make the kind of returns and so that was just the exercise obviously it had a huge amount of attention and our timeframe of acceptance contracted a bit last year when we were going through the exercise as it relates to business banking it is the same business as middle market except that you need to be really focused on the payments piece because as i said theyre mostly depositcentric businesses and thats the keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 reason that weve restructured in november of last year and put our payments business together with our middle market business and we think thats going to be critical to being able to go down market and really serve these smaller commercial businesses that we think we have a differentiated product offering gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and chris when you talk about the deepening of the relationship with these customers that may only have a loan or a deposit relationship aside from payments what are those other products that you can use to deepen that relationship to make it more profitable christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp well sure well it starts with and certainly through last years exercise the first thing that we went to customers and said we need your deposits so it starts as simple as getting the deposits and i think or so of our businesses we have multidimensional relationships the next thing that we focus on is payments weve been investing in payments for a long time and for these middle market businesses its not just moving money around but its providing information embedded banking and so forth and then of course we have the ability to help them hedge we have the ability to raise capital for them and then obviously the ultimate is being able to give them strategic advice were fortunate that because were structured around industries we can do all of those things but we cant do those things if the company isnt receptive to our ideas gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup question i know you guys addressed what you did in the deep dive for looking at the portfolios in the criticized loan increase can you give us the number one two or three reasons a loan moved into criticized was it a loan to value degradation or was it the debt service coverage what was kind of the main factors that pushed them into criticized christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp its debt service coverage gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp so i mean the first thing we focus on is debt service coverage and for purposes of this we completely delink any secondary source of repayment and we assume that the only source of repayment is the primary source and that of course is straightup cash flow gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 appreciate it thank you chris christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure operator thank you our final question will come from the line of peter winter from da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst da davidson thanks good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst da davidson chris you mentioned in your opening remarks that youre ready to play offense again but sounded a little bit cautious on periodend loan growth can you just talk about the loan commitments loan pipelines and how youre thinking about loan utilization in the second half of the year christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah so i dont think those things are incongruent we clearly are playing offense were out hiring people were focusing on the business that im mentioning having said that because of our business model we are not seeing huge loan demand and so if you think about utilization were basically flat at and weve been flat at for the last few quarters our loan book is building and theres no question that our backlog is not its higher than it was but its not at historical standards peter j winter q analyst da davidson got it okay clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp and peter i might just say sorry its clark i might just say thematically and i think chris has hit this a couple times and maybe just to summarize a little bit i think for us when we say were playing offense we think that looks like disciplined loan growth in our targeted verticals which weve been i think very consistent about over time i think its funded by quality deposit growth from commercial and consumer clients and its monetized through a series of we think leading fee platforms that build that broader relationship so we think thats the recipe and when were doing those things and they dont always come together and they dont always come necessarily in that order but when were doing and running our business in the relationship manner that we intend to thats what it feels like keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 peter j winter q analyst da davidson got it and then can i ask if the outlook has a pretty strong momentum in the margin for this year and youve mentioned a more normalized margin is closer to would you expect to get near that level maybe towards the end of next year clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah im focused on confirming guidance for this year peter but its a totally fair question i do think its a function a little bit of the shape of the curve and absolute rates but as ive said before i think based on the business model we have in a normal kind of upward sloping to at least flatter yield curve i think thats achievable so it is a function i cant predict where that yield curve is going to be in but i think as our positions burn off we get more to the type of balance sheet we want to have and you get a little bit normalized rate environment regardless maybe of even absolute levels of rates but just direction of the curve i think thats very achievable peter j winter q analyst da davidson got it thanks for taking the questions christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah thank you operator thank you we do have a couple other questions that just queued up steve alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hello this is janet lee on for steve alexopoulos just following up on johns question earlier on investment banking and capital markets are you maintaining your stance that youre progressing towards this normal level of million to million range for ibs this year because if i look at absent a doubledigits decline in ib fees in the second quarter it looks like youre on pace to exceed that normal level is that fair way to describe and where is that decline in ib fees expected in the second quarter mostly coming from is it debt capital markets commercial mortgage can you provide more insight clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yes this is clark janet so we would be consistent with where we were before which is kind of that million to million range we think that feels right we do think theres upside to that but as chris mentioned well be down in the second quarter i think thats a function of not necessarily any one area because the rate volatility i think is causing some hesitancy in a few different places that doesnt change our outlook for the year but i dont think at this point were totally prepared to say that well go to kind of a whole normalized view keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and just one followup on your loan review i understand that office cre is a very small portion of your overall portfolio and as youve done the reappraisals on the properties on i guess including office if you have like what percentage of decline youre generally seeing on your office and whats happening to the updated cash flows from the landlords any insight you could share on that clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah i think well have to come back a little bit on office just to make sure we have those numbers right its not a huge portfolio and while were watching it i just dont have those details in front of me janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thanks for taking my questions christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure operator we do have a question from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you i have a quick followup for you guys clark can you share well you talked about the blackstone relationship and i think you mentioned that theyll participate in the specialty finance originations how does this relationship differ from the other relationships you guys have had chris obviously you have always pointed out the originatetodistribute model was one of your key metrics here and i was just curious how this one with blackstone is going to differ from what youve already had in place for years christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah so this is just a lot more formalized in that we actually work together and we actually service it and were together focused on this certain asset class but to your point weve been distributing the preponderance of everything we originate forever including to a lot of the credit funds so its a formalization and most importantly its a forward flow agreement so whereas weve always participated on a dealbydeal basis this is an arrangement as we go forward clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp and gerard just on the concentration point because it is a concentration management tool this allows us to do it kind of at origination and not in this book historically we didnt do a lot of syndications we would do securitizations on a clientbyclient basis but that takes time as you know so this allows us to do it kind of on the fly as were going and manage that concentration keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i got it and then just a quick followup on it have you guys worked with blackstone in the past before this agreement or is this your first initial foray with them christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp no weve worked on a transactional basis with blackstone in the past for certain gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it okay thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey thank you gerard operator thank you and we have a question from john pancari from evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi hi sorry for the followup just one quick followup here chris i believe you just mentioned in discussing your criticized assets that you delink secondary source of repayment when youre considering the credits ability to repay in your criticized status does that mean you exclude and dont consider any recourse agreement that you have with either financial sponsors or the underlying borrower christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thats correct so were looking at straightup cash on cash whats the cash flow whats the ability to service the debt based on the cash flow ph so were seeing of course john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay and you exclude that recourse christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thats right john pancari q analyst evercore isi sorry go ahead keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah so its a conservative perspective for sure ill give you an example we have because i just looked through all of these we have a company that has a market cap of say billion but theyre having some near term operational challenges they for example would be on the list of criticized assets just to give you an idea clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah and just to be clear john as chris said its the primary repayment for the risk rating which is what gets declassified we then take into account the secondary pieces when we think about ultimate loss content john pancari q analyst evercore isi right okay got it thanks clark all right appreciate it operator and we have a question from mike mayo from wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just a big picture question you stressed weak loan growth and im just wondering is that a sign the economys not as strong as people think it is i mean youre in a lot of different states in the us or is it simply your commercial clients saying hey we want to borrow were just going to wait for rates to drop christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp i think its both mike i think i have not seen a lot of people making significant investments in property plant and equipment and im not seeing people make significant investments in inventory in technology and in people so i think its a combination of both i think rates clearly have an impact but i think uncertainty as to the path and direction of the economy is also a factor mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so this is more a concern among the decision makers about whats their ultimate cost of capital due to the volatility in rates than it is some underlying hey were going into a recession right now christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp no i think its both im not saying that they think that were going to go into a recession but i think theres just a lot of uncertainty about the path of the economy will the fed engineer a soft landing kind of very similar to the conversation weve been having this morning mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thank you keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure mike operator and at this time there are no further questions in queue please continue with your closing remarks brian mauney directorinvestor relations
