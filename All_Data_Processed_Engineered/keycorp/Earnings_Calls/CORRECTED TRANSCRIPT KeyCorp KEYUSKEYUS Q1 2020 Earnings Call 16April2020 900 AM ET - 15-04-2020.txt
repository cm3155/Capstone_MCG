covid19 pandemic importantly we are operating from a position of strength our business model and clear strategy position us well during this period of economic and financial stress but importantly will provide us with significant opportunities through the recovery phase i want to affirm our longterm targets have not changed and on the other side of this crisis we expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage and strong financial returns in this environment credit quality also plays a critical role although some would continue to view key through the lens of the financial crisis the reality is that we are a different company today in terms of our strategy our risk profile and our leadership team we have significantly reduced our exposure to highrisk sectors and industries and have positioned key to perform well through all phases of the business cycle including highly stressed environments like the one in which we are operating today our moderate risk profile also informs our credit decisions and the way we underwrite loans don will share more detail with respect to our credit measures and our adoption of cecl keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 the final section of this slide focuses on capital and liquidity both clear strengths for our company key along with other major banks have participated in several rounds of governmentmandated stress tests since the financial crisis these tests have shown that key would remain well capitalized through periods of severe economic and financial stress while continuing to support our clients our liquidity position also remains strong with a combined billion in liquid assets and unused borrowing capacity let me close my remarks by reaffirming our confidence in the longterm outlook for our company although our industry clearly faces nearterm challenges we believe the steps we have taken over the past decade to strengthen and reposition our company will set key apart we have a consistent and targeted business strategy focused on relationships we have a strong capital position and disciplined approach in the manner in which we deploy our capital we have significant sources of liquidity we have dramatically derisked our company over the last several years and also we have a management team that is dedicated to helping our clients and our communities manage through these challenging times and finally since this is beth mooneys last earnings call as ceo i want to acknowledge the outstanding leadership she has provided our company beth will offer a few remarks after don but i just want to say it is not lost on any of us that our strong foundation and clear sense of purpose is in no small part due to beths leadership over the past nine years as i have said before i could not have asked for a better partner and we wish her well in the next stage of her journey with that let me turn the call over to don to report on the quarter donald r kimble chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thanks chris im now on slide this morning we reported first quarter net income from continuing operations of per common share the current quarters results have clearly been impacted by covid19 pandemic whose impacts include provision expense exceeded net chargeoffs by million timing is everything in the first quarter cecl we experienced the impact of a global pandemic through february our credit quality and economic outlook resulted in a stable allowance for loan losses compared to january level the vast majority of the increase reflects the changed economic outlook marketrelated valuation adjustments totaled million these adjustments include million of reserves on our customer derivatives reflecting the marketimplied default rates given the significant increase in credit spreads the remainder of million is due to trading losses or portfolio marks once again related to the widening credit spreads in the market one other area of impact was our investment banking debt placement fees the actual results for the quarter are approximately million below our expectations in the pipeline from just a month ago ill cover many of the remaining items on this slide in the rest of my presentation turning to slide total average loans were billion up from the first quarter of last year driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans commercial loans reflect about billion in growth in the month of march alone including increased line draws and shortterm liquidity facilities provided to customers keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 its important to note that approximately of the ci draws in march came from investmentgrade customers consumer loans benefited from the strong growth from laurel road and our residential mortgage business laurel road originated million of student consolidation loans this quarter and we generated billion of residential mortgage loans the investments we have made in these areas continue to drive results and importantly adding highquality loans to our portfolio linkedquarter average loan balances were up for next quarter line draws and other commercial loan growth are expected to slow from the march level we will however show strong growth reflecting the impact of the ppp program as chris mentioned we have processed over applications representing billion of requests and the fundings are occurring quickly this program is critical to our customers and we are pleased to support these efforts importantly we have remained disciplined with our credit underwriting and we have walked away from business that does not meet our moderate risk profile we are a different company than we were a decade ago we remain committed to performing well through the business cycle and we manage our credit quality with this longerterm perspective continuing on to slide average deposits totaled billion for the first quarter of up billion or compared to a yearago period and down from prior quarter the linked quarter decline reflects the expected reduction in several temporary deposit balances early in the quarter growth from the prior year was driven by both consumer and commercial clients its also important to note that deposit flows since february have funded the loan growth continuing to support our strong liquidity position total interestbearing deposit costs came down basis points from the prior quarter reflecting the impact of lower interest rates and the associated lag in pricing we would also expect deposit costs to continue to decline approximately to basis points in the second quarter we continue to have a strong stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for of our total deposit mix turning to slide taxable equivalent net interest income was million for the first quarter of compared to million in the first quarter of and million in the prior quarter our net interest margin was for this quarter compared to for the first quarter of and for the prior quarter compared to the prior quarter net interest income increased million driven by an improved balance sheet mix and strong loan growth our net interest margin for the quarter reflects the improved balance sheet mix looking into the second quarter as a result of expected originations of the ppp loans we would expect net interest income to increase from the first quarter level net interest margin should decline as the yield on these loans is lower than other loan products moving to slide keys noninterest income was million for the first quarter of compared to million for the yearago quarter and million in the prior quarter the current quarter clearly reflected the impact of the pandemic on our marketsensitive businesses keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 other income a negative million for the quarter reflected million of marketrelated valuation adjustments this included million of reserves for our customer derivatives due to significant increases in credit spreads the cumulative reserve recorded for this portfolio now exceeds the total losses recognized in this area through the great recession the reserves will come down if credit spreads narrow from march levels the remaining portion of the market related valuation adjustments include million of trading losses or marks also driven by the increased credit spreads two other areas of note operating lease income for the quarter included an million valuation adjustment and consumer mortgage income reflected billion of originations with higher gain on sales levels offset by million of msr impairment going into the second quarter we would not expect further meaningful marketrelated valuation adjustments most other fee income categories would be down slightly reflecting lower activity levels investment banking and debt placement fees are challenging to predict at this time now turning to slide expense levels trended down this quarter as the results reflect the benefit of efficiency improvements and lower variable compensation adjusting for notable items in the prior quarter compared to the yearago period noninterest expense declined million despite the addition of laurel road in april compared to the prior quarter adjusting for notable items noninterest expense declined million lower incentive compensation costs correlated to revenues contributed to this decline business services and marketing both were down seasonally this quarter turning to slide cecl was adopted january of this year resulting in an increase to our allowance for loan losses as of the end of the year of million consistent with previous disclosures through february our cecl reserves remain very stable reflecting the credit quality of the portfolio and the economic forecasts were consistent with the start of the year by the end of the quarter the economic outlook changed considerably reflecting the expected impact of the pandemic while no one knows the depth or duration of the economic downturn we updated our cecl reserves to incorporate a severe downturn in economic activity with the recovery beginning late in the year this change in economic outlook resulted in provision expense exceeding net chargeoffs by million as we progress through the current quarter we will better be able to refine our outlook including the potential depth and duration of the downturn it should also provide additional insights into the benefit from the various programs implemented by our government to help our customers and the economy now turning to slide despite the build in our allowances our credit quality metrics remain strong as of march net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average of total loans in the first quarter which continues to be below our overthecycle range of to basis points nonperforming loans were million in the quarter reflecting a million increase from our reclassification resulting from the adoption of cecl adjusted for this reclassification npls increased million from the prior quarter nonperforming loans represent basis points of period end loans flat with the prior quarter and prior year criticized loans increased modestly reflecting the impact of market conditions and loan rating changes in our oil and gas portfolio keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 during march the increase in commercial line draws and temporary liquidity facilities generally related to our highly rated customers at the end of the quarter the percent of our commercial loan book outstanding to investmentgrade customers actually increased by basis points one other area we continue to monitor is the level of assistance requests from our customers as of the end of last week we had received approximately requests from our retail customers about of accounts we also received approximately similar requests from our commercial customers while this is still early request levels have been less than we originally expected turning to slide we received questions about the exposure to certain industry or customer groups given the current environment included on this slide is a summary of those areas as you can see most of those areas represent a small portion of the overall portfolio and are diversified by type and geography we have implemented an enhanced monitoring process providing more active reviews often weekly of relationships that might be more vulnerable to the current environment the outstanding balances shown are of march and reflect some of the draw activity that occurred late in the quarter now on to slide capital ratios this quarter reflected the impact of the balance sheet growth and lower earnings most of our planned capital actions for the quarter were completed before the economic outlook turned as a result our common equity tier ratio was as of march down basis points from yearend this level is slightly below our target range but well above the stress capital buffer levels required by the fed our capital target was established to provide sufficient capital to operate in stressed environments recognizing we would be operating at levels below the target as we experience the impact of those environments this capital level provides a sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and based on our current outlook maintain our dividend as a reminder our capital priorities continue to be to support organic growth to continue our strong common dividend to repurchase shares with excess capital the new guidelines for the stress capital buffer are also helpful in addressing our capital actions as announced earlier we suspended our share buybacks through the second quarter on slide we provided our best insights and highlevel comments for the second quarter given the uncertain economic outlook for the full year we have removed our guidance for full year there is still a wide range of scenarios on the depth and duration of the economic downturn also impacting this will be the benefit of various programs to help bridge the retail and commercial customers as we move through the second quarter we expect to have more clarity on the economic impact of covid19 and the support provided to our clients allowing us to provide more visibility on our full year outlook loan growth should remain strong reflecting the balances as of the end of the first quarter the production levels expected from the ppp loan program and continued strength in our commercial and consumer loan originations deposits will show good growth driven by both consumer and commercial areas this growth would support much of the loan growth noted above net interest income is expected to be up from the first quarter level driven by growth in loans we expect net interest margin to decline reflecting the dilutive impact of the ppp program for noninterest income we would keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 not expect further meaningful marketrelated valuation adjustments most other fee income categories would be down slightly reflecting lower activity levels investment banking and debt placement fees are challenging to predict at this time noninterest expenses are expected to be relatively stable for next quarter net chargeoffs should increase slightly to around the lower end of our targeted range of to basis points the environment continues to change rapidly which can impact the outlook in the comments weve provided finally shown at the bottom of the slide are our longterm targets given the economic downturn we would not expect to achieve all these targets this year however as we emerge from the current crisis we expect to be back on the path that would lead us to operate within these targeted ranges importantly we have not wavered from our commitment to achieve our longterm targets before we turn the call back over to the operator beth would like to add some closing comments beth beth elaine mooney chairman chief executive officer director keycorp thank you don and good morning its with a lot of mixed feelings that i approach the end of my time at key and as ive said before being the ceo of this great company has been the privilege and the highlight of my career and i will always be proud to have been part of this team ive also enjoyed meeting many of you on the line today and recognize the important work you do for our industry ive been at key for years and years of those as our ceo and ive worked with some incredibly talented and dedicated individuals and collectively we have created a different company financially strong valuesbased and dedicated to providing unparalleled service to our clients never more important than the times we find ourselves in in addition to serving on keys board of directors i also had the privilege of serving on the boards of some of the leading industrial technology and health care providers in the country which provides me with a vantage point across a large part of our economy and while i recognize the nearterm challenges i continue to see strong underlying business that will weather the current environment and lead us through to the recovery phase let me wrap things up with a comment on our ceo transition chris will assume the role as keycorps ceo on may and our transition has been very smooth and seamless i am confident in chris and in our leadership team and indeed of all of our teammates who are fully engaged and committed to not only navigate the current environment but ultimately take our company to the next level and deliver value for all of our stakeholders and with that let me turn the call back to the operator for the qa portion of the call thank you keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions and we will go to the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thank you for taking the question so first beth congratulations and best wishes in the future beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp thank you r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah so the question i wanted to ask don maybe its most appropriate for you just a little more detail please on the assumptions that went into the cecl reserve maybe anticipated gdp contraction unemployment et cetera and then maybe just a followup what in your mind would it take to require a repeat of the level of reserve build from the in future quarters donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp sure great question scott and as far as our economic scenarios we used a number of the recent moodys scenarios to forecast to inform our cecl reserve that each of these scenarios included a severe reduction in gdp and a significant increase in unemployment levels i would say that our outlook assumed gdp will be negative through the third quarter and still be in the high singledigit range as far as negative gdp impact and then also unemployment would also be in the high singledigit level through the end of the year only a modest recovery in the fourth quarter is assumed and we have tried to incorporate some impacts from some of the programs that have been in place from the government but its difficult to fully estimate what those are at this point in time as far as the increase that we experienced this quarter weve really gone from an outlook that would have shown gdp growth in the to range and unemployment levels in the to range to where youre seeing both of those have a significant or severe reduction as far as our economic outlook and so dont know how to predict whether to see that type of a return again or not but i would say that well have to continue to assess that throughout the quarter and as we wrap up the june results well be in a position to better assess that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and maybe just final question maybe a little more visibility into whats actually happening with the line of credit draws that youre seeing im assuming theyve been largely redeposited but you guys i think have really unique seasonality in your deposit flows anyway so the first quarter i think tends to be kind of weaker for you guys so it makes it i guess a little less obvious from the outside whats going on so maybe just any additional color there please keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp yeah scott youre absolutely right if you look at the average balances especially on the deposit side you see a downward trend from fourth quarter to first quarter that really was driven by significant temporary deposits that were in place throughout the fourth quarter we knew they would go out in early first quarter and they did as i mentioned on the call weve seen deposit flows match the loan growth from end of february to now weve seen over billion of inflow over that same time period and about billion of loan growth we saw about billion of line draws and about billion of liquidity facilities that were used to replace commercial paper borrowings for our customers and on the line draws were seeing a good percentage of those reinvested or redeposited back into our bank for deposit flows and so thats part of the reason why were seeing the strong deposit growth in the month of march and early april r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you very much donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thanks scott operator and our next question is from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start on slide where you guys are calling out the select commercial portfolios based on the weekly monitoring youre now doing can you give us a sense as to the magnitude of cash flow disruption that youre seeing in these segments and maybe if you know how many are participating in government programs would be helpful too donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp sure as far as those industries but ill ask mark to comment a little bit later as far as cash flows but i would say generally for the areas that we are monitoring we have seen cash flows continue to be a little bit higher than what keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 we might have expected for certain areas including commercial real estate and other activities as far as the assistance as i mentioned before just through the ppp program we had customers request those loans and were well on our way as far as getting those through approval of the sba and onto funding and so we have over of those applications already through that approval stage as far as additional insights on cash flows mark anything else you would add on those higher risk areas mark w midkiff a chief risk officer keycorp i think you noted or chris noted that weve had approximately customers that have come to us asking for some level of deferral in the commercial categories and so i would id make that comment thats been inside of a couple billion dollars steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp steve the only thing i would this is chris the only thing i would add obviously most impacted would be things like consumer behavior restaurants sports entertainment leisure travel obviously very significantly impacted and on the other side of the equation leveraged lending we always talk any time we talk about portfolios we always talk about any place theres leverage that portfolio wouldnt necessarily have seen the kind of impact from cash flows that some of the others had q 05v30ne steve alexopoulos right thank you and given the large reserve increase this quarter can you give us a sense of what the reserves are on these buckets that youre calling out in the slide the specific reserves donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp we havent shown the reserves on those categories well see if we can add that in future disclosures in our slide deck we do show the reserves by loan category and so i think thats helpful just to get some insight as to how that reserve compares to the current levels of chargeoffs and its also a good benchmark to show compared to other peers because we think that by loan category theyre fairly consistent with what weve seen so far for some of the larger banks that have announced already steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and finally for beth you spent the last several years changing many aspects of keycorp right top to bottom including the credit risk profile of the company are you guys pretty confident here that youre going to come through this credit cycle as a top performer on credit specifically beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp well thanks steve and indeed we did spend a lot of focus and time on the strength of our balance sheet and our risk profile as well as our liquidity and being good stewards of our capital and we did it to position ourselves keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 for stronger financial performance and then importantly to prove that this company would indeed weather a downturn both as a company that could absorb its credit portfolio marks and risks and indeed be a top performer and perform better than the median and to also make sure that we couldnt extend capital and support our customers through this downturn whatever downturn it was and apparently here we are and as you can tell in the face of this we indeed are extending that support both through the ppp program as well as line draws and im highly confident with the team with the positioning of this balance sheet with our risk profile and what will be our future performance steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for the color and very good luck on your retirement beth beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp thank you steve operator our next question is from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks i guess maybe starting off with loan growth obviously don on an end of period basis its really really strong im sure youve had conversations with some of your larger borrowers how do you envision those balances trending over the next couple quarters i mean is this just a temporary drawdown is this something a little more permanent thanks christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp ken its chris we as you can imagine through this time period have been talking to a whole bunch of our customers as it relates to these larger investment grade companies that youre referring to first were getting obviously a significant amount of deposits but as the markets continue to stabilize and they clearly have by a whole lot of metrics i look for a lot of that to be taken out probably in the bond market probably in the next couple quarters ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then i guess maybe just in terms of second question in terms of the drawdowns how many of those borrowers i know you said is are investment grade but how many of those borrowers have like clearly defined borrowing bases or collateral that theyre borrowing against versus we hear some of the very large drawdowns they may not have like specific collateral agreements like you would on sort of your middle market customers christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp so by definition the biggest drawdowns are large investment grade companies that have access to capital ken people that are on a borrowing base would be constrained obviously by their ability to generate receivables and inventory to in fact generate additional availability keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay that makes sense and then just last question how are you guys reserving for troubled loans or so to speak trouble loans where you are providing forbearance but they just arent being classified for or as troubled i mean is that something you can build into your cecl reserves today or is that something that we see development materializing over the next couple quarters donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp our cecl reserves do anticipate that kind of migration given the economic outlook we have and on the commercial side even though we will be giving forbearance we would still be evaluating those credits as far as having those appropriately riskrated and that risk rating will be reflected in the future cecl reserves that are established for those credits and anticipated with this adjustment as well on the consumer side its going to be a little bit more challenging for as many of those might be even more based on delinquency status given some of the forbearance that are done more on a bridge capacity it might be a little bit lagged as far as the impact on those credits ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay perfect thank you donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator and our next question is from the line of erika najarian with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp good morning erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch just wanted to ask a question about how we should look at your last dfast results as a potential guide in terms of the severity of losses this cycle so a twopart question one is that over nine quarters in your last dfast you submitted in your companyrun test something an over ninequarter credit loss rate in ci and im keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 wondering what you see thats different in both positive and negative in terms of what could be playing out in this actual recession versus the scenario in that last test and also you closed laurel road after your last dfast and im wondering where do you see stress losses here and is it as simple as taking that reserve from slide and putting it over to consumer direct balances and saying okay according to this reserve keycorp is implying a loss rate as of balance sheet date on this portfolio donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp so a full question erika ill try my best to followup on that but one i would just offer up that as far as our severely adverse scenario that we just submitted to the fed just this quarter as a matter of fact it would have an economic scenario that will be much more dire than what occurred during the through time period and in that scenario we wouldve had about billion of credit losses during that ninequarter time period if you take a look at our total reserves that we have both the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded loan commitments that totaled about billion and so this is about of those combined losses that are recognized in that the biggest difference there is the duration of that stressed period that it would have assumed severely adverse impact on gdp and unemployment but they wouldve been sustained for a very long time period our current assumptions that we have is that we start to see that recovery in the fourth quarter of this year and so its a much shorter impact and that duration is much more important as far as losses and especially on the consumer side as opposed to just a vshaped type of recovery some of the initial assumptions might have included so i would say thats the biggest gap as far as the difference between that severely adverse scenario and what were showing as far as reserves as of march and as far as laurel road thats only a component of the overall direct consumer loan portfolio and i would say that the loss content that were seeing from that the performance of that portfolio continues to be very strong and were very pleased with it highly focused on doctors and dentists and thats the group right now that we want to be able to support and bridge them through this time period and the laurel road customer base and programs we offer are very helpful to be able to accomplish that so not seeing any outsized and expected stress loss for that portfolio erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it very helpful and my second question is given the magnitude of interest rate reduction late in the first quarter could you perhaps help quantify the level of net interest margin compression that you expect for second quarter donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp for second quarter theres going to be really three components that drive that interest rate margin compression keep in mind that we do expect net interest income to be up but the ppp program should have about a basis point plus or minus negative impact on margin that the loans have a contractual rate of but by the time you would factor in the loan fees associated with that its something just a little north of which is still a lowyielding loan for us in this environment second would be the increased liquidity levels that were currently maintaining north of billion in cash each night and at the fed just to make sure that we have robust levels of liquidity given potential changes in overall keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 funding mixes and what have you and thats probably up from billion to billion and so that increased liquidity will put pressure on nim not on nii but have pressure on nim and then i would say that the remaining pressure on net interest margin would probably be in that low to mid type of basis point range difference because the rate decline occurred late in the quarter and while we said that our deposit rates will be down to basis points that still would not translate to north of a beta on that change and so thats something that will put some nearterm pressure on margin as we see the lag impact of deposit pricing coming through erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and if i could just please sneak in one more theres clearly a significant amount of demand for bank balance sheet and im wondering with your common equity tier ratio at what is the level that youre comfortable drawing this ratio down to as this demand for balance sheet continues and is there anything you can do in terms of rwa mitigation to offset some of the demand from your customers donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp yeah as far as our outlook right now we would say and chris highlighted this as well that the commercial loan growth should be muted this quarter compared to what we experienced in the first quarter and were not seeing the active increased request for draws or other funding coming through from those customers second we are seeing strong loan growth but a lot of that coming from the ppp program which has a zero riskweighted component to the extent that it is fully guaranteed and will be fairly shortterm in nature and so that shouldnt put any pressure on that and then the consumer loan growth that were seeing about half of it is coming from residential mortgage which is also a low riskweighted asset and then the other half from laurel road and so we dont think well see as much pressure on the rwa as what we did this last quarter but the growth we saw at the period end cost us over basis points of rwa because of that rapid increase in some of those balances so we dont see that as an impact for us going forward i would say that as far as what level are we comfortable at well continue to monitor it but what i had said is that thats slightly below our longerterm targeted range but that was with the expectation that when things are a little more stressed we could see that drop a little bit below that level and so we do believe that we have sufficient capital to continue to play through and support our customers and support our current dividend outlook based on our current earnings projections as well so we think that were in good position there but thats something well continue to evaluate as things would evolve erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch really helpful don thank you and beth congratulations and i hope more women follow in your footsteps beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp as do i thank you erika operator next well go to the line of john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi back to the reserve i appreciate the color you gave in terms of how youre thinking about the throughcycle loss content that your reserve is at approximately of that new level that you calculated of the throughcycle losses i know other banks this earnings season have also talked about that relative size about ballpark but theyve also been indicating that they expect potential incremental loan loss reserve additions of size in coming quarters can you just talk about the likelihood of taking additional sizable increases in the next couple quarters because when you look at it you would think that you might need to be higher than of that expected loss rate in this type of crisis thanks donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp great question and i wish someone could help provide some clarity on the depth of the recession the duration of that recession and what kind of impact all these programs are having but we couldnt be more pleased with what were seeing from the treasury and from the fed and from others to help provide that bridge support for our customers and we think that will have a meaningful impact on their ability to continue to operate going forward and bring that economy back up to the level it needs to be but we dont know whats going to happen between now and june but as far as other comments if you look at the economic forecasts that have come out in early april they probably are a little bit more negative more about the recovery rate as opposed to the depth of the actual recession and so more going toward a ushaped scenario as opposed to a vshape and so well have to continue to assess that i think it will be too premature for us to speculate as to how much that reserve change could be at this point in time but if we do see more negative economic forecast as of the end of the second quarter there could be additional pressure on reserves at that point in time but its just too early to tell john sorry about that john pancari q analyst evercore isi no its okay don all right thanks and then i know youve cited the balance of the ppp loans and that youre seeing a healthy amount of appetite there and it looks like we might get an upsizing of the program so i got to assume that youre going to see greater demand over time for that what are your plans for those loans on the balance sheet are you looking to sell them and is it going to be the secondary market is it going to be the fed to their facility how should we expect that that finds its way on and off your balance sheet donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp well one were very excited about that program and we were out early and i think chris we had over outreach efforts to customers and had over customers at least express some interest in understanding keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 what the program is and as we mentioned over applications and so thats a huge percentage of our customer base and very pleased weve been able to support those the way that we have and as we looked at that program we think that the life of those loans should be fairly short that if you think about say weeks from the time that they get those loans they would be in a position potentially to ask for forgiveness against that and so we think that the life could be fairly shortterm in nature and so we will keep it on our balance sheet but as i mentioned before were having very strong deposit flows the fed and treasury have provided additional areas as far as support or funding for those assets and if deposits arent sufficient to meet those funding needs then we would have those available to us to provide that liquidity but generally i dont see any need to sell those assets as part of our operational plan christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp yeah if i could just add we are immensely proud of how our team rallied around the ppp program which we think is so important to get this country back up and moving if you think about it don mentioned the client outreaches we had more than of our teammates out working on this massive program very short timeframe and im just really proud of how the whole team came together and really went out to support these clients we also built some really great digital straightthrough processing that enabled us to basically process or years worth of sba loans over a couple weeks donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp its a good point chris that normally an annual flow for this type of a loan product with the sba indiscernible for us and weve done applications in little over a week john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it thanks don and beth best of luck in retirement beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp thank you john operator our next question is from peter winter with wedbush securities please go ahead peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning peter peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 im just wondering you guys do sit on a fair amount of excess liquidity and i was wondering where is the lcr ratio today because i thought is the thought to continue to use the securities portfolio to fund loan growth because it seems like there is a fair amount of room to remix earning assets to help the margin somewhat maybe in the second half of the year donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp peter youve been reading our playbook here that we didnt buy any new securities here in the first quarter were using some of the cash flows there to reinvest in loan growth and so we still think thats clearly available to us we have well over billion of liquidity that our lcr ratio that we would calculate now is north of so its well above what we would target the fed for a bank our size would have us in the range and were well north of that even in this environment so we will consider to evaluate how we want to manage the overall mix of the assets and that could be a continued opportunity for us especially given the reinvestment rate for those investment securities is well south of what our current portfolio is peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc what are those reinvestment rates donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp yeah we tend to have fairly shortdurated agency cmos and our current cash flow off of that is somewhere north of million as far as maturing securities the reinvestment yield today would be between and so down considerably from where it was just a quarter ago peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and then just a followup question chris with your opening remarks about going into this downturn in a much better position certainly from a capital liquidity standpoint but could you just talk about some of the biggest changes from a credit perspective heading into this downturn versus the financial crisis and then just comments that you think you could do better than peers from a credit perspective christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp sure peter so if you went back years for example ill just give you a couple things take a look at say our real estate business at that point our real estate business we wouldve had about a third of our real estate book wouldve been in construction loans today that number would be 8ish we also our real estate business at that point which is where most of our losses were incurred was principally a bookandhold kind of business and in the last decade we have built an amazing ability to distribute paper such that we dont really necessarily take any risk that we dont want to take because we have a lot of avenues whether its fannie freddie fha the life companies right now the cmbs market is not available but it will be once again its interesting peter even in these times because weve done a good job and ill stay on real estate because that is where most of our losses were we also reconfigured exactly who we want to do business with if you think about people in the multifamily business in every city theres one or two groups that really are the premier providers of multifamily and we reconfigured our complete client base and what were seeing right now is in spite of the disruption out there that our backlog is actually growing in our commercial mortgage business keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 because we have picked the people that some of the agencies want to bank so that would be just some examples of what weve done the other thing that im really proud of we are a significantly bigger business today than we were a decade ago and i mentioned leverage earlier we always focus wherever theres leverage is where theres risk and our leverage book is generally exactly where it was years ago before we grew by so those are just a couple examples its the whole concept of being able to distribute paper being able to carefully pick your clients this whole notion of targeted scale and then lastly in the case of real estate its just a completely different business peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp one more thing i would add to that as well is that under chris and beth they both shifted the overall strategy of the company to be relationship bank and having that complete relationship we have shown time and time again through as many downturns those relationship customers will perform much better than where its a lendingonly relationship or where youre not the primary bank and i would say that that subtle difference we think should better position us this time than what we experienced in the last downturn thanks peter peter winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great and i just want to wish beth best of luck in the next chapter its been great working with you all these years beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp thank you peter appreciate that operator our next question is from terry mcevoy with stephens please go ahead terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi technical difficulty sorry about that i had a followup question on the ppp program could you just talk about the average loan size because it does impact the process fee and don in response to an earlier question you kind of added that fee into the yield so i just want to make sure where thats going to run through the income statement in the second quarter whether its included in interest income like you maybe suggested or if it will come through fee income donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 sure as we mentioned before weve got about applications about billion as far as the loan value there so something north of the per average loan size and so its been a broad mix of customers thats going from our small business banking accounts to business banking to even some of our middle market customers still falling under that head count level so its been a huge program for us and very pleased with those results as far as the fees that we will be realizing on those we do expect to take those through the net interest margin and amortize it through the contractual life of those loans which is two years and so as those will be forgiven or pre paid the unamortized portion of that fee will be taken in income at that time as well terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you for that and then i guess ill ask about the main street lending program are you getting ahead of that program and what could that mean for balance sheet growth going forward christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp so terry its chris im proud of the fact that we at key along with many others in the industry have been part and parcel working with the fed and others to structure the main street program we have a whole team around it and we think its going to be helpful to some of our clients that really need some incremental funding for the main street program they wouldnt necessarily have access to additional capital we think its going to be very helpful it hasnt gotten a lot of discussion but if you look at main street and some of the other programs in the aggregate theyre about billion so its not inconsequential were working hard on it as we speak terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and beth best wishes ahead for you thank you beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp thanks terry i appreciate that operator and next we go to the line of bill carcache with nomura please go ahead bill carcache q analyst instinet llc thank you good morning don i wanted to followup on johns question regarding your cecl assumptions your comments make it very clear that theres lots of uncertainty but without getting into magnitude just direction weve heard other banks that have already reported this quarter talk about the incremental degradation in the outlook post331 with unemployment rising and gdp declining even more sharply than originally expected and some going from expecting a vshape recovery as recently as march to now anticipating more of a ushape recovery and so given those changes the suggestion there has been that theyll need to book incremental reserves in  so i guess the direct question for you guys is are the increases in initial claims that have negatively surprised many over the last two thursdays in april are those increases contemplated in your allowance or would you need to book additional reserves if those elevated unemployment figures hold donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 as far as the unemployment and gdp assumptions again we really have to wait until we get closer to the end of the quarter to make any assessments there i would say as youve highlighted that the nearterm impacts have been negative adjustments to the outlook since april but as far as im aware i havent seen any new moodys scenarios and others that we hadnt used or considered in connection with our initial assessment but i think were just again i apologize but were just way too early to try to predict whats going to happen as of june as far as the economic outlook were hitting a period here which i think will be very informative as we start to see how states and counties within states start to return to work and how quickly the economy starts to recover from that how do these programs that have been implemented help bridge those customers through this environment and this is really at a historic level as far as that support and so i wish i could give you a more direct answer but i think we need to see some of this play out before we provide any more insights as to where it might go from here bill carcache q analyst instinet llc understood thats fair thanks don i guess a separate question on the dividend some highprofile current and former regulators have suggested that it would be prudent for the banks to cut back on their dividends to the extent that the duration of the downturn is prolonged can you frame for us what it would take for key to halt its dividend donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp well continue to assess that based on what we see for the depth and duration of the downturn in our severely adverse scenario that i mentioned before that takes our common equity tier ratio to roughly and thats with the assumption that we continue our dividend at the current level and that current dividend is only million a quarter million a quarter as far as the capital utilization and so its not a high percentage as far as the overall earnings capacity of the organization its also something thats very important to our shareholders and especially our retail shareholders so well take that all into consideration we believe that were wellpositioned to continue to maintain that based on our current outlook and assessments and so we dont see that as coming to atrisk but well continue to reevaluate as we get through this quarter and beyond to see where we would see the economy trending at that point bill carcache q analyst instinet llc understood so to the extent that this were to be a prolonged downturn do you think is the decision over whether or not to suspend the dividend one that you think banks should have the freedom to make on their own or would you prefer that regulators more broadly urge banks to suspend the dividend so the entire industry is sort of in the same boat rather than having oneoff cases across individual banks just curious what your views are donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp i think if you talk to most banks we have all significantly increased our capital levels and our liquidity position since the last crisis and part of the reason for doing that was to be able to continue to support our customers in times of need and we think that were wellpositioned to do that but also where appropriate to continue to support our common dividend most if not all banks has cut out their share buybacks and thats a significant portion of the capital returns that have occurred over the last few years and so that portion has already been stopped keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 and so as we look forward the regulators may come to a point where they are recommending that the large banks do suspend dividend if they believe that things are too dire but i think that most banks would believe that were well positioned to continue to support those based on what were seeing in the economy today and based on our capital levels that we maintain bill carcache q analyst instinet llc thank you so much and let me echo beth ive enjoyed the time we spent together and certainly echo everyones congratulations as well beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp thank you bill operator our next question is from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning don wondering if you could just give us a little bit more detail on some of the fee points that you made in the guidance so first of all when you talk about the nonmarket revenues in your prepared remarks you talked about a couple of extra negatives this quarter so when youre thinking about slightly lower off of first quarter should we be adjusting for those little dings as well as much as obviously for the fair value marks donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp yeah the fair value marks are more than little dings and so credit spreads have already come in nicely since the end of the quarter and if we would snap the line as of yesterday as opposed to march 31st that million reserve for customer derivatives would be down by million already and so we think that will provide some additional support we would not expect that the ding that we mentioned as far as the operating lease adjustments that was more of a oneoff type of an adjustment as opposed to something we would see going forward if you look at some of the other revenue categories trust and investment services about half of that is related to asset values and about half of it is brokerage andor commercial activity trading account activity within that and so those levels were a little elevated this quarter which we would probably see come down a little bit i would say that cards and payments related revenues are impacted by credit card purchase card and merchant services revenues its about of that is tied to that category and we did see declines of to of those transaction volume levels at the end of the first quarter so we would expect those kind of trends initially continue into the second quarter but many of the other revenue categories could see some stability andor even increase the residential mortgage fee income was negatively impacted by million of msr impairment keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 our pipeline right now is sitting at billion which is times what it was going into the first quarter and so we should see some nice rampup in those revenues and so thats why we think that we would see some of the other revenue categories down slightly reflecting some of that activity level but being offset by some of the benefit for residential mortgage and other fee categories ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes okay great and so then your markets related really presume really speaks to the investment bank im understanding its too early maybe can you just talk about your product areas and just whats happening in those product areas youve got the cre business on one side and then your verticals obviously to your point earlier about the fair value marks the markets have improved weve seen some opening in certain places so while early just can you just maybe talk about the dynamics that the customers are talking through that youre hearing about with regards to whether pipelines move or not christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp sure ken its chris so precovid19 we had what we described as very good pipelines across the board what has impacted our business the most is the delay in ma activities obviously the whole world is in price discovery right now and its not a time when you can complete an ma transaction that also has a knockon effect of our syndication business because we finance many of the transactions in which we advise so those deals i dont think are gone but the question is when do they come back and that goes back to dons point how deep and how long which everyone is trying to figure out right now now as you step back some of our verticals that weve invested heavily in i think will be well positioned as we go forward if you think for example about health care our cain brothers platform is probably the number one adviser for facilitiesbased health care i think youre going to see massive consolidation as we come out of this the next area where weve invested a lot of time and money has been technology and i know i can speak for key we have three times as our growth rate of digital customers is three times the rate prior to covid19 and so the whole notion of softwareasaservice the whole notion of technology i think is going to be an area that goes really well another area where were focused is renewables and i dont think that is going to have much of an impact i think if you look at the push for both wind and solar and were a leader in north america i think those will remain strong so that gives you a little bit of a flavor maybe from both a product perspective and a vertical perspective ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then one just quick one on the expenses side so really good first quarter results and youre talking about stable is part of that again the reflection of the uncertainty on the markets related revenues and the slower start to the year or are there other things that youre also doing underneath what you had already done last year to continue to hold the line there thanks guys and best of luck beth beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp thank you ken keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thanks ken and we are continuing to focus on other expense initiatives and programs to help move the expense levels down i would say that some of the outlook reflects not only some revenue outlook is provided but also some of the additional efforts including what we would be seeing from a branch distribution perspective what were seeing from a current operating expense levels for supporting our current team and also includes some increased costs that were expecting because of the shutdown that were paying additional incentives to many of our team members that are required to be out in the application for their responsibilities whether its branch employees or others and weve also had to step up some costs associated with onshoring some activities where weve seen some thirdparty vendors that havent been able to provide the support that we need in certain areas and its requiring us to add some additional resources there and so each of those are reflected in that relatively stable expense outlook operator our next question is from brian foran with autonomous research please go ahead brian foran q analyst autonomous research hey good morning donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning brian foran q analyst autonomous research i was just thinking about some of your comments about the differences now versus the crisis for key i guess one of the things during the crisis that was tough was the ppnr your preprovision earnings really kind of collapsed they got down to million in and i guess this quarter even with all the charges it was over million and don i guess is it fair with all your comments even building in uncertainty for investment banking it seems like youre kind of pointing to a number of maybe million a little north of that and then bigger picture beyond the number how do you think about the importance of that ppnr being so much higher just in terms of your ability to chew through whatever the ultimate losses are donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp great question thats been a core focus of ours is continuing to maintain our positive operating leverage to deliver improvements in that core performance to see a shift of our portfolio into more of a balanced approach and so that we have a higher percentage of retailoriented businesses today than what we did before and those are critical to us i would agree that that increased level of ppnr is clearly important to us as far as supporting our dividend going forward and our overall capital position and so even in a stressed environment were still showing strong levels of ppnr to be able to support the increased credit costs that might occur in those types of environments and thats why we believe we are able to maintain those capital actions based on that type of an outlook brian foran q analyst autonomous research keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 and then maybe one followup as we think about the trajectory for capital going forward can you remind us so all of aoci is excluded from the cet1 ratio and if thats right how much flexibility would you see whether its the hedges or securities gains if you needed to access a little bit more cet1 what would be a reasonable ballpark for the flexibility that the securities gains and hedges would give you donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp the majority of the oci is backed out for capital purposes and so we are sitting in a net positive that would give us a lot of flexibility to be able to manage that common equity tier ratio up by realizing some of those security gains if we wanted to our challenge for that would be that we dont want to do it for an earnings or liquidity perspective and oftentimes youll see a degradation in the future earnings when you would swap out the securities for loweryielding securities today but it does provide us some flexibility there brian foran q analyst autonomous research great thank you so much donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator our next question is from saul martinez with ubs please go ahead saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning first of all best of luck beth and well miss working with you beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp thank you saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc so most of my questions have been asked but ill followup on a ceclrelated question maybe this is for don and for mark and its a little bit more of a broader question but its in response to erikas question and i guess id like to get your perspective on this dfast stress test and where theyre useful as a gauge to look at cecl reserve adequacy in downside case scenarios and where theyre not because and is there a risk of taking those results too literally and i ask that because beyond sort of the differences you highlighted don in terms of the economic assumptions dfast is sort of a fundamentally different exercise its meant to measure loss absorbing capital in a severe scenario and hence the construction of dfast is conservative whether its line draw assumptions or until recently asset growth its a 9quarter period and which is very different obviously from your corporate book a lot of which is much much shorter contract maturities are reserving over and cecl is a best guess estimate of a point in time estimate of what your reserves and your losses will be so its sort of a fundamentally different construct so i guess my question is keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 more how should we use that as sort of a gauge and is there a risk of taking those results and the billion you mentioned too literally as sort of a gauge of where reserves could go to even in a really severe scenario donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp saul i think youve answered the question better than i can but i would agree with your observation that the purpose for ccar is one to stress the capital and so the assumption sets that are included in that would include higher utilization continuing for an extended period of time as far as some of the commercial loan draws would include using some historic loss rates that may not be reflective of the current environment or the current portfolio levels the fed testing would include some adjustments for where the data isnt present for their models which elevates the loss content compared to what you might see another nuance is that for cecl you only provide the reserve for the loan through its maturity whereas in ccar you would assume those loans get rolled over and therefore could be subjected to future loss based on the economic scenario so its a challenge and i would say that im surprised as tightly as some of the estimates and numbers have come out from the banks that have announced so far as far as the ranges for the change in the cecl reserves i thought they would be all over the board but if you think about the variability and the different types of economic outlooks you could assume the impact in the models what kind of a reasonable and supportable period people are using and how do those revert back to the norms i would have expected even a wider variability than what were seeing today as far as the earnings announcements have come through and so i think its helpful as far as a benchmark but i dont think that its necessarily predictive as far as if we would see the economy get worse thats the reserves that would be required saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right okay no thats helpful i guess i was just i just wanted a little bit of verification that the way i was thinking about it is broadly applicable i guess just a quick followup then on the slide with the risk portfolios a clarification the leverage loan portfolio how much overlap is there in that portfolio with some of the other segments that are at risk that you highlighted there donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp i would say theres very little overlap there that i would say that generally our leverage book probably more is commercial industrial in nature as opposed to the categories that are shown chris would you have any other insights there christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp right our leverage book lines up very very strongly with our verticals that we are deep in and so there would not be a lot of overlap saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just on those risk buckets like any theres a big variance within those buckets like travel for example hotels tours and then theres air and water i guess like is there a more granular assessment keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 whereas how much hotels for example the riskier parts within those buckets is there a way to kind of gauge that because these are fairly broad categorizations for some of these for the consumer discretionary and travel gets you highlighted donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp there are some broader categories for example hotels i believe that number is between the million and billion level so a fairly small portion of the overall portfolio but well see if we can provide some additional clarity or granularity around those buckets that many of our peers have been more granular as far as commenting on where there are very specific areas of risk and these are more broader subsets and we have that so we can provide it saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah no that would be helpful thanks a lot guys donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp thank you operator and our final question will be from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning beth chris and don how are you donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp good morning beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc don maybe you can share with us obviously we know about the high risk nature of certain parts of your portfolio and your peers you just touched on about hotels and leisure types of credits if you take that and energy off the table for a moment what are the other areas of the portfolio are you all focused on in making sure that you keep a really close handle on whats going on in case this downturn extends out longer than any of us expect christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp so gerard its chris this isnt new to the pandemic weve always focused first and foremost on anything where theres a lot of leverage and so for us its our leverage book which we indicated here and its also any of keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 our real estate portfolios those are the two places where there are leverage weve been monitoring those very very closely for a very long time but those are the two areas when you think about financial and economic stress i always start with leverage gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then some of us on this call have been around for a while and we remember the us government getting involved in lending or getting involved with the banks and then subsequently changing the rules on the banks you might recall a crisis with indiscernible what happened after that fiasco and of course we had tarp and how they changed the rules on how to get out of tarp what safeguards are you guys putting up in this new program the ppp program on the mainstream lending program where youre working with the government youre helping your customers which is great everybody is working twice as hard to get this done but years from now were going to see that there were some mistakes made by the industry what safeguards are you putting in place to prevent any kind of pushback that you get i mean not just you but the industry may get years from now christopher m gorman a president chief operating officer director keycorp well first of all gerard its a great question and obviously when a program is put together in a matter of weeks thats billion we think going to another billion there its not perfectly clean and our posture was that we need to be there to support our clients and we need to be out there talking to them and helping them through this period so that was kind of our guiding principle having said that we also spent time on things like indemnification reps and warranties from the customers don do you want to add to that donald r kimble a chief financial officer chief administrative officer keycorp no i think youre right chris that weve been very careful before we even send the app in for approval from the sba that we have done our homework and weve done appropriate underwriting based on the standards that are put in place and so its been a significant effort on the teams part to ramp up to be able to address that but thats primarily our area of safeguard is making sure that we are following our understanding and our best interpretation and the guidelines and rules that are out there so we again appreciate everything thats being done from the treasury from the fed from others that are trying to help provide that bridge and we want to support our customers through that the best way that we can and so we just want to do it right but hopefully not subject ourselves to additional risk with hindsight after the dust settles gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then just finally congratulations beth you had a great run providing strong leadership to key and to women in general and good luck in your future adventures thank you beth elaine mooney a chairman chief executive officer director keycorp thank you so very much gerard and to all of you today keycorp key corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2020 operator and with
