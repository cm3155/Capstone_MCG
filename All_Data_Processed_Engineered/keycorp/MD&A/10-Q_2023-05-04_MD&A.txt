libor act the libor act addresses certain issues relating to the transition from the use of libor as a benchmark reference rate in contracts to the use of alternate reference rates among other things the libor act i provides for the replacement by operation of law of libor with a sofrbased reference rate selected by the federal reserve for contracts which do not have effective fallback language ii authorizes persons who have discretionary authority for selecting a libor replacement to opt into a statutory safe harbor from liability by selecting the benchmark identified by the federal reserve iii states that parties to a contract may opt out of the libor act and iv provides that no federal supervisory agency may take supervisory action against a bank solely because the bank uses a benchmark rate other than sofr on december the federal reserve adopted a final rule to implement the libor act the final rule establishes federal reserveselected benchmark replacements for contracts governed by federal or state law that use libor as a benchmark reference rate but do not provide for a clearly defined or practicable replacement after june when libor will no longer be available in its current form the final rule identifies separate federal reserveselected replacement rates for different categories of libor contracts including among others derivative transactions consumer loans and contracts involving entities regulated by the federal housing finance agency consistent with the libor act each replacement rate is based on sofr and incorporates spread adjustments for each specified tenor of libor the final rule also defines various terms and clarifies certain matters relating to the implementation administration and calculation of the benchmark replacement rate including clarification of who is considered a determining person able to make the decision to use the federal reserveselected rate in a libor contract in addition the final rule indicates that this rule preempts any state or local law regulation or standard relating to the selection or use of a benchmark replacement for libor or related conforming changes the final rule ensures that libor

banks loan portfolio the financial services industry has not yet adopted a standardized methodology for banks to use to quantitatively measure indirect emissions from a banks value chain such as financed emissions accordingly this proposal would require many banks to quantify and disclose financed emissions on a comprehensive scale for the first time comments on the secs proposal were originally due by may the comment period was extended to june on october the sec reopened the comment period on this proposal until november due to a technological error that resulted in a number of public comments submitted through the secs comment website not being received by the sec on december the federal reserve issued for public comment proposed principles that would provide a highlevel

policy under the rules a company must recover erroneously awarded incentive compensation reasonably promptly after such obligation is incurred rule also requires that the listing standards include disclosure requirements related to clawbacks on february the nyse and nasdaq proposed new listing standards that are substantially identical to rule under the exchange act consistent with rule the proposed nyse listing standards would require nyselisted companies including keycorp to i adopt and implement a compliant clawback policy ii file the clawback policy as an exhibit to their annual reports and iii provide certain disclosures relating to any compensation recovery triggered by the policy under the nyse proposal nyse would suspend trading and commence delisting procedures when it

attributable to key common shareholders for the three months ended march to the three months ended march  in millions net interest income one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including the volume pricing mix and maturity of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities the volume and value of net free funds such as noninterestbearing deposits and equity capital the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace asset quality and fair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interestbearing liabilities to make it easier to compare both the results across several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a te basis ie as if all income were taxable and at the same rate for example of taxexempt income would be presented as

calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations we use a historical simulation var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other noncovered positions we analyze market risk by portfolios and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type historical scenarios are customized for specific positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancellable provisions var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a confidence level for more information

a specific risk addon including the securitization positions the aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the market risk rule was million at march all of which were mortgagebacked security positions specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach market risk weighted assets including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule and approved by the chief market risk officer nontrading market risk most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk reprice risk is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interestbearing liabilities and the volume of interestearning assets they fund eg deposits used to fund loans do not mature or reprice at the same time basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floatingrate assets and floatingrate liabilities reprice at the same time but in response to different market factors or indexes yield curve risk is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity and occurs when interestbearing liabilities and the interestearning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterpartys ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets liabilities or offbalance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above in addition the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight libor transition as disclosed in item risk factors of our form 10k bank regulators have issued guidance advising against the use of libor in its current form for new contracts for most financial products the most common alternative reference rates have been and are expected to be sofrbased benchmarks this is true for both new originations and legacy libor contracts that are subject to amendment or a transition by their terms we have established an enterprisewide program to identify and address all libor transition issues related to legacy libor contracts we are collaborating closely with regulators and industry groups on the transition and closely monitoring industry practices related to libor alternatives the goals of our libor transition program include identifying and analyzing liborbased exposure and developing and executing transition strategies reviewing and updating nearterm strategies and actions for existing liborbased contracts not yet transitioned assessing financial impacts and risks while planning and executing mitigation actions understanding and strategically addressing the current market approach to libor relative to transitioning to alternative reference rates including the impact of the libor act and the federal reserves regulations as well as the fcas policy decisions related to socalled synthetic usd libor and determining and executing system and process work to be operationally ready for credit sensitive benchmarks as part of the libor transition program we completed an initial risk assessment to help us identify the impact and risks associated with various products systems processes and models this risk assessment has assisted us in making necessary updates to our infrastructure and operational systems and processes to implement a replacement rate and we have implemented various sofrbased benchmarks as determined by the affected line of business including but not limited to daily simple sofr in arrears sofr compounded in arrears sofr averages in advance and term sofr we are actively quoting alternative indexes other than libor such as sofr and term sofr and are originating new loans in those indexes we have also originated a small number of new loans using credit sensitive rates in a limited and managed fashion we have compiled an inventory of existing legal contracts that are impacted by the libor transition we have assessed the libor fallback language in those contracts have devised a strategy to address the libor transition for those contracts and are in the process of remediating such contracts our progress is wellpaced to complete the remediation of the libor portfolio by june we are leveraging recommendations made by the arrc and isda that are tailored to our specific client segments we also have evaluated the impact of the libor act on our transition strategy the legislation provides a uniform national approach for replacing libor in legacy contracts that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate as of march key had the following instruments that were either directly or indirectly dependent on libor dollars in millions maturity through june maturity past june outstanding balance of loans notional value of derivative contracts investment securities debt and equity instruments net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with managements desired interest rate risk positioning the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease from current levels over the next months subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero figure presents the results of the simulation analysis at march and march at march our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was moderate the exposure to declining rates has decreased as a result of higher funding costs and a funding mix change to more rate sensitive instruments compared to the march analysis current modeled exposure is within the board approved tolerances if a tolerance level is breached and determined inconsistent with risk appetite the development of a remediation plan is required to reduce exposure back to within tolerance figure simulated change in net interest income march march basis point change assumption assumed floor in market rates in basis points na na rising rate beta na mid na low tolerance level interest rate risk assessment nii at risk beta sensitivity march beta assumption mid low mid low interest rate risk assessment simulation analyses produce a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumption inputs within the model assumptions are tailored to the specific interest rate environment and validated on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analyses due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities or repercussions from exogenous events regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses are performed on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different yield curve shapes including steepenings or flattenings of the curve immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate changes and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts if fixed rate assets increase by billion or fixed rate liabilities decrease by billion then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately basis points if the interestbearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by eg to then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately basis points the current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows corporate treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change the interest rate risk profile simulations are also conducted that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a similar manner to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures changes in the eve are calculated as discussed in the following section economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment eve policy limits are measured against a basis pointpolicy decline scenario the policy decline scenario is equal to the current fed target rate capped at basis points as of march the policy decline scenario is minus basis points this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as forward expectations remediation plans are similarly developed if the analysis indicates that the eve will decrease by more than in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates the position is within these guidelines as of march management of interest rate exposure the results of the various interest rate risk analyses are used to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically risk positions are managed by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives interest rate swaps and options are predominantly used which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities figure shows all swap positions held for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixedpay variable interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently to reflect broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more

our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters global pandemics political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources for a discussion of certain risks which may impact our liquidity see part ii item risk factors in this report for more information on recent liquidity activity see the header our liquidity position and recent activity in this report below our credit ratings at march are shown in figure we believe these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets would enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors on april moodys affirmed all longterm and shortterm ratings and assessments of keycorp and keybank while changing keycorp and keybanks rating outlook from stable to negative related to uncertainty in the banking industry following the recent bank failures the change in outlook was part of a broader

consolidated loantodeposit ratio of as of march if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or onbalance sheet liquid reserves conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis as part of the plan we maintain onbalance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio which consists of high quality liquid assets during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strategy our available contingent liquidity at march totaled billion consisting of billion of unpledged securities billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account billion of unused secured borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and billion of unused secured borrowing capacity at the fhlb during the first quarter of our secured term borrowings increased billion as additional advances were taken to increase the level of cash held in our federal reserve account we have several liquidity programs which are described in note longterm debt beginning on page of our form 10k that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions on january keybank issued the following notes under the bank note program billion of fixed rate senior bank notes due january and million of fixed rate senior bank notes due january liquidity for keycorp the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and fund capital distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks at march keycorp held billion in cash which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance typically keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt keycorp had no debt issuances during the first quarter of during the first quarter of keybank paid million cash dividends to keycorp as of march keybank had regulatory capacity to pay billion in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval our liquidity position and recent activity over the past quarter our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has increased primarily from an increase in cash balances the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longerterm solution in response to the recent market volatility driven by the recent bank failures key has initiated heightened monitoring for liquidity and funding this heightened monitoring includes daily updates to senior management centered on balance sheet flows and reserve balances held at the federal reserve we have also increased the level of cash held at the federal reserve in the event there is an unexpected funding outflow from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares

payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit distribute credit risk purchase securities provide financial and payments products and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk credit policy approval and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the enterprise risk management committee the keybank board and the risk committee of the keycorp board for approval these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority are responsible for credit approval individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate however a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan scoring processes we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower we also set and monitor industry concentration and correlation risk by setting appropriate limits and tolerances to achieve balanced and acceptable portfolio composition levels with our desired risk profile we set measure and manage that risk consideration of both internal and external industry performance metrics domestic and global economic data and by allocating capital adequacy stress test supported capacity with highly uncertain economic conditions we maintain diligent and vigilant portfolio monitoring activities in keeping with our credit risk framework these activities include proactive higher risk portfolio segment detailed reviews this allows us greater insight

compliance risk management like all businesses we are subject to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities operational risk intersects with compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk while operational and compliance risk are separate risk disciplines in keycorps erm framework losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs are included in operational loss reporting and could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk management program serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments both the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee include attendees from each of the three lines of defense primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance risk management functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance risk management programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the audit committee and updates the risk committee as appropriate on matters related to the oversight of these controls cybersecurity we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems shut down access to systems for ransom or cause other damage as the threat landscape continues to evolve critical infrastructure including financial services remains a top target for cyberattacks the remote work environment utilized by our employees and our thirdparty service providers inherently introduces additional risk additionally we face heightened risk of cyberattacks in the near term because of recent geopolitical events which may result in increased attacks against us critical infrastructure including financial institutions cyberattacks may include but are not limited to attacks that are intended to disrupt or disable banking services and prevent banking transactions attempts to breach the security of systems and data and social engineering attempts aimed at tricking employees and clients into providing sensitive information or executing financial transactions we also face cyberattack risks related to our thirdparty service providers cyberattacks successfully compromising or circumventing the security of the systems of our thirdparty service providers have resulted in and could again in the future result in negative consequences to us including interfering with our thirdparty providers ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us an interruption in our business processes or the disclosure or misappropriation of confidential information of us or that of our clients these cyberattacks may result in regulatory consequences reputational harm or financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers credit bureaus and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of their customers there have also been numerous highly publicized cases where hackers requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or to restore company access to locked systems we have incurred and may again incur expenses related to the investigation of cyberattacks involving thirdparty providers or related to the protection of our clients from identity theft as a result of such attacks we have also incurred and may continue to incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes to protect against cyber or other security incidents risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our clients to date key has not experienced material disruption of our operations or material harm to our client base as a result of the heightened threat landscape of cyberattacks as described in more

overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page of our form 10k should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance note basis of presentation and accounting policies of this report should also be reviewed for more information on accounting standards that have been adopted during the period in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions including accounting for the alll contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes derivatives and related hedging activities and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies in addition we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities a brief discussion of each of these areas appe ars on pages through of our form 10k during the three months ended march we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied

origination the guidance should be applied on a prospective basis except for amendments related to recognition and measurement of tdrs where a modified retrospective transition method is optional as part of the adoption of this guidance key elected to discontinue use of a discounted cash flow dcf methodology and apply its portfoliobased allowance approach to noncollateral dependent modified loans the adoption did not result in a material impact on keys financial condition or results of operations additionally disclosures for gross chargesoffs and loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty have been included in note asset quality the following are additional disclosures about our significant accounting policies updated in the first quarter of or impacted by the adoption of asu loans effective january we adopted the provisions of asu financial instruments credit losses topic which eliminated the accounting for troubled debt restructurings while expanding loan modification and vintage disclosure requirements under this guidance we assess all loan modifications to determine whether one is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty regardless of whether the modification loan terms include a concession modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form an interest rate reduction payment delay other modifications or some combination thereof a borrower is considered to be experiencing financial difficulty when there is significant doubt about the borrowers ability to make required payments on the loan or to get equivalent financing from another creditor at a market rate for a similar loan prior to the adoption of asu a tdr occurred when a loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty was restricted with a concession provided that a creditor would not otherwise consider nonperforming loans nonperforming loans are loans for which we do not accrue interest income and may include both commercial and consumer loans and leases modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and nonaccruing tdr loans prior to the adoption of asu nonperforming loans do not include loans held for sale once a loan is designated nonaccrual the interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income and payments subsequently received are applied to principal until qualifying for return to accrual allowance for loan and lease losses we estimate the alll using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the alll is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist our portfolio segments include commercial and consumer each of these two segments comprises multiple loan classes classes are characterized by similarities in initial measurement risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk the commercial segment is composed of commercial and industrial commercial real estate and commercial lease financing loan classes the consumer lending segment is composed of residential mortgage home equity consumer direct credit card student lending and consumer indirect loan classes the alll represents our current estimate of lifetime credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date in determining the alll we estimate expected future losses for the loans entire contractual term adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate the contractual term excludes expected extensions renewals and modifications the alll is the sum of three components i asset specific individual loan reserves ii quantitative formulaic or pooled reserves and iii qualitative judgmental reserves asset specific individual component loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective evaluation we have elected to apply the practical expedient to measure expected credit losses of a collateral dependent asset using the fair value of the collateral less any costs to sell when foreclosure is not probable when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty individual reserves are determined as follows for commercial nonaccruing loans greater than or equal to a defined dollar threshold individual reserves are determined based on an analysis of the present value of the loans expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell for commercial nonaccruing loans below the defined dollar threshold an established lgd percentage is multiplied by the loan balance and the results are aggregated for purposes of measuring specific reserve impairment the population of individually assessed consumer loans includes loans deemed collateral dependent these loans are written down based on the collaterals fair market value less costs to sell quantitative component we use a nondcf factorbased approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component pdlgdead models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller loan portfolios pd this component model is used to estimate the likelihood that a borrower will cease making payments as agreed the major contributors to this are the borrower credit attributes and macroeconomic trends the objective of the pd model is to produce default likelihood forecasts based on the observed loanlevel information and projected paths of macroeconomic variables lgd this component model is used to estimate the loss on a loan once a loan is in default ead estimates the loan balance at the time the borrower stops making payments for all term loans an amortization based formulaic approach is used for account level ead estimates we calculate ead using a portfolio specific method in each of our revolving product portfolios for line products that are unconditionally cancellable the balances will either use a paydown curve or be held flat through the life of the loan qualitative component the alll also includes identified qualitative factors related to idiosyncratic risk factors changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results and other relevant factors to ensure the alll reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses while our reserve methodologies strive to reflect all relevant risk factors there continues to be uncertainty associated with but not limited to potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between estimates and actual outcomes we provide additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks the alll also includes factors that may not be directly measured in the determination of individual or collective reserves such qualitative factors may include the nature and volume of the institutions financial assets the existence growth and effect of any concentrations of credit the volume and severity of past due financial assets the volume of nonaccrual assets and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded assets the value of the underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral dependent the institutions lending policies and procedures including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections writeoffs and recoveries the quality of the institutions credit review function the experience ability and depth of the institutions lending investment collection and other relevant management and staff the effect of other external factors such as the regulatory legal and technological environments competition and events such as natural disasters and actual and expected changes in international national regional and local economic and business conditions and developments in which the institution operates that affect the collectability of financial assets income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement asset and liability amounts and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax laws and rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized deferred tax assets are also recorded for any tax attributes such as tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards the net balance of deferred tax assets and liabilities is reported in accrued income and other assets or accrued expense and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as appropriate subsequent changes in the tax laws require adjustment to these assets and liabilities with the cumulative effect included in the provision for income taxes for the period in which the change is enacted a valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if based on the weight of available evidence it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized we use the proportional amortization method for lihtc investments whereby the associated investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to tax expense certain federal tax credits that are nonrefundable and transferable under applicable regulations are accounted for as government grants and recorded as a reduction to the amortized cost or net investment in the applicable asset generating the credit generally within accrued income and other assets or loans net of unearned income amounts are amortized through depreciation or as an adjustment to yield over the estimated life of the asset any gain or loss on the transfer of a tax credit is recorded within other income earnings per

expected credit losses we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated for all modeled loan portfolios we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables model inputs to their long run average we revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios a 20year fixed length look back period is used to calculate the long run average of the macroeconomic variables a four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period we develop our reasonable and supportable forecasts using relevant data including but not limited to changes in economic output unemployment rates property values and other factors associated with the credit losses on financial assets some macroeconomic variables apply to all portfolio segments while others are more portfolio specific the following table discloses key macroeconomic variables for each loan portfolio segment

include all transformations and interactions with other risk drivers additionally variables may have varying impacts at different points in the economic cycle in addition to macroeconomic drivers portfolio attributes such as remaining term outstanding balance risk ratings utilization fico ltv and delinquency also drive alll changes our alll models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes as such evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance economic outlook as of march risk of slowing economic growth is elevated due to the inflationary pressures and stress on financial markets unemployment rates are still expected to remain at relatively low levels but job growth is moderating inflation in the united states is starting to ease as the restrictive monetary policy and higher interest rates are making an impact asset prices including residential and commercial real estate values are expected to come under pressure we utilized the moodys february consensus forecast as our baseline forecast to estimate our expected credit losses as of march we determined such forecast to be a reasonable view of the outlook for the economy given all available information at quarter end the baseline scenario reflects slow economic growth over the next two years in markets in which we operate us gdp growth has slowed with the annualized rate contracting in the first quarter of and expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately and for and respectively the national unemployment rate forecast is in the first quarter of and is expected to increase through the fourth quarter of due to labor supply constraints the us consumer price index cpi annualized rate is expected to remain below over the national home price index is expected to decline approximately over as a result of the current economic uncertainty our future loss estimates may vary considerably from our march assumptions commercial loan portfolio the alll from continu ing operations for the commercial segment increased by million or from december the overall change in the commercial allowance is driven by changes in the economic outlook and loan growth changes to the economic forecast reflect lower economic growth projections in primarily related to high inflation and increased interest rates the reserve increase is concentrated in the commercial real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios reflecting the economic changes and more normalized portfolio conditions consumer loan portfolio the alll from continuing operations for the consumer segment increased by million or from december the overall increase in the allowance is primarily driven by economic forecast changes current reserve levels reflect the overall declining economic outlook quarteroverquarter with the most meaningful economic change being the slowing home price environment which is contributing to higher reserve levels for the residential mortgage portfolio deterioration in the unemployment outlook also impacted reserves for all consumer segments credit risk profile the prevalent risk characteristic for both commercial and consumer loans is the risk of loss arising from an obligors inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms evaluation of this risk is stratified and monitored by the loan risk rating grades assigned for the commercial loan portfolios and the refreshed fico score assigned for the consumer loan portfolios the internal risk grades assigned to loans follow our definitions of pass and criticized which are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on our rating scale for credits as minimal credit risk has been identified criticized loans are those loans that either have a potential weakness deserving managements close attention or have a welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk borrower fico scores provide information about the credit quality of our consumer loan portfolio as they provide an indication as to the likelihood that a debtor will repay its debts the scores are obtained from a nationally recognized consumer rating agency and are presented in the tables below at the dates indicated all extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by credit risk management and periodically reevaluated thereafter this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrowers management the borrowers competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk in the context of the general

disclosure requirements as part of our loss mitigation activities we may agree to modify the contractual terms of a loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty our loan modifications are

extension of maturity date interest rate reduction an other than insignificant payment delay other modifications or some combination thereof many factors can go into what is considered an other than insignificant payment delay such as the significance of the restricted payment amount relative to the normal loan payment or the relative significance of the delay to the original loan terms generally the bank considers any delay in payment of greater than days in the last months to be significant the alll for loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is determined based on keys alll policy as described within note basis of presentation and accounting policies modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty the banks strategy in working with commercial borrowers is to allow them time to improve their financial position through loan modification commercial borrowers that are rated substandard or worse in accordance with the regulatory definition or that cannot otherwise restructure at market terms and conditions are considered to be experiencing financial difficulty a modification of a loan is subject to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing the modified loan is evaluated to determine if it is a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan consumer loans in which a borrower requires a modification as a result of negative changes to their financial condition or to avoid default generally indicate the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty the primary modifications made to consumer loans are amortization maturity date and interest rate changes consumer borrowers identified as experiencing financial difficulty are generally unable to refinance their loans through the companys normal origination channel or through other independent sources the following table shows the amortized cost basis at the end of the reporting period of the loans modified
