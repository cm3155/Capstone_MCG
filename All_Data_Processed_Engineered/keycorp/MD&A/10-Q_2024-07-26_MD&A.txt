and recovery plans results of operations earnings overview the following chart provides a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders for the three months ended june to the three months ended june  in millions net interest income one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including the volume pricing mix and maturity of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities the volume and value of net free funds such as noninterestbearing deposits and equity capital the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace asset quality and fair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interestbearing liabilities to make it easier to compare both the results across several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present net interest income in this discussion on a te basis ie as if all income were taxable and at the same rate for example of taxexempt income would be presented as an amount that if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of would yield net interest income te was million for the second quarter of and the net interest margin was compared to the second quarter of net interest income te decreased million and net interest margin decreased by eight basis points both net interest income and the net interest margin benefited from the reinvestment of proceeds from maturing investment securities into higheryielding liquid investments and the maturity of loweryielding interest rate swaps with negative carry net interest income and the net interest margin declined year over year however reflecting lower loan balances in part driven by keys balance sheet optimization actions during and higher deposit costs in the higher interest rate environment relative to a year ago additionally the balance sheet experienced a shift in funding mix from noninterestbearing deposits to highercost deposits and borrowings for the six months ended june net interest income te decreased million from the same period last year and the net interest margin decreased by basis points net interest income te and the net interest margin benefited from higher earning asset yields as a result of the higher interest rate environment maturing interest rate swaps and the reinvestment of proceeds from maturing investment securities into higheryielding liquid investments however the decline in net interest income te and the net interest margin reflects lower loan balances in part driven by keys balance sheet optimization efforts during the second half of and higher deposit costs additionally the balance sheet

measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other noncovered positions we analyze market risk by portfolios and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type historical scenarios are customized for specific positions and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features such as options and cancellable provisions var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a confidence level for more information regarding our var model its governance and assumptions see market risk management on page of our form 10k actual losses for the total covered portfolios did not exceed aggregate daily var for any day during the quarter ended june and did not exceed aggregate daily

adequacy assessment our riskweighted assets include a market riskequivalent asset amount which consists of a var component stressed var component a de minimis exposure amount and a specific risk addon including the securitization positions the aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the market risk rule was million at june all of which were mortgagebacked security positions specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach market risk weighted assets including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule and approved by the chief market risk officer nontrading market risk most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk reprice risk is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interestbearing liabilities and the volume of interestearning assets they fund eg deposits used to fund loans do not mature or reprice at the same time basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floatingrate assets and floatingrate liabilities reprice at the same time but in response to different market factors or indexes yield curve risk is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity and occurs when interestbearing liabilities and the interestearning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterpartys ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets liabilities or offbalance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee the alco and the treasury risk oversight committee troc review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above in addition the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with managements desired interest rate risk positioning the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease from current levels over the next months subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero figure presents the results of the simulation analysis at june and june at june our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was relatively low the exposure to declining rates has changed from as of june to as of june as a result of the change in balance sheet mix and positioning tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual parallel basis point increase or basis point decrease in interest rates over the next months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than current modeled exposure is within board approved tolerances if a tolerance level is breached and determined inconsistent with risk appetite the development of a remediation plan is required to reduce exposure back to within tolerance figure simulated change in net interest income june june basis point change assumption assumed floor in market rates in basis points na na rising rate beta na high na mid tolerance level interest rate risk assessment nii at risk beta sensitivity june beta assumption high mid mid high interest rate risk assessment simulation analyses produce a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumption inputs within the model assumptions are tailored to the specific interest rate environment and validated on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analyses due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities or repercussions from exogenous events regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses are performed on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different yield curve shapes including steepening or flattening of the curve immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate changes and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts if fixed rate assets increase by billion or fixed rate liabilities decrease by billion then the potential benefit to declining rates would increase by approximately basis points a five percentage point increase or decrease in the interestbearing deposit beta assumption changes the current simulation results by approximately basis points the current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows corporate treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change the interest rate risk profile simulations are also conducted that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a similar manner to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures changes in the eve are calculated as discussed in the following section economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment eve policy limits are measured against a basis pointpolicy decline scenario the resulting rate in the policy decline scenario is equal to the greater of the current fed funds target and zero as of june the policy decline scenario is minus basis points this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as forward expectations remediation plans are similarly developed if the analysis indicates that the eve will decrease by or more in response to an instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates the position is within these guidelines as of june management of interest rate exposure the results of the various interest rate risk analyses are used to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically risk positions are managed by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives interest rate swaps and options are predominantly used which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities figure shows all swap positions held for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixedpay variable interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently to reflect broader alm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for more

is inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions governance structure we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on a consolidated basis this approach considers the funding sources available to each entity as well as each entitys capacity to manage through adverse conditions the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding the management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within corporate treasury oversight and governance is provided by the board the erm committee the alco the troc and the chief risk officer the asset liability management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the alco the corporate treasury oversight group within the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the federal reserve boards enhanced prudential standards these committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries liquidity trends peer comparisons variance analyses liquidity projections internal liquidity stress tests and goal tracking reports the reviews generate a discussion of positions trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions when liquidity pressure is elevated positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more frequent factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters global pandemics political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources for a discussion of certain risks which may impact our liquidity see part ii item risk factors in this report for more information on recent liquidity activity see the header our liquidity position and recent activity in this report below our credit ratings at june are shown in figure while we believe these credit ratings under normal conditions in the capital markets will enable keycorp or keybank to issue fixed income

at any time and lending them out in the form of illiquid loan assets the assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under stressed environments we manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite and within boardapproved policy limits we regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding in the normal course of business we perform a monthly internal stress test for both keycorp and keybank when we sense or detect emerging conditions that may strain liquidity we may conduct internal liquidity stress tests more frequently and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies internal liquidity stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods ultimately they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed our primary source of funding for keybank are customer deposits resulting in a consolidated loantodeposit ratio of as of june if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or onbalance sheet liquid reserves conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis as part of the plan we maintain onbalance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio which consists of high quality liquid assets during a problem period that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longerterm strategy figure shows our available contingent liquidity at june and december during the second quarter of our secured term borrowings were billion a decrease of million from the prior quarter figure available contingent liquidity dollars in billions june december available contingent liquidity unpledged securities net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account unused secured borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank of cleveland unused secured borrowing capacity at the fhlb total liquidity programs we have several liquidity programs which are described in note longterm debt beginning on page of our form 10k that are designed to enable keycorp and keybank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions these liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the board and are renewed and replaced as necessary there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs liquidity for keycorp the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences and fund capital distributions in the form of dividends and share buybacks we use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity the parent cash coverage months metric measures the number of months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current quantity of liquidity we generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from keybank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels keycorp the parent company generally maintains cash and shortterm investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next months at june keycorp held billion in cas h and shortterm investments which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance typicall y keycorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank supplemented with term debt federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval a national banks dividendpaying capacity is affected by several factors including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration keycorp did not issue any debt during the second quarter of during the second quarter of keybank paid million cash dividends to keycorp as of june keybank had regulatory capacity to pay billion in dividends to keycorp without prior regulatory approval our liquidity position and recent activity over the past quarter our liquid asset portfolio which includes overnight and shortterm investments as well as unencumbered high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios has increased primarily due to an increase in keys cash position the liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longerterm solution from time to time keycorp or keybank may seek to retire repurchase or exchange outstanding debt capital securities preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase privately negotiated transactions or other means additional information on repurchases of common

obligors inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit distribute credit risk purchase securities provide financial and payments products and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk credit policy approval and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the enterprise risk management committee the keybank board and the risk committee of the keycorp board for approval these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority are responsible for credit approval individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate however a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan scoring processes we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower allowance for loan and lease losses we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading allowance for loan and lease

malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities operational risk intersects with compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk while operational and compliance risk are separate risk disciplines in keycorps erm framework losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs are included in operational loss reporting and could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs or harm to our reputation we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk management program serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments both the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee include attendees from each of the three lines of defense primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance risk management functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance risk management programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the audit

performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page of our form 10k should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance note basis of presentation and accounting policies of this report should also be reviewed for more information on accounting standards that have been adopted during the period in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions including accounting for the alll contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes derivatives and related hedging activities and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies in addition we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities a brief discussion of each of these areas appe ars on pages through of our form 10k during the three months ended june we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates goodwill effective in the first quarter of we realigned our real estate capital business from our commercial bank reporting unit to our institutional bank reporting unit the move was done to align productbased teams to the clientfacing businesses they serve with the goal of reducing overhead and complexity and creating a better client experience this realignment was identified as a triggering event for purposes of goodwill impairment testing as a result interim goodwill impairment tests were performed during the first quarter of reflecting the reporting units both immediately before and immediately after the realignment neither of which resulted in impairment additionally goodwill was reallocated from our commercial bank reporting unit to our institutional bank reporting unit related to the realignment based on the relative fair value of the transferred business the results of the impairment test reflecting the realignment indicated the fair value of each of the three reporting units consumer commercial and institutional exceeded their respective carrying values by more than additionally we monitored events and circumstances through june including macroeconomic factors industry and banking sector events key specific performance indicators and the sensitivity of the interim quantitative test results to changes in assumptions through june at the conclusion of this assessment of all reporting units we determined that as of june it was more likely than not that the fair value of all

portfolio conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts in our estimation of expected credit losses we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated for all modeled loan portfolios we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables model inputs to their long run average we revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios a 20year fixed length look back period is used to calculate the long run average of the macroeconomic variables a four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period we develop our reasonable and supportable forecasts using relevant data including but not limited to changes in economic output unemployment rates property values and other factors associated with the credit losses on financial assets some macroeconomic variables apply to all portfolio segments while others are more portfolio specific the

operations unemployment rate a variables include all transformations and interactions with other risk drivers additionally variables may have varying impacts at different points in the economic cycle in addition to macroeconomic drivers portfolio attributes such as remaining term outstanding balance risk ratings utilization fico ltv and delinquency also drive alll changes our alll models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes as such evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance economic outlook as of june unemployment rates remain at relatively low levels but job growth is moderating inflation in the united states has eased as the restrictive monetary policy and a higher for longer interest rate environment has made an impact but inflation remains above the federal reserves target commercial real estate values remain under pressure with office being the most vulnerable asset class furthermore economic uncertainty remains elevated as geopolitical tensions the presidential election cycle and the timing of the federal reserves first rate cut are adding uncertainty into the forecast we utilized the moodys may consensus forecast as our baseline forecast to estimate our expected credit losses as of june we determined such forecast to be a reasonable view of the outlook for the economy given all available information at quarter end the baseline scenario reflects continued economic resiliency but weaknesses remain and the economy is forecasted to slow down in the second half of us gdp is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately and for and respectively down from in the expected national unemployment rate is expected to peak at in the fourth quarter of and remain at that level into mid2025 the forecast assumes the fed funds rate starts to decline in late but specific timing remains uncertain the us consumer price index annualized rate is forecasted at for the outlook for the national home price index has improved to reflect a growth through while the commercial real estate price index is forecasted to drop approximately by the end of to the extent we identified credit risk considerations that were not captured by the thirdparty economic forecast we addressed the risk through managements qualitative adjustments to the alll as a result of the current economic uncertainty our future loss estimates may vary considerably from our june assumptions commercial loan portfolio the alll from continuing operations for the commercial segment increased by million or fro m march the overall increase in the commercial allowance was driven by fluctuations in portfolio activity partly offset by economic changes and the impact of balance sheet optimization efforts the reserve levels continue to reflect portfolio migration considering the extended period of higher interest rates and the current inflationary environment the increase in reserves from the previous quarter is concentrated in the commercial and industrial portfolio reflecting downgrades and higher criticized levels the reserve increase was offset by continued economic resiliency consumer loan portfolio the alll from continuing operations for the consumer segment decreased by million or from march the overall decrease in the consumer allowance was driven by improvement in the economic forecast and the impact of balance sheet optimization efforts partly offset by credit quality normalization postpandemic reserve movements largely reflect favorable changes in the economic outlook quarteroverquarter for home prices credit risk profile the prevalent risk characteristic for both commercial and consumer loans is the risk of loss arising from an obligors inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms evaluation of this risk is stratified and monitored by the loan risk rating grades assigned for the commercial loan portfolios and the refreshed fico score assigned for the consumer loan portfolios the internal risk grades assigned to loans follow our definitions of pass and criticized which are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on our rating scale for credits as minimal credit risk has been identified criticized loans are those loans that either have a potential weakness deserving managements close attention or have a welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk borrower fico scores provide information about the credit quality of our consumer loan portfolio as they provide an indication as to the likelihood that a debtor will repay its debts the scores are obtained from a nationally recognized consumer rating agency and are presented in the tables below at the dates indicated most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by credit risk management and periodically reevaluated thereafter this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrowers management the borrowers competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk in the context of the general economic outlook types of exposure transaction structure and collateral including credit

financial position through loan modification commercial borrowers that are rated substandard or worse in accordance with the regulatory definition or that cannot otherwise restructure at market terms and conditions are considered to be experiencing financial difficulty a modification of a loan is subject to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing the modified loan is evaluated to determine if it is a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan consumer loans in which a borrower requires a modification as a result of negative changes to their financial condition or to avoid default generally indicate the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty the primary modifications made to consumer loans are amortization maturity date and interest rate changes consumer borrowers identified as experiencing financial difficulty are generally unable to refinance their loans through our normal origination channel or through other

transactions of the same issuer for equity investments eligible for the cost less impairment measurement alternative these adjustments are included in other income on the income statement c fair values of heldtomaturity securities are determined by using models that are based on securityspecific details as well as relevant industry and economic factors the most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securities and certain prepayment assumptions we review the valuations derived from the models to ensure that they are reasonable and consistent with the values placed on similar securities traded in the secondary markets d the fair value of loans is based on the present value of the expected cash flows the projected cash flows are based on the contractual terms of the loans adjusted for prepayments and use of a discount rate based on the relative risk of the cash flows taking into account the loan type maturity of the loan liquidity risk servicing costs and a required return on debt and capital in addition an incremental liquidity discount is applied to certain loans using historical sales of loans during periods of
