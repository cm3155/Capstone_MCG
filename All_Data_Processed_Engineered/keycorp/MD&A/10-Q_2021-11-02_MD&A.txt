specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach market risk weighted assets including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule and approved by the chief market risk officer nontrading market risk most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk reprice risk is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interestbearing liabilities and the volume of interestearning assets they fund eg deposits used to fund loans do not mature or reprice at the same time basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floatingrate assets and floatingrate liabilities reprice at the same time but in response to different market factors or indexes yield curve risk is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity and occurs when interestbearing liabilities and the interestearning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterpartys ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets liabilities or offbalance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above in addition the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk these committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight libor transition as disclosed in item risk factors of our form 10k libor in its current form will generally not be available after for new contracts and the libor administrator will cease publishing all us libor tenors entirely after june for most products the most likely replacement benchmark is expected to be sofr which has been recommended by the arrc although uncertainty remains as to whether new benchmarks may evolve and a different credit sensitive benchmark could instead become the marketaccepted benchmark the federal reserve and the occ have encouraged financial institutions not to wait for the end of to make the transition away from libor we have established an enterprise wide program to identify and address all libor transition issues we are collaborating closely with regulators and industry groups on the transition and closely monitoring developments in industry practices related to libor alternatives the goals of our libor transition program are to identify and analyze liborbased exposure and develop and execute transition strategies review and update nearterm strategies and actions for our liborbased business currently being written assess financial impact and risk while planning and executing mitigation actions understand and strategically address the current market approach to libor and sofr determine and execute system and process work to be operationally ready for sofr or additional credit sensitive benchmarks and originate new loans using sofr as part of the libor transition program we completed an initial risk assessment to help us identify the impact and risks associated with various products systems processes and models this risk assessment has assisted us in making necessary updates to our infrastructure and operational systems and processes to implement a replacement rate and we are progressing on schedule to be operationally ready for various sofrbased benchmarks including but not limited to daily simple sofr in arrears sofr compounded in arrears sofr averages in advance and term sofr we have begun to quote alternative indexes other than libor such as sofr and term sofr and have begun to originate new loans in those indexes we have also begun to originate a small number of new loans using credit sensitive rates we have compiled an inventory of existing legal contracts that are impacted by the libor transition we are assessing the libor fallback language in those contracts and are devising a strategy to address the libor transition for those contracts we have also focused on refining libor fallback language in new legal contracts including requiring the use of robust fallback language our progress is wellpaced especially as many of the legacy contracts will be provided additional time to remediate due to announcements by the ice benchmark administration the fcaregulated and authorized administrator of libor that certain libor tenors may continue until june for legacy contract purposes in addition we are on schedule with our work to address contracts with libor tenors that must transition by the end of we expect to leverage recommendations made by the arrc and isda that are tailored to our specific client segments net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with managements desired interest rate risk positioning the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease from current levels over the next months subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero figure presents the results of the simulation analysis at september and september at september our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was moderate the exposure to declining rates has increased from september as a result of higher starting rate levels and a larger balance sheet compared to the september analysis exposure to declining rates remains moderate given the relative low level of actual market rates and the hedging and investing strategies employed tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual parallel basis point increase or basis point decrease in interest rates over the next months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than current modeled exposure is within board approved tolerances figure simulated change in net interest income september september basis point change assumption assumed floor in market rates in basis points na na tolerance level interest rate risk assessment simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model we tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including steepening or flattening of the yield curve immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate changes and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts if fixed rate assets increase by billion or fixed rate liabilities decrease by billion then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately basis points if the interestbearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by eg to then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately basis points our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows corporate treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment the interest rate shock scenarios are equal to the current fed target rate capped at basis points in the current low rate environment the declining shock scenario is reduced with a basis point minimum this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of september management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives we predominantly use interest rate swaps and options which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities figure shows all swap positions that we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixedpay variable interest rate swap

inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters global pandemics including covid19 political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources see part i item risk factors section iv liquidity risk in our form 10k for a discussion of how

million as additional advances were taken if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances we rely on wholesale funding or onbalance sheet liquid reserves conversely excess cash generated by operating investing and depositgathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets liquidity for keycorp the primary source of liquidity for keycorp is from subsidiary dividends primarily from keybank keycorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences

loss arising from an obligors inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms like other financial services institutions we make loans extend credit purchase securities provide financial and payments products and enter into financial derivative contracts all of which have related credit risk credit policy approval and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program the credit risk committee approves management credit policies and recommends significant credit policies to the enterprise risk management committee the keybank board and the risk committee of the board for approval these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit as a result of the current economic environment our commercial loan portfolio is going through active portfolio surveillance which is described in more detail in the section entitled loans and loans held for sale commercial loan portfolio our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority are responsible for credit approval individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate however a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans these models known as scorecards forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system which allows for realtime scoring and automated decisions for many of our products we periodically validate the loan scoring processes we maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios for individual obligors we employ a sliding scale of exposure known as hold limits which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower allowance for loan and lease losses we estimate the appropriate level of the alll on at least a quarterly basis the methodology used is described in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses beginning on page of our form 10k briefly the alll estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on our historical loss experience current borrower characteristics current conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant factors as described in note summary of significant accounting policies of our form 10k on january we adopted

risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities operational risk intersects with compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards this includes our compliance with lending programs established by the cares act including the ppp and main street lending program under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk while operational and compliance risk are separate risk disciplines in keys erm framework losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs are included in operational loss reporting and could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key the compliance risk management program serves the same function in managing compliance risk for key the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee support the erm committee by identifying early warning events and trends escalating emerging risks and discussing forwardlooking assessments both the operational risk committee and the compliance risk committee include attendees from each of the three lines of defense primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business the operational risk committee and compliance risk committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities these committees and the operational risk management and compliance risk management functions are an integral part of our erm program our risk review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management and compliance risk management programs and our system of internal controls risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the risk and audit committees and independently supports the risk committees oversight of these controls cybersecurity we maintain comprehensive cyber incident response plans and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets against attempts to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems shut down access to systems for ransom or cause other damage as the threat landscape continues to evolve critical infrastructure including financial services remains a top target for cyberattacks covid19 has created a unique situation globally with many more employees and thirdparty service providers working from home which inherently introduces additional risk cyberattacks may include but are not limited to attacks that are intended to disrupt or disable banking services and prevent banking transactions attempts to breach the security of systems and data and social engineering attempts aimed at tricking employees and clients into providing sensitive information or executing financial transactions cyberattack risks may also occur with our thirdparty technology service providers and may result in financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations cyberattacks could also interfere with thirdparty providers ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us recent highprofile cyberattacks have targeted retailers credit bureaus and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information including personal financial and credit card information of their customers recently there have also been numerous highly publicized cases where hackers requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or to restore company access to locked systems we may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks we may also incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes to protect against cyber or other security incidents risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by us and our clients to date key has not experienced material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers as a result of the heightened threat landscape or cyberattacks as described in more

committee reviews and provides oversight of managements activities related to the enterprisewide risk management framework including cyberrelated risk the erm committee chaired by the chief executive

believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing keys capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock since analysts and banking regulators may

reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page of our form 10k should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance note basis of presentation and accounting policies of this report should also be reviewed for more information on accounting standards that have been adopted during the period in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions including accounting for the alll contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes derivatives and related hedging activities and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies in addition we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities a brief discussion of each of these areas appe ars on pages through of our form 10k during the first nine months of we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates accounting and reporting developments accounting guidance pending adoption at september standard required adoption description effect on financial statements or other significant matters asu debtdebt with conversion and other options subtopic and derivatives and hedging contracts in entitys own equity subtopic january early adoption is permitted the asu simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments by eliminating the legacy accounting models for convertible instruments with beneficial conversion features or cash conversion features the guidance also amends the guidance used to determine if a freestanding financial instrument or an embedded feature qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting for freestanding financial instruments and embedded features that have all the characteristics of a derivative instrument and are potentially settled in an entitys own stock the guidance simplifies the settlement assessment that entities are required to perform also the update now requires the use of the ifconverted method for all convertible instruments and includes the effect of potential share settlement in diluted eps if the effect is more dilutive the new guidance also makes clarifications to the eps calculation further the asu expands disclosure requirements the guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective or retrospective basis the adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations reference rate reform topic december london interbank offered rate libor a reference rate presumed to capture bank funding costs is being phased out and will no longer be published this transition to alternate rates will impact among other things contracts that reference libor this

reasonable and supportable forecasts in our estimation of expected credit losses we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated for all modeled loan portfolios we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables model inputs to their long run average we revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios a year fixed length look back period is used to calculate the long run average of the macroeconomic variables a four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period we develop our reasonable and supportable forecasts using relevant data including but not limited to changes in economic output unemployment rates property values and other factors associated with the credit losses on financial assets some macroeconomic variables apply to all portfolio segments while others are more portfolio specific the following table discloses

operations unemployment rate a variables include all transformations and interactions with other risk drivers additionally variables may have varying impacts at different points in the economic cycle in addition to macroeconomic drivers portfolio attributes such as remaining term outstanding balance risk ratings fico ltv and delinquency also drive alll changes our alll models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes as such evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance economic outlook as of september the economic outlook continues to be strong but the emergence of the delta variant of the covid19 virus negatively impacted supply chains and consumer confidence we utilized the moodys august consensus forecast as our baseline forecast to estimate our expected credit losses as of september we determined such forecast to be a reasonable view of the outlook for the economy given all available information at quarter end the baseline scenario continues to reflect moderate economic growth over the next two years in markets in which we operate us gdp continues to increase at an annualized rate in the third quarter of and at an annual rate of approximately and for and respectively the national unemployment rate forecast is in the third quarter of and is expected to decline to by the fourth quarter of and by the fourth quarter of to the extent we identified credit risk considerations that were not captured by the thirdparty economic forecast we addressed the risk through managements qualitative adjustments to the alll as a result of the unprecedented economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic our future loss estimates may vary considerably from our september assumptions commercial loan portfolio the alll from continuing operations for the commercial segment decreased by million or from june the overall decrease in the allowance is driven by improvements in economic forecasts and asset quality partially offset by loan growth the changes to the economic forecast primarily reflect improvements in economic drivers used in our models the favorable unemployment and gdp outlook contributes to the overall commercial segment reserve decrease expected improvements in real estate price indices lead to a reduction in reserve for our commercial real estate book positive risk rating migrations are driving a modest decrease in alll levels for the commercial and industrial portfolio the alll results also reflect incremental credit risk considerations as a result of the future economic uncertainties which are addressed through qualitative adjustments as of september we concluded that no alll is necessary for billion in outstanding ppp loans as they are guaranteed by the sba consumer loan portfolio the alll from continuing operations for the consumer segment decreased by million or from june the overall decrease in the allowance is driven by updated economic forecasts that capture an im proving outlook for several drivers and strong portfolio performance partially offset by growth in consumer real estate the most meaningful changes to the economic forecast contributing to the reduction in reserves include improvement in the unemployment rate outlook which impacts all consumer portfolios in addition the housing market and home price index outlook continue to display strength which impacts the residential mortgage and home equity segments as it relates to the decline in the alll due to portfolio factors shifts are largely driven by attrition activity targeted portfolio growth and overall strong credit drivers the alll results also reflect incremental credit risk considerations as a result of the economic uncertainty and related borrower assistance programs which are addressed through qualitative adjustments credit risk profile the prevalent risk characteristic for both commercial and consumer loans is the risk of loss arising from an obligors inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms evaluation of this risk is stratified and monitored by the loan risk rating grades assigned for the commercial loan portfolios and the refreshed fico score assigned for the consumer loan portfolios the internal risk grades assigned to loans follow our definitions of pass and criticized which are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on our rating scale for problem credits as minimal credit risk has been identified criticized loans are those loans that either have a potential weakness deserving managements close attention or have a welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk borrower fico scores provide information about the credit quality of our consumer loan portfolio as they provide an indication as to the likelihood that a debtor will repay its debts the scores are obtained from a nationally recognized consumer rating agency and are presented in the tables below at the dates indicated most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by credit risk management and periodically reevaluated thereafter this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrowers management the borrowers competitive position within its industry sector and our view of industry risk in the context of the general economic outlook types of exposure
