interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loanrelated fee income and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings there are several factors that affect net interest income including the volume pricing mix and maturity of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities the volume and value of net free funds such as noninterestbearing deposits and equity capital the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace asset quality and fair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interestbearing liabilities to make it easier to compare both the results across several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable some not we present

var var is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level stressed var is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios the mrm calculates var and stressed var on a daily basis and the results are distributed to appropriate management var and stressed var results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations we use a historical simulation var model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other noncovered positions we analyze market risk by portfolios and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type var is calculated using daily observations over a oneyear time horizon and approximates a confidence level statistically this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than var on average five out of trading days or three to four times each quarter we also calculate var and stressed var at a confidence level for more information

results at the confidence level to daily held profit and loss results of backtesting are provided to the mrc backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed var we do not engage in correlation trading or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk our net var approach incorporates diversification but our var calculation does not include the impact of

changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach market risk weighted assets including the specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the mrm in accordance with the market risk rule and approved by the chief market risk officer nontrading market risk most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products as well as investments hedging relationships longterm debt and certain shortterm borrowings interest rate risk which is inherent in the banking industry is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve that result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of assets and liabilities we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the board approved erm policy interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products economic conditions the competitive environment within our markets changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging investing funding and capital positions the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk basis risk yield curve risk and option risk table of contents reprice risk is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interestbearing liabilities and the volume of interestearning assets they fund eg deposits used to fund loans do not mature or reprice at the same time basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indices and occurs when floatingrate assets and floatingrate liabilities reprice at the same time but in response to different market factors or indexes yield curve risk is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity and occurs when interestbearing liabilities and the interestearning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterpartys ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets liabilities or offbalance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation the management of nontrading market risk is centralized within corporate treasury the risk committee of our board provides oversight of nontrading market risk the erm committee and the alco review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above in addition the alco reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk the erm committee and the alco have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk including recommending approving and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges the alm policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the alco the mrm as the second line of defense provides additional oversight libor transition as disclosed in item risk factors of our form 10k libor in its current form is not expected to be available after the most likely replacement rate is expected to be sofr which has been recommended by the arrc the federal reserve has encouraged financial institutions not to wait for the end of to make the transition away from libor we have established an enterprise wide program to identify and address all libor transition issues we are collaborating closely with regulators and industry groups on the transition and closely monitoring developments in industry practices related to libor alternatives the goals of our libor transition program are to identify and analyze liborbased exposure and develop and execute transition strategies review and update nearterm strategies and actions for our current liborbased business currently being written assess financial impact and risk while planning and executing mitigation actions understand and strategically address the current market approach to libor and sofr and determine and execute system and process work to be operationally ready for sofr as part of the libor transition program we completed an initial risk assessment to help us identify the impact and risks associated with various products systems processes and models this risk assessment has assisted us in making necessary updates to our infrastructure and operational systems and processes to implement a replacement rate and we anticipate being operationally ready for sofr in the fourth quarter of we have compiled an inventory of existing legal contracts that are impacted by the libor transition we are assessing the libor fallback language in those contracts and are devising a strategy to address the libor transition for those contracts we have also focused on refining libor fallback language in new legal contracts we expect to leverage recommendations made by the arrc and isda that are tailored to our specific client segments net interest income simulation analysis the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis for purposes of this analysis we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and offbalance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view the modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with managements desired interest rate risk positioning the simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if rates were to gradually increase or decrease from current levels over the next months subject to a floor on market interest rates at zero table of contents figure presents the results of the simulation analysis at september and september at september our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modest exposure to declining rates remains nominal given the low level of market rates in comparison to the floor utilized in the scenario exposure to rising rates has changed from a detriment in to a benefit currently as the lower actual market rates reduce the need for additional modeled hedges and lower the projected beta to rising rates tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual parallel basis point increase or basis point decrease in interest rates over the next months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than current modeled exposure is within board approved tolerances figure simulated change in net interest income september september basis point change assumption shortterm rates assumed floor in market rates in basis points na na tolerance level interest rate risk assessment simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model we tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled and validate those assumptions on a regular basis however actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition customer behavior product pricing market interest rates changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning investment funding and hedging activities and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve including steepening or flattening of the yield curve immediate changes in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions loan and deposit balances the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities changes in lending spreads prepayments on loans and securities investment funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies the results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in figure net interest income is highly dependent on the timing magnitude frequency and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts if fixed rate assets increase by billion or fixed rate liabilities decrease by billion then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately basis points if the interestbearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by eg to then the benefit to rising rates would decrease or increase by approximately basis points our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume mix maturity and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows corporate treasury discretionary activities related to funding investing and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows or changes in managements desired interest rate risk positioning as changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a threeyear horizon these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12month horizon to capture longerterm exposures we calculate exposures to changes of the eve as discussed in the following section economic value of equity modeling eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond and 36month horizons eve modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate basis point increase or decrease in interest rates measuring the resulting change in the values of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities those assumptions table of contents are based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates we are operating within these guidelines as of september management of interest rate exposure we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate alm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures specifically we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates and using derivatives we predominantly use interest rate swaps and options which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities figure shows all swap positions that we hold for alm purposes these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index for example fixedrate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixedpay variable interest rate swap the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change

inherent in the banking industry is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals meet contractual obligations and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost in a timely manner and without adverse consequences liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war natural disasters global pandemics including covid19 political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or

to operational risk which is the risk of loss resulting from human error or malfeasance inadequate or failed internal processes and systems and external events these events include among other things threats to our cybersecurity as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities operational risk also encompasses compliance risk which is the risk of loss from violations of or noncompliance with laws rules and regulations prescribed practices and ethical standards this includes our compliance with lending programs established by the cares act including the ppp and main street lending program under the doddfrank act large financial companies like key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation this heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk resulting operational risk losses andor additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges increased operational costs harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance and a system of internal controls and reporting we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations for example an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board the operational risk management program provides the framework for the structure governance roles and responsibilities as well as the

nongaap critical accounting policies and estimates our business is dynamic and complex consequently we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies these choices are critical not only are they necessary to comply with gaap they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance all accounting policies are important and all policies described in note summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page of our form 10k should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance note basis of presentation and accounting policies of this report should also be reviewed for more information on accounting standards that have been adopted during the period in our opinion some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances they may prove to be inaccurate or we may find it necessary to change them we rely heavily on the use of judgment assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions including accounting for the alll contingent liabilities guarantees and income taxes derivatives and related hedging activities and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies in addition we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities a brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages through of our form 10k during the first nine months of we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates except for our alll as a result of the adoption of asc on january in conjunction with the adoption of asc the critical accounting policy and estimate disclosure for our alll was updated from what was disclosed in our form 10k the accounting policy for goodwill was also updated due to the adoption of asu intangibles goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment these updates are as follows allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loans and leases represents managements estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our existing loan portfolio determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain these critical estimates include significant use of our own historical data and complex methods to interpret them we have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality quantity and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances these evaluations are inherently subjective as they require material estimates and may be susceptible to significant change and include among others pd lgd outstanding balance of the loan movement through delinquency stages table of contents amounts and timing of expected future cash flows value of collateral which may be obtained from third parties economic forecasts which are obtained from a third party provider and qualitative factors such as changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in modeled results as described in our accounting policy related to the alll in note basis of presentation and accounting policies of this report under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses we employ a disciplined process and methodology to establish our alll which has three main components i asset specific individual loan reserves ii quantitative formulaic or pooled reserves and iii qualitative judgmental reserves we use a nondcf factorbased approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component pdlgdead models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller loan portfolios probability of default models estimate the likelihood a borrower will cease making payments as agreed these models use observed loanlevel information and projected paths of macroeconomic variables borrower credit attributes including fico scores of consumers and internally assigned risk ratings for commercial borrowers are significant inputs to the models consumer fico scores are refreshed quarterly and commercial risk ratings are updated annually with select borrowers updated more frequently the macroeconomic trends that have a significant impact on the probability of default vary by portfolio segment exposure at default models estimate the loan balance at the time the borrower stops making payments we use an amortization based formulaic approach to estimate account level ead for all term loans we use portfolio specific methods in each of our revolving product portfolios lgd models estimate the loss we will suffer once a loan is in default account level inputs to lgd models include collateral attributes such as loan to value if we observe limitations in the data or models we use model overlays to make adjustments to model outputs to capture a particular risk or compensate for a known limitation these variables and others may result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts this estimate produced by our models is forwardlooking and requires management to use forecasts about future economic conditions to determine the expected credit loss over the remaining life of an instrument moodys consensus forecast is the source of macroeconomic projections including the interest rate forecasts used in the credit models we use a two year reasonable and supportable period across all products to forecast economic conditions as the length of the life of a financial asset increases these inputs may become impractical to estimate as reasonable and supportable we believe the two year time horizon appropriately aligns with our business planning available industry guidance and reliability of various forecasting services following this two year period in which supportable forecasts can be generated for all modeled loan portfolios we revert expected credit losses to a level that is consistent with our historical information by reverting the macroeconomic variables model inputs to their long run average we revert to historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios a four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period we use a year lookback period for determining long run historical average of the macroeconomic variables we determined the year lookback period is appropriate as it captures the previous two economic cycles including the last downturn and our more recent positive credit experience the alll is sensitive to various macroeconomic drivers such as gdp and unemployment as well as portfolio attributes such as remaining term outstanding balance risk ratings fico ltv and delinquency status our alll models were designed to capture the correlation between economic and portfolio changes as such evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall alll because we consider a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the alll changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and input may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others however to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast we compared the modeled quantitative allowance results using a downside economic scenario the maximum difference in the quarterly macroeconomic variables between the base and downside scenarios over the two year reasonable and supportable period includes an approximate decline in gdp annualized growth and an approximate increase in the us table of contents unemployment rate the difference between these two scenarios would have driven an increase of approximately for commercial and for the consumer modeled allowance results similarly deteriorating conditions for portfolio factors were also considered by moderately stressing key portfolio drivers relative to the baseline portfolio conditions stressing risk ratings by two grades for commercial loans generates a increase in the commercial modeled allowance results stressing fico by ten points and ltv and utilization by for consumer loans generates a increase in the consumer modeled allowance results note that these analyses demonstrate the sensitivity of the alll to key quantitative assumptions however they are not intended to estimate changes in the overall alll as they do not reflect qualitative factors related to idiosyncratic risk factors changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results and other relevant factors that must be considered to ensure the alll reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses with the unprecedented economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic future alll results may vary considerably based on the actual magnitude of the pandemic and impact of the united states monetary and fiscal response goodwill goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination goodwill is tested for impairment for all three of our reporting units consumer bank commercial bank and institutional bank we perform our annual impairment test as of october 1st and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing is needed effective january we adopted asu intangibles goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment eliminating the second step of goodwill impairment testing under the new guidance if the fair value of a reporting unit declines below its carrying value an impairment charge will be recognized for any amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting units fair value to the extent that the loss recognized does not exceed the amount of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the adoption of asu did not impact our current financial condition or results of operations in consideration of the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and industry and market conditions due to the covid19 pandemic during the third quarter of we identified a triggering event impairment indicators considered comprised economic conditions including projections of the duration of current conditions and timing of a potential recovery industry and market considerations government intervention and regulatory updates the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting units performance of our stock and other relevant events after considering the triggering event together with other relevant factors we performed an interim quantitative test at each reporting unit we concluded goodwill was not impaired at september for more information see note goodwill table of contents accounting and reporting developments accounting guidance pending adoption at september standard required adoption description effect on financial statements or other significant matters asu simplifying the accounting for

incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a yeartodate loss exceeds the anticipated loss and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment and when a foreign equity method investment becomes a subsidiary along with general improvements it adds simplifications related to franchise taxes the tax basis of goodwill and the method for recognizing an enacted change in tax laws the guidance also specifies that an entity is not required to allocate the consolidated amount of certain tax expense to a legal entity not subject to tax in its own separate financial statements the guidance should be applied on either a retrospective modified

accounting guidance adopted in measurement of credit losses on financial instruments asu asu asu asu asu asu asu on january we adopted asu financial instruments credit losses asc measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which replaces the incurredloss methodology that recognized losses when a probable threshold was met with an expectedloss methodology specifically recognizing current expected credit losses cecl for the remaining life of the asset at the time of origination or acquisition the cecl methodology applies to loans debt securities and other financial assets and net investment in leases measured at amortized cost it also applies to offbalance sheet credit exposures loan commitments standby letters of credit financial guarantees and other similar instruments assets in the scope of asc are presented at the net amount expected to be collected after deducting the allowance for credit losses from the amortized cost basis of the assets asc also requires credit losses relating to availableforsale debt securities that management does not intend to sell or believes that it is more likely than not they will be required to sell to be recorded through an allowance rather than a reduction of the carrying amount asc replaces the purchased credit impaired concept of accounting previously required under subtopic with a purchased financial assets with credit deterioration pcd concept in accordance with asc we did not reassess whether recognized purchased credit impaired loans met the criteria of a pcd loan and modifications to individual acquired loans accounted for in pools were tdrs as of the date of adoption at adoption we elected to not maintain the pools of loans previously accounted for under subtopic table of contents the prospective application resulted in a million adjustment to the amortized cost basis of pcd loans to reflect the addition to the allowance for loans and leases as of january after the adjustment for the allowance for the loans and leases the noncredit discount of million will be accreted to interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment from credit losses as of january the asu requires use of a modified retrospective approach through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption results for reporting periods beginning after january are presented under asc while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable gaap we posted an adjusting entry decreasing retained earnings as of january by million net of deferred taxes of million for the cumulative effect of adopting asc the main drivers of the adjustment to retained earnings are summarized in the following table preasc adoption impact of asc adoption as reported under asc in millions december january allowance for credit losses commercial commercial and industrial real estate commercial

loans total consumer loans total alll continuing operations discontinued operations total alll accrued expense and other liabilities total allowance for credit losses in conjunction with the adoption of asc the following are additional disclosures about our significant accounting policies related to cecl allowance for heldtomaturity securities debt securities that we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as heldtomaturity and are carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the interest method this method produces a constant rate of return on the adjusted carrying amount management classifies the heldtomaturity portfolio into the following major security types agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations agency residential mortgagebacked securities agency commercial mortgagebacked securities asset backed securities and other management measures expected credit losses on heldtomaturity securities on a collective basis by major security type the estimate of expected losses considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts we do not measure expected credit losses on heldtomaturity securities in which historical credit loss information adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts results in an expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero all of our mortgagebacked securities are issued by us governmentsponsored enterprises or gnma are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses other securities are comprised of state of israel bonds denominated and paid in us dollars israel bonds have a long history of no credit losses additionally as of september the state of israels credit rating remains stable among fitch moodys and sp a a1 aa table of contents allowance for availableforsale securities debt securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time but that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates prepayment risk liquidity needs or other factors are classified as availableforsale and reported at fair value realized gains and losses resulting from sales of securities using the specific identification method are included in other income on the income statement unrealized gains and losses net of income taxes are recorded in equity as a component of aoci for availableforsale securities in an unrealized loss position we first assess whether we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis if either of these criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met the securitys amortized cost basis is written down to fair value in other income on the income statement for debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors in making this assessment management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost nature of the security the underlying collateral and the financial condition of the issuer among other factors if this assessment indicates a credit loss exists the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis a credit loss exists and an allowance for availableforsale securities is recorded for the credit loss limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for availableforsale securities is recognized in other comprehensive income changes in the allowance for availableforsale securities are recorded as provision for or reversal of credit loss losses are charged against the allowance for availableforsale securities when management believes the uncollectibility of an availableforsale security is confirmed or when either criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met loans accrued interest on loans is included in other assets on the balance sheet and is excluded from the calculation of the allowance for credit losses due to our chargeoff policy to reverse accrued interest on nonperforming loans against interest income in a timely manner we have not classified loans that receive a payment deferral or forbearance under a covid19 hardship relief program as nonperforming loans and continue to accrue and recognize interest income during the period of the deferral we therefore recognize an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivable amounts that result from deferred payments under a covid19 hardship relief program because those amounts would not be considered to be written off in a timely manner as of september the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable was immaterial expected credit losses on net investments in leases including any unguaranteed residual asset are included in the alll purchased credit deteriorated pcd loans in addition to originating loans we also acquire loans through portfolio purchases or acquisitions of other financial services companies purchased loans that have evidence of more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are deemed pcd loans in accordance with asc we did not reassess whether recognized purchased credit impaired loans met the criteria of a pcd loan as of the date of adoption pcd loans are initially recorded at fair value along with an allowance for credit losses determined using the same methodology as originated loans the sum of the loans purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis the difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision for credit losses nonperforming loans nonperforming loans are loans for which we do not accrue interest income and include commercial and consumer loans and leases as well as current year tdrs and nonaccruing tdr loans from prior years nonperforming loans do not include loans held for sale once a loan is designated nonaccrual the interest accrued but not collected is table of contents reversed against interest income and payments subsequently received are applied to principal until qualifying for return to accrual allowance for loan and lease losses we estimate the alll using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the alll is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist our portfolio segments include commercial and consumer each of these two segments comprises multiple loan classes classes are characterized by similarities in initial measurement risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk the commercial segment is composed of commercial and industrial commercial real estate and commercial lease financing loan classes the consumer lending segment is composed of residential mortgage home equity consumer direct credit card and consumer indirect loan classes the alll represents our current estimate of lifetime credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date in determining the alll we estimate expected future losses for the loans entire contractual term adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate the contractual term excludes expected extensions renewals and modifications the alll is the sum of three components i asset specific individual loan reserves ii quantitative formulaic or pooled reserves and iii qualitative judgmental reserves asset specific individual component loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective evaluation we have elected to apply the practical expedient to measure expected credit losses of a collateral dependent asset using the fair value of the collateral less any costs to sell when foreclosure is not probable when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty individual reserves are determined as follows for commercial nonaccruing loans greater than or equal to a defined dollar threshold individual reserves are determined based on an analysis of the present value of the loans expected future cash flows the loans observable market value or the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell for commercial nonaccruing loans below the defined dollar threshold an established lgd percentage is multiplied by the loan balance and the results are aggregated for purposes of measuring specific reserve impairment the population of individually assessed consumer loans includes loans deemed collateral dependent in addition to all tdrs the expected loss for these loans is estimated based on the present value of the loans expected future cash flows except in instances where the loan is collateral dependent in which case the loan is written down based on the collaterals fair market value less costs to sell quantitative component we use a nondcf factorbased approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component pdlgdead models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller loan portfolios pd this component model is used to estimate the likelihood that a borrower will cease making payments as agreed the major contributors to this are the borrower credit attributes and macroeconomic trends the objective of the pd model is to produce default likelihood forecasts based on the observed loanlevel information and projected paths of macroeconomic variables lgd this component model is used to estimate the loss on a loan once a loan is in default ead estimates the loan balance at the time the borrower stops making payments for all term loans an amortization based formulaic approach is used for account level ead estimates we calculate ead using a portfolio specific method in each of our revolving product portfolios for line products that are unconditionally cancellable the balances will either use a paydown curve or be held flat through the life of the loan additional information about the critical estimates and judgments we make in developing these models is provided in the section allowance for loan and lease losses under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates in item of this report table of contents qualitative component the alll also includes identified qualitative factors related to idiosyncratic risk factors changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results and other relevant factors to ensure the alll reflects our best estimate of current expected credit losses while our reserve methodologies strive to reflect all relevant risk factors there continues to be uncertainty associated with but not limited to potential imprecision in the estimation process due to the inherent time lag of obtaining information and normal variations between estimates and actual outcomes we provide additional reserves that are designed to provide coverage for losses attributable to such risks the alll also includes factors that may not be directly measured in the determination of individual or collective reserves such qualitative factors may include the nature and volume of the institutions financial assets the existence growth and effect of any concentrations of credit the volume and severity of past due financial assets the volume of nonaccrual assets and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded assets the value of the underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral dependent the institutions lending policies and procedures including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections writeoffs and recoveries the quality of the institutions credit review function the experience ability and depth of the institutions lending investment collection and other relevant management and staff the effect of other external factors such as the regulatory legal and technological environments competition and events such as natural disasters and actual and expected changes in international national regional and local economic and business conditions and developments in which the institution operates that affect the collectability of financial assets liability for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the liability for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments such as letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments is included in accrued expense and other liabilities on the balance sheet expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual period in which we are exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by us the liability for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments is adjusted as a provision for credit losses the estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated useful life consistent with our estimation process on our loan and lease portfolio we use a nondcf factorbased approach to estimate expected credit losses that include component pdlgdead models as well as less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios allowance for credit losses on other financial assets the allowance for credit losses on other financial assets such as other receivables and servicing advances is determined based on historical loss information and other available indicators if such information does not indicate any expected credit losses key may estimate the allowance for credit losses on other financial assets to be zero or close to zero as of september the allowance for credit losses on other financial assets was immaterial simplifying the test for goodwill impairment asu on january we adopted asu the asu amends asc topic intangibles goodwill and other and eliminates the second step of the test for goodwill impairment goodwill represents the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their f air value goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the acquisition date based on the expected benefit to such reporting unit from the synergies of the business combination goodwill is not amortized goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level for impairment at least annually as of october or when indicators of impairment exist table of contents when indicators of impairment exist we may look to both quantitative and qualitative information to determine whether or not it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount factors considered in the assessment include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations stock performance financial performance of the reporting units and previous results of goodwill impairment tests when it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount a quantitative test is required under the new accounting guidance the quantitative analysis requires the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to be compared to its carrying amount including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment charge would be recorded for the excess not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit the adoption of this accounting guidance must be applied prospectively and is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations see note goodwill for results of our interim goodwill impairment test reference rate reform topic facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting asu we adopted asu on april the amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for certain contracts hedging relationships and other transactions that reference libor or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of rate reform the guidance is effective from the date of issuance until december the guidance permits key not to apply modification accounting or remeasure lease payments in lease contracts if the changes to the contract are related to the discontinuation of the reference rate if certain criteria are met the amendments also allow exceptions to the dedesignation criteria of the hedging relationship and the assessment of hedge effectiveness during the transition period it also allows key to make a one time election to sell transfer or both sell and transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform and that are classified as held to maturity before january this one time election may be made at any time after march but no later than december key has not made a determination on whether it will make this election at the time of adoption the guidance did not have a significant impact on keys financial condition and results of operations we will continue to assess the impact as the reference rate transition occurs over the

historical loss rates for less complex estimation methods for smaller portfolios a year fixed length look back period is used to calculate the long run average of the macroeconomic variables a four quarter reversion period is used where the macroeconomic variables linearly revert to their long run average following the two year reasonable and supportable period we develop our reasonable and

portfolio changes as such evaluating shifts in individual portfolio attributes and macroeconomic variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance economic outlook as of september the covid19 pandemic has continued to create unprecedented economic stress and uncertainty in the us and globally we utilized the moodys august consensus forecast to estimate our expected credit losses as of september this forecast considered the global economic fallout from the ongoing pandemic as well as the potential united states monetary and fiscal response we determined such forecast to be a reasonable view of the outlook for the global economy given the available information at current quarter end the baseline scenario reflects a moderate economic slowdown over the next two years in markets in which we operate us gdp rebounds with a annualized growth rate in the third quarter of but due to the unprecedented decline in the second quarter of is expected to decline approximately in all of gdp continues to grow throughout but at a declining rate and is not expected to return to prepandemic levels until early the national unemployment rate forecast is in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of and is forecast to remain in the uppersingle digits throughout to the extent we identified credit risk considerations that were not captured by the thirdparty economic forecast we addressed the risk through managements qualitative adjustments to the alll as a result of the unprecedented economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic our future loss estimates may vary considerably from our september assumptions commercial loan portfolio the alll from continuing operations for the commercial segment increased by million or from june the overall increase in the allowance is driven by updated economic forecasts and downward portfolio migration which are partially offset by a decline in loan balances the primary changes to the economic forecast include modest deterioration in the unemployment and gdp growth outlook which contributes to the alll increase for the overall commercial segment improvements in real estate price indices contributed to a modest reduction in reserve in our commercial real estate book risk rating migrations are also driving higher alll levels for the commercial and industrial segment we continue to closely monitor the oil gas exposure and the alll results reflect incremental risk considerations for this segment as of september we concluded that no alll is necessary for billion in outstanding ppp loans as they are guaranteed by the sba table of contents consumer loan portfolio the alll from continuing operations for the consumer segment decreased by million or from june the overall decrease in the allowance is driven by updated economic forecasts that capture an improving outlook for several drivers and strong portfolio performance the most meaningful changes to the economic forecast contributing to the reduction in reserves include improvement in the manheim used vehicle value index forecast which impacts the indirect loan portfolio as well as improvement in the hpi outlook as the housing market continues to display strength which impacts the residential mortgage and home equity segments as it relates to the decline in the alll due to portfolio factors shifts are largely driven by attrition

assistance programs which are addressed through qualitative adjustments credit risk profile the prevalent risk characteristic for both commercial and consumer loans is the risk of loss arising from an obligors inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms evaluation of this risk is stratified and monitored by the loan risk rating grades assigned for the commercial loan portfolios and the refreshed fico score assigned for the consumer loan portfolios the internal risk grades assigned to loans follow our definitions of pass and criticized which are consistent with published definitions of regulatory risk classifications loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on our rating scale for problem credits as minimal credit risk has been identified criticized loans are those loans that either have a potential weakness deserving managements close attention or have a welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk borrower fico scores provide information about the credit quality of our consumer loan portfolio as they provide an indication as to the likelihood that a debtor will repay its debts the scores are obtained from a nationally recognized consumer rating agency and are presented in the tables below at the dates indicated most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring loan grades are assigned at the time of origination verified by credit risk management and periodically reevaluated thereafter this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility default probability is determined based on among other factors the financial strength of the borrower an assessment of the borrowers management the borrowers
