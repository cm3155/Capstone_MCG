this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom the factors contained below among others could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance credit risk table start unfavorable developments concerning credit quality could adversely affect comericas financial results table end although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results table start declines in the businesses or industries of comericas customers could cause increased credit losses or decreased loan balances which could adversely affect comerica table end comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the automotive commercial real estate residential real estate and energy industries these industries are sensitive to global economic conditions supply chain factors andor commodities prices any decline in one of these businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica further any decline in these businesses or industries could cause decreased borrowings either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for each customer loan for more information regarding certain of comericas lines of business please see concentration of credit risk automotive lending commercial real estate lending residential real estate lending and energy lending on pages f25 through f27 of the financial section of this report table start changes in customer behavior may adversely impact comericas business financial condition and results of operations table end individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as fuel prices energy costs tariffs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements recently there have been discussions regarding potential changes to us trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs including trade policies and tariffs affecting china the european union canada and mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed and additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been proposed on october the united states canada and mexico agreed to a new trade deal the united statesmexicocanada agreement usmca to replace the north american free trade agreement the usmca subject to congressional approval passed the house of representatives on december and the senate on january the trade deal was signed by president trump on january these and any other changes in tariffs retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that comericas customers import or export could cause the prices of their products to increase which could reduce demand for such products or reduce customer margins and adversely impact their revenues financial results and ability to service debt in turn this could adversely affect comericas financial condition and results of operations further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry market risk table start governmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry and therefore impact comericas financial condition and results of operations table end monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its monetary policies determine in a large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates such as recent decreases in the federal funds rate or changes in the frbs balance sheet will influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies table start fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing could adversely affect comericas net interest income and balance sheet table end the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions and the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income and the market value of its investment securities the federal reserve lowered interest rates three times in a continued low interest rate environment could adversely affect the interest income comerica earns on loans and investments for a discussion of comericas interest rate sensitivity please see market and liquidity risk beginning on page f28 of the financial section of this report deposits make up a large portion of comericas funding portfolio comericas funding costs may continue to increase if it raises deposit rates to avoid losing customer deposits or if it loses customer deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding higher funding costs will reduce comericas net interest margin and net interest income volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions table start interest rates on comericas outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to libor which could adversely affect its revenue expenses and the value of those financial instruments table end on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after it is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next two years the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of us financial market participants selected and the federal reserve bank of new york started in may to publish the secured overnight finance rate sofr as an alternative to libor sofr is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash in the overnight us treasury repo market and differs from libor in key respects at this time while it is expected that sofr will be the successor to libor it is possible that another reference rate will become an accepted alternative to libor the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate including sofr is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on and the revenues and expenses associated with comericas floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally adversely affect the value of comericas floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect to comericas preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased securities and require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition comericas risk management processes from liborbased products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark such as sofr approximately of comericas loans at december were tied to libor which excludes the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed more information regarding the libor transition is available on page f29 under libor transition the manner and impact of this transition as well as the effect of these developments on comericas funding costs loan and investment and trading securities portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain liquidity risk table start comerica must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to meet regulatory expectations support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities table end comericas liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general or deposit competition based on interest rates which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor adversely affect comericas ability to access capital markets on favorable terms other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect comericas liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in or negative news about comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits andor negatively affect comericas ability to access the capital markets the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments counterparty availability interest rate fluctuations general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing comericas funding transactions many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which comerica has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations further if comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively comericas liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected table start reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect comerica andor the holders of its securities table end rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings in december fitch ratings revised each of comerica incorporated and comerica banks outlook from stable to negative while recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets future downgrades to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if such a reduction placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold table start the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect comerica table end comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possibly materially comerica technology risk table start comerica faces security risks including denial of service attacks hacking social engineering attacks targeting comericas colleagues and customers malware intrusion or data corruption attempts and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information adversely affect its business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure table end comericas computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties on which comerica is highly dependent are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber attacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft comericas business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in its computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access comericas network products and services its customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of its network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks cyber attacks could include computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks denial of service or information ransomware improper access by employees or vendors attacks on personal email of employees ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in comericas systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches and could result in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems as cyber threats continue to evolve comerica may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of comericas systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures comerica may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may it be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyber threats are rapidly evolving and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data like other financial services firms comerica and its third party providers continue to be the subject of cyber attacks although to this date comerica has not experienced any material losses or other material consequences related to cyber attacks future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks further cyber attacks may not be detected in a timely manner cyber attacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at comerica or third parties may result in a material loss or have material consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyber attack on comericas systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage its reputation with customers and third parties with whom it does business hacking of personal information and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause comerica serious negative consequences including loss of customers and business opportunities costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach significant business disruption to comericas operations and business misappropriation exposure or destruction of its confidential information intellectual property funds andor those of its customers or damage to comericas or comericas customers andor third parties computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention loss of confidence in comericas security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and could adversely impact its results of operations liquidity and financial condition in addition comerica may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus as cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus the federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their thirdparty service providers including comerica and its bank subsidiaries and would focus on cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations which require among other things notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data for more information regarding cybersecurity regulation refer to the supervision and regulation section of this report comerica receives maintains and stores nonpublic personal information of comericas customers and counterparties including but not limited to personally identifiable information and personal financial information the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state law both personally identifiable information and personal financial information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected and handled for example in june of the governor of california signed into law the ccpa the ccpa which became effective on january applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds including comerica for more information regarding data privacy regulation refer to the supervision and regulation section of this report comerica may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information comerica may store or maintain comerica could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that comerica is required to alter its systems or require changes to its business practices or privacy policies if cybersecurity data privacy data protection data transfer or data retention laws are implemented interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with comericas current practices it may be subject to fines litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change its business practices policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts comericas operating results operational risk table start comericas operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could fail or be breached which could disrupt comericas business and adversely impact comericas results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm table end the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout comericas business and as a result of its interactions with and reliance on third parties is not limited to comericas own internal operational functions comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks these networks are subject to infrastructure failures ongoing system maintenance and upgrades and planned network outages the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems comerica relies on its employees and third parties in its daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct malfeasance or failure or breach of comericas or of thirdparty systems or infrastructure expose comerica to risk for example comericas ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to comerica or to third parties with whom comerica interacts or upon whom it relies although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data in addition comericas ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems is more limited than with respect to its own systems comericas financial accounting data processing backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which could adversely affect its ability to process transactions or provide services such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume andor customer activity electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes and floods disease pandemics cyber attacks and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including wars and terrorist acts the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica table start comerica relies on other companies to provide certain key components of its delivery systems and certain failures could materially adversely affect operations table end comerica faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its delivery systems third party vendors provide certain key components of comericas delivery systems such as cloudbased computing networking and storage services payment processing services recording and monitoring services internet connections and network access clearing agency services card processing services and trust processing services while comerica conducts due diligence prior to engaging with third party vendors and performs ongoing monitoring of vendor controls it does not control their operations further while comericas vendor management policies and practices are designed to comply with current regulations these policies and practices cannot eliminate this risk in this context any vendor failure to properly deliver these services could adversely affect comericas business operations and result in financial loss reputational harm andor regulatory action table start legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry including those directly involving comerica and its subsidiaries could adversely affect comerica or the financial services industry in general table end comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in fines or actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could adversely affect comericas results of operations and financial condition table start comerica may incur losses due to fraud table end fraudulent activity can take many forms and has escalated as more tools for accessing financial services emerge such as realtime payments fraud schemes are broad and continuously evolving examples include but are not limited to debit cardcredit card fraud check fraud mechanical devices attached to atm machines social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information impersonation of our clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials employee fraud information theft and other malfeasance increased deployment of technologies such as chip card technology defray and reduce aspects of fraud however criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information in order to impersonate the consumer to commit fraud many of these data compromises have been widely reported in the media further as a result of the increased sophistication of fraud activity comerica continues to invest in systems resources and controls to detect and prevent fraud this will result in continued ongoing investments in the future table start controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud table end controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports comerica files or submits under the exchange act is accurately accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met due to certain inherent limitations these limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn that breakdowns can occur because of an error or mistake or that controls may be fraudulently circumvented accordingly because of the inherent limitations in control systems misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected compliance risk table start changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on comericas operations table end comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the occ the cfpb the sec finra dol msrb and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs and limits the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations and ability to make acquisitions investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions may adversely affect comericas businesses or operations table start compliance with stringent capital requirements may adversely affect comerica table end comerica is required to satisfy stringent regulatory capital standards as set forth in the supervision and regulation section of this report these requirements and any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders maintaining higher levels of capital may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations table start tax regulations could be subject to potential legislative administrative or judicial changes or interpretations table end federal income tax treatment of corporations may be clarified andor modified by legislative administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time any such changes could adversely affect comerica either directly or indirectly as a result of effects on comericas customers for example the tax reform bill enacted on december has had and is expected to continue to have farreaching and significant effects on comerica its customers and the us economy financial reporting risk table start changes in accounting standards could materially impact comericas financial statements table end from time to time accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of comericas financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases comerica could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in changes to previously reported financial results or a cumulative charge to retained earnings in particular the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued a new accounting standard cecl for the recognition and measurement of credit losses for loans and debt securities the new standard will be effective for comerica in the first quarter the anticipated change in loan loss reserves due to cecl is approximately a million decrease to comericas credit loss reserves at adoption as well as a corresponding increase to retained earnings of million and a decrease of million to deferred tax assets table start comericas accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of financial condition and results of operations they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain table end accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see critical accounting policies on pages f34 through f36 of the financial section of this report and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on pages f45 through f57 of the financial section of this report strategic risk table start damage to comericas reputation could damage its businesses table end reputational risk is an increasing concern for businesses as customers are interested in doing business with companies they admire and trust such risks include compliance issues operational challenges or a strategic high profile event comericas business is based on the trust of its customers communities and entire value chain which makes managing reputational risk extremely important news or other publicity that impairs comericas reputation or the reputation of the financial services industry generally can therefore cause significant harm to comericas business and prospects further adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding comerica whether or not true may result in harm to comericas prospects table start comerica may not be able to utilize technology to efficiently and effectively develop market and deliver new products and services to its customers table end the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry and having the right technology is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as well the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations table start competitive product and pricing pressures within comericas markets may change table end comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes in terms of products and pricing with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer additionally the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation for more information see the supervision and regulation section of this report such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions including comerica to engage in certain activities comericas competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer and commercial finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations table start the introduction implementation withdrawal success and timing of business initiatives and strategies may be less successful or may be different than anticipated which could adversely affect comericas business table end comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business table start managements ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations table end the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings table start managements ability to retain key officers and employees may change table end comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry in the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section of the doddfrank act section directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions as referenced above or companies in other industries which may not be subject to the same requirements comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees table start any future strategic acquisitions or divestitures may present certain risks to comericas business and operations table end difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected further the assimilation of any acquired entitys customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica would be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of comerica general risk table start general political economic or industry conditions either domestically or internationally may be less favorable than expected table end local domestic and international events including economic financial market political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the economic environment and market conditions in which comerica operates continue to be uncertain while many us economic indicators at the end of were positive and consistent with an ongoing economic expansion activity in the us manufacturing sector slowed and trade policy and weak global demand remained major sources of uncertainty for businesses and markets conditions related to inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts changes in trade policies and other factors such as real estate values energy prices state and local municipal budget deficits government spending and the us national debt outside of our control may directly and indirectly adversely affect comerica table start methods of reducing risk exposures might not be effective table end instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of credit market liquidity technology operational compliance financial reporting and strategic risks could be less effective than anticipated as a result comerica may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk which could have a material adverse
