item risk factors other than as set forth below there has been no material change in the corporations risk factors as previously disclosed in the corporations annual report in response to part i item of such report such risk factors are incorporated herein by reference below we amend the following risk factors discussed in part i item risk factors liquidity risk in the corporations annual report comerica must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to meet regulatory expectations support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities comericas liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general or deposit competition based on interest rates which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor adversely affect comericas ability to access capital markets on favorable terms other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect comericas liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in or negative news about comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits andor negatively affect comericas ability to access the capital markets the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments counterparty availability interest rate fluctuations general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing comericas funding transactions many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which comerica has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future as comerica experienced following the collapse of silicon valley bank signature bank and first republic bank the failure of other financial institutions may cause deposit outflows as customers spread deposits among several different banks so as to maximize their amount of fdic insurance move deposits to banks deemed too big to fail or remove deposits from the us financial system entirely comerica has a high percentage of uninsured deposits and relies on its deposit base for liquidity if comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively comericas liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect comerica comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions comerica may be impacted if the collateral held by it cannot be monetized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica further volatility in the banking industry following the collapse of silicon valley bank signature bank and first republic bank may lead to greater reliance on third parties that provide money market or deposit sweep services in addition many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possibly materially comerica reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect comerica andor the holders of its securities rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally for instance in april moodys downgraded the corporation and banks credit ratings by one notch to baa1 from a3 and changed the corporation and banks outlooks to negative related to uncertainty in the banking industry following the collapse of silicon valley bank signature bank and first republic bank and the subsequent impacts since the recent banking industry disruption moodys has lowered the macro profile of the us banking system to strong from very strong reflecting general concern around the banking industry as a whole there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings or that comericas credit ratings will not be downgraded again in the future the impact of the recent downgrade to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if future reductions placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold
