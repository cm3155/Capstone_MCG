this report or previously disclosed in comericas sec reports accessible on the secs website at wwwsecgov or on comericas website at wwwcomericacom the factors contained below among others could cause actual results to differ materially from forwardlooking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance credit risk unfavorable developments concerning credit quality could adversely affect comericas financial results although comerica regularly reviews credit exposure related to its customers and various industry sectors in which it has business relationships default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee under such circumstances as occurred during the covid19 pandemic comerica could experience an increase in the level of provision for credit losses nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and reserve for credit losses which could adversely affect comericas financial results declines in the businesses or industries of comericas customers could cause increased credit losses or decreased loan balances which could adversely affect comerica comericas business customer base consists in part of customers in volatile businesses and industries such as the automotive commercial real estate residential real estate and energy industries these industries are sensitive to global economic conditions supply chain factors andor commodities prices in pa rticular in decreased balances in dealer services occurred due to an imbalance in supply and demand impacted by a shortage in microchips used in automotive production additionally as companies implement policies to extend workfromhome arrangements the commercial real estate industry has been under more scrutiny finally while energy prices recovered in they are unlikely to remain stable and energy companies are expected to experience environmental pressure over the longterm any decline in one of these businesses or industries could cause increased credit losses which in turn could adversely affect comerica further any decline in these businesses or industries could cause decreased borrowings either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for each customer loan for more information regarding certain of comericas lines of business please see concentrations of credit risk commercial real estate lending automotive lending dealer automotive lending production residential real estate lendingand energy lending on pages f23 through f25 of the financial section of this report additionally certain industries have been particularly susceptible to the effects of the pandemic such as retail commercial real estate retail goods and services hotels artsrecreation airlines restaurants and bars childcare coffee shops cruise lines education gasoline and convenience stores religious organizations senior living freight and travel arrangements and comerica has outstanding loans to clients in these industries as described below under other sectors most at risk due to economic stress resulting from covid19 impacts on page f26 of the financial section of this report changes in customer behavior due to outside factors may adversely impact comericas business financial condition and results of operations individual economic political industryspecific conditions and other factors outside of comericas control such as pandemics inflation fuel prices energy costs tariffs real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels could alter predicted customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect comericas ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements further difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels a decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on comerica comericas customers and others in the financial institutions industry market risk governmental monetary and fiscal policies may adversely affect the financial services industry and therefore impact comericas financial condition and results of operations monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular the frb affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the us and its monetary policies determine in large part comericas cost of funds for lending and investing and the return that can be earned on such loans and investments changes in such policies including changes in interest rates or changes in the frbs balance sheet influence the origination of loans the value of investments the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits changes in monetary and fiscal policies are beyond comericas control and difficult to predict comericas financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on deposit pricing could adversely affect comericas net interest income and balance sheet the operations of financial institutions such as comerica are dependent to a large degree on net interest income which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings prevailing economic conditions and the trade fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit which in turn significantly affect financial institutions net interest income and the market value of its investment securities a continued low interest rate environment will adversely affect the interest income comerica earns on loans and investments for a discussion of comericas interest rate sensitivity please see market and liquidity risk beginning on page f27 of the financial section of this report deposits make up a large portion of comericas funding portfolio comericas funding costs may increase if it raises deposit rates to avoid losing customer deposits or if it loses customer deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding higher funding costs will reduce comericas net interest margin and net interest income volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles which because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions comericas financial results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in financial market conditions interest rates on comericas outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on developments related to libor which could adversely affect its revenue expenses and the value of those financial instruments on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor publicly announced that it intended to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after certain libor tenors are no longer supported as of december and the fca has announced that the remaining tenors including those most commonly used by comerica will cease to be supported after june while comerica stopped originating liborbased products in the fourth quarter of it still has substantial exposure to outstanding liborbased products including loans and derivatives approximately percent of comericas loans at december were tied to libor which excludes the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed comerica is currently issuing new secured overnight financing rate sofrbased and bloomberg shortterm bank yield index bsbybased cash and derivative products comerica continues to monitor market developments and regulatory updates as well as collaborate with regulators and industry groups on the transition the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular such transition could adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on and the revenues and expenses associated with comericas floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libors historical role in determining market interest rates globally adversely affect the value of comericas floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libors historical role in determining market interest rates globally prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect to comericas selection of alternative reference rates other than sofr and result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased instruments more information regarding the libor transition is available on page f30 under libor transition the manner and impact of this transition as well as the effect of these developments on comericas funding costs loan and investment and trading securities portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain liquidity risk comerica must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity to meet regulatory expectations support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities comericas liquidity and ability to fund and run its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general or deposit competition based on interest rates which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor adversely affect comericas ability to access capital markets on favorable terms other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect comericas liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in or negative news about comerica or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits andor negatively affect comericas ability to access the capital markets the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments counterparty availability interest rate fluctuations general economic conditions and the legal regulatory accounting and tax environments governing comericas funding transactions many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which comerica has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future further comericas customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions which could have a negative impact on comericas business financial condition and results of operations additionally if comerica is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if comerica suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively comericas liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect comerica andor the holders of its securities rating agencies regularly evaluate comerica and their ratings are based on a number of factors including comericas financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that comerica will maintain its current ratings while recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets future downgrades to comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings could adversely affect comericas profitability borrowing costs or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on comericas results of operations or financial condition if such a reduction placed comericas or its subsidiaries credit ratings below investment grade it could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase comericas costs under such arrangements additionally a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect comerica comericas ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships comerica has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led and may further lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions could expose comerica to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client in addition comericas credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be monetized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to comerica there is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect possibly materially comerica technology risk comerica faces security risks including denial of service attacks hacking social engineering attacks targeting comericas colleagues and customers malware intrusion or data corruption attempts and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information adversely affect its business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure comericas computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties on which comerica is highly dependent are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber attacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft comericas business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in its computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access comericas network products and services its customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of its network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks cyber attacks could include computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks denial of service or information ransomware improper access by employees or vendors attacks on personal email of employees ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in comericas systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches and could result in the destruction or exfiltration of data and systems as cyber threats continue to evolve comerica may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of comericas systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures comerica may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may it be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyber threats are rapidly evolving and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data like other financial services firms comerica and its third party providers continue to be the subject of cyber attacks although to this date comerica has not experienced any material losses or other material consequences related to cyber attacks future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging and comerica may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks further cyber attacks may not be detected in a timely manner cyber attacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at comerica or third parties may result in a material loss or have material consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyber attack on comericas systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage its reputation with customers and third parties with whom it does business hacking of personal information and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause comerica serious negative consequences including loss of customers and business opportunities costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach significant business disruption to comericas operations and business misappropriation exposure or destruction of its confidential information intellectual property funds andor those of its customers or damage to comericas or comericas customers andor third parties computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention loss of confidence in comericas security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and could adversely impact its results of operations liquidity and financial condition in addition although comerica maintains insurance coverage that may cover certain cyber losses subject to policy terms and conditions we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus as cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus the federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their thirdparty service providers including comerica and its bank subsidiaries and would focus on cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations which require among other things notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data for more information regarding cybersecurity regulation refer to the supervision and regulation section of this report comerica receives maintains and stores nonpublic personal information of comericas customers and counterparties including but not limited to personally identifiable information and personal financial information the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state law both personally identifiable information and personal financial information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected and handled for example in june of the governor of california signed into law the ccpa the ccpa which became effective on january applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds including comerica for more information regarding data privacy regulation refer to the supervision and regulation section of this report comerica may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information comerica may store or maintain comerica could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that comerica is required to alter its systems or require changes to its business practices or privacy policies if cybersecurity data privacy data protection data transfer or data retention laws are implemented interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with comericas current practices it may be subject to fines litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change its business practices policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts comericas operating results operational risk comericas operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could fail or be breached which could disrupt comericas business and adversely impact comericas results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout comericas business and as a result of its interactions with and reliance on third parties is not limited to comericas own internal operational functions comericas operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks these networks are subject to infrastructure failures ongoing system maintenance and upgrades and planned network outages comericas use of mobile and cloud technologies as well as its hybrid work options permitting remote work can heighten these and other operational risks any failure interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in comericas customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems comerica relies on its employees and third parties in its daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct malfeasance or failure or breach of comericas or of thirdparty systems or infrastructure expose comerica to risk for example comericas ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to comerica or to third parties with whom comerica interacts or upon whom it relies although comerica has programs in place related to business continuity disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of its systems business applications and customer information such disruptions may still give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to comerica including loss of customer data in addition comericas ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems is more limited than with respect to its own systems comericas financial accounting data processing backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond its control which could adversely affect its ability to process transactions or provide services such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume andor customer activity electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes and floods disease pandemics cyber attacks and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including wars and terrorist acts the occurrence of any failure or interruption in comericas operations or information systems or any security breach could cause reputational damage jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information result in a loss of customer business subject comerica to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on comerica comerica relies on other companies to provide certain key components of its delivery systems and certain failures could materially adversely affect operations comerica faces the risk of operational disruption failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third party vendors for components of its delivery systems third party vendors provide certain key components of comericas delivery systems such as cloudbased computing networking and storage services payment processing services recording and monitoring services internet connections and network access clearing agency services card processing services and trust processing services while comerica conducts due diligence prior to engaging with third party vendors and performs ongoing monitoring of vendor controls it does not control their operations further while comericas vendor management policies and practices are designed to comply with current regulations these policies and practices cannot eliminate this risk in this context any vendor failure to properly deliver these services could adversely affect comericas business operations and result in financial loss reputational harm andor regulatory action legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters with respect to the financial services industry including those directly involving comerica and its subsidiaries could adversely affect comerica or the financial services industry in general comerica has been and may in the future be subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters and there can be no assurance that comerica will prevail in any proceeding or litigation any such matter could result in substantial cost and diversion of comericas efforts which by itself could have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and operating results further adverse determinations in such matters could result in fines or actions by comericas regulators that could materially adversely affect comericas business financial condition or results of operations comerica establishes reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated comerica may still incur legal costs for a matter even if it has not established a reserve in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could adversely affect comericas results of operations and financial condition comerica may incur losses due to fraud fraudulent activity can take many forms and has escalated as more tools for accessing financial services emerge such as realtime payments fraud schemes are broad and continuously evolving examples include but are not limited to debit cardcredit card fraud check fraud mechanical devices attached to atm machines social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information impersonation of our clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials employee fraud information theft and other malfeasance increased deployment of technologies such as chip card technology defray and reduce aspects of fraud however criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information in order to impersonate the consumer to commit fraud many of these data compromises have been widely reported in the media further as a result of the increased sophistication of fraud activity comerica continues to invest in systems resources and controls to detect and prevent fraud this will result in continued ongoing investments in the future controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports comerica files or submits under the exchange act is accurately accumulated and communicated to management and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the secs rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met due to certain inherent limitations these limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn that breakdowns can occur because of an error or mistake or that controls may be fraudulently circumvented accordingly because of the inherent limitations in control systems misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected compliance risk changes in regulation or oversight or changes in comericas status with respect to existing regulations or oversight may have a material adverse impact on comericas operations comerica is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by the us treasury the texas department of banking the fdic the frb the occ the cfpb the cftc the sec finra dol msrb and other regulatory bodies such regulation and supervision governs and limits the activities in which comerica may engage regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities including the imposition of restrictions on comericas operations and ability to make acquisitions investigations and limitations related to comericas securities the classification of comericas assets and determination of the level of comericas allowance for loan losses any change in such regulation and oversight whether in the form of regulatory policy regulations legislation or supervisory action may have a material adverse impact on comericas business financial condition or results of operations the impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions may adversely affect comericas businesses or operations further even if such regulations or oversight do not change comericas business may develop such that it may be subject to increased regulatory requirements in comericas asset size increased and began to approach billion certain enhanced prudential standards and related requirements will apply to comerica if it exceeds billion in average total consolidated assets calculated over four consecutive financial quarters which could happen in the future category iv institutions to billion in assets under the tailoring rules are subject to additional requirements such as certain enhanced prudential standards and monitoring and reporting certain riskbased indicators under the tailoring rules category iv firms are among other things subject to supervisory capital stress testing on a biennial basis requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements including liquidity buffer and liquidity stress testing requirements comerica would also incur additional assessments under regulation tt if comerica becomes subject to enhanced prudential standards it will face more stringent requirements or limitations on its business as well as increased compliance costs and depending on its levels of capital and liquidity stress test results and other factors may be limited in the types of activities it may conduct and be limited as to how it utilizes capital further comerica may be subject to heightened expectations which could result in additional regulatory scrutiny higher penalties and more severe consequences if it is unable to meet those expectations compliance with stringent capital requirements may adversely affect comerica comerica is required to satisfy stringent regulatory capital standards as set forth in the supervision and regulation section of this report these requirements and any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity or any existing requirements that comerica becomes subject to as a result of its increased asset size could adversely affect comericas ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or could require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition andor existing shareholders maintaining higher levels of capital may reduce comericas profitability and otherwise adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations tax regulations could be subject to potential legislative administrative or judicial changes or interpretations federal income tax treatment of corporations may be clarified andor modified by legislative administrative or judicial changes or interpretations at any time any such changes could adversely affect comerica either directly or indirectly as a result of effects on comericas customers strategic risk damage to comericas reputation could damage its businesses reputational risk is an increasing concern for businesses as customers are interested in doing business with companies they admire and trust such risks include compliance issues operational challenges or a strategic high profile event comericas business is based on the trust of its customers communities and entire value chain which makes managing reputational risk extremely important news or other publicity that impairs comericas reputation or the reputation of the financial services industry generally can therefore cause significant harm to comericas business and prospects further adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding comerica whether or not true may result in harm to comericas prospects comerica may not be able to utilize technology to efficiently and effectively develop market and deliver new products and services to its customers the financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technologydriven products and services the ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry and having the right technology is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as well the efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to reduce costs comericas future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands meet regulatory requirements and create additional efficiencies in comericas operations comerica may not be able to effectively develop new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to its customers which could have a material adverse impact on comericas financial condition and results of operations competitive product and pricing pressures within comericas markets may change comerica operates in a very competitive environment which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates comerica competes largely on the basis of industry expertise the range of products and services offered pricing and reputation customer convenience quality customer service and responsiveness to customer needs and the overall relationship with our clients our competitors are large national and regional financial institutions as well as smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer additionally the financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation for more information see the supervision and regulation section of this report such regulations may require significant additional investments in technology personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions including comerica to engage in certain activities comericas competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer and commercial finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures if comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets business could decline which could have a material adverse effect on comericas business financial condition or results of operations the introduction implementation withdrawal success and timing of business initiatives and strategies may be less successful or may be different than anticipated which could adversely affect comericas business comerica makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products if comerica does not accurately determine demand for its banking and financial product needs it could result in comerica incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue which could result in a material adverse effect on its business recently comerica expanded its presence in the southeastern us by establishing commercial offices in north carolina if comericas expansion is not successful it could adversely impact comericas expenses managements ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations the financial services industry is very competitive comerica not only vies for business opportunities with new customers but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers while management believes that it can continue to grow many of these relationships comerica will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture its customers these pressures may be exacerbated by the continued disruption to inperson activities due to covid19 failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact comericas earnings managements ability to retain key officers and employees may change comericas future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel comericas future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management financial technical marketing sales and support personnel competition for qualified personnel is intense and comerica cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for comerica to hire personnel over time further comericas ability to retain key officers and employees may be impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry in the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section of the doddfrank act section directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation accordingly comerica may be at a disadvantage to offer competitive compensation compared to other financial institutions as referenced above or companies in other industries which may not be subject to the same requirements comericas business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees or comericas inability to attract and retain skilled employees any future strategic acquisitions or divestitures may present certain risks to comericas business and operations difficulties in capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a future acquisition may prevent comerica from fully achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition or may cause the achievement of such expectations to take longer to realize than expected further the assimilation of any acquired entitys customers and markets could result in higher than expected deposit attrition loss of key employees disruption of comericas businesses or the businesses of the acquired entity or otherwise adversely affect comericas ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition these matters could have an adverse effect on comerica for an undetermined period comerica would be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future decisions to downsize sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of comerica general risk the covid19 pandemic has and will likely continue to adversely impact our business and the ultimate impact on our business and financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains lowered equity market valuations created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and increased unemployment levels as a result of the continued uncertainty related to the pandemic and its variants the demand for our products and services has been and is expected to continue to be significantly impacted furthermore the pandemic has influenced and could further influence the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and has increased and could further increase our allowance for credit losses as long as some businesses operations are impacted and as more customers may draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses in response to the pandemic we granted hardship relief assistance for customers experiencing financial difficulty as a result of covid19 including loan deferrals as of december pandemicrelated payment deferrals totaled million representing approximately obligors and consisting entirely of retail loans primarily residential mortgages certain industries have been particularly susceptible to the effects of the pandemic such as retail commercial real estate retail goods and services hotels artsrecreation airlines restaurants and bars childcare coffee shops cruise lines education gasoline and convenience stores religious organizations senior living freight and travel arrangements and comerica has outstanding loans to clients in these industries as described below under other sectors most at risk due to economic stress resulting from covid19 impacts on page f26 comericas business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business results of operations and financial condition as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic general political economic or industry conditions either domestically or internationally may be less favorable than expected local domestic and international events including economic financial market political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry directly and indirectly the economic environment and market conditions in which comerica operates continue to be uncertain while stimulus packages the rollout of the covid vaccine strong business spending and improved labor markets contributed to an overall improved economic outlook in there continues to be uncertainty related to the impact of emerging covid19 variants and vaccine efficacy supply chain constraints future monetary and fiscal support and inflationary pressures c onditions related to the covid19 pandemic inflation recession unemployment volatile interest rates international conflicts changes in trade policies and other factors such as real estate values energy prices state and local municipal budget deficits government spending and

management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain accounting estimates and processes are fundamental to how comerica records and reports its financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting estimates and processes so they comply with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in some cases management must select an accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in the company reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative management has identified certain accounting estimates as being critical because they require managements judgment to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates comerica has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters comerica cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements see critical accounting
