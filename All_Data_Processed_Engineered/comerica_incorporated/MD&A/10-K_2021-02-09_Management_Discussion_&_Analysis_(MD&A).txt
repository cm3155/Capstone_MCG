corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities market segment results are also provided for the corporations three primary geographic markets michigan california and texas in addition to the three primary geographic markets other markets is also reported as a market segment note to the consolidated financial statements describes the corporations segment reporting methodology as well as the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business and market segments for the years ended december and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the long term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities due to the longerterm nature of implied maturities ftp crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets as a result of applying matched funding interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds as well as the volume of deposits at the associated ftp crediting rates as overall interest rates decreased in business segments particularly those focused on generating deposits were impacted by lower ftp crediting rates on deposits compared to the prior year similarly ftp charges for funding loans decreased in effective january the corporation prospectively discontinued allocating an additional ftp charge for the cost of maintaining liquid assets to support potential draws on unfunded loan commitments

quarterly calculation of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending related commitments and calculations of both expected and unexpected loss allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments effective january the allowance for credit losses reflected the adoption of topic which requires companies to estimate credit losses using the cecl framework as a percentage of total loans the allowance for credit losses was percent at december compared to percent at december excluding billion in ppp loans which are guaranteed by the small business administration the allowance for credit losses was percent of total loans at december the allowance for credit losses covered times and times total nonperforming loans at december and december respectively at adoption on january the scope and severity of the economic crisis resulting from the covid19 pandemic were unknown as such the economic scenario used by the corporation to develop its estimate of cecl as of the adoption date reflected a continued moderate us economic expansion compared to levels and a stable interest rate environment with the federal funds rate remaining in the to 175percent range other assumptions included the resolution of trade tensions a calmer global economy and a strong us dollar all of which supported modest industrial production growth and stable oil prices the forecast also assumed strong labor market conditions to support the consumer sector management considered the level of uncertainty regarding its economic assumptions as part of the qualitative adjustment the adoption of cecl resulted in a million dayone decrease in the allowance for credit losses from million at december under the incurred loss model see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the adoption of cecl the allowance for credit losses increased by million from the adoption date to million at december primarily reflecting the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the response by domestic and global governmental authorities including quarantines and other social distancing policies aimed at fighting the spread of the virus in early energy markets which were experiencing stress prior to the pandemic were further impacted by the rapid decline in demand resulting from social distancing policies energy prices and demand improved in the second half of as the economy began to recover but energy markets remain uncertain the us economy contracted into a recession with unusual speed and force in the first half of ending the longest expansionary period in us history the us government and the federal reserve responded to the pandemic with unprecedented measures the federal reserve reduced the target federal funds rate to zero to percent and congress passed the cares act that included an estimated trillion stimulus package although the us economy began to recover in third quarter as social distancing policies loosened economic metrics in fourth quarter indicate an uneven path to recovery in december congress amended the cares act through the consolidated appropriations act of to add an additional billion of stimulus relief to mitigate the continued impacts of the pandemic while certain factors point to improving economic conditions uncertainty remains regarding the path of the economic recovery the mitigating impacts of government interventions the success of vaccine distribution and the efficacy of administered vaccines as well as the effects of the change in leadership resulting from the recent elections these factors shaped the 2year reasonable and supportable forecast used by the corporation in its cecl modeled estimate at december after a partial rebound in real gross domestic product gdp growth in third and fourth quarters forecasted gdp reaches prepandemic fourth quarter levels by the latter portion of normalizing into historical growth rates in the second half of the forecast period forecasts for other key economic variables including the unemployment rate and oil prices are generally in line with gdp projections interest rates remain low reflecting the federal reserves expectation that rates will remain at current levels in the nearto midterm while corporate bond rates reflect decreasing default risk with slight improvements as the forecasted horizon moved by one quarter economic forecasts for fourth quarter were generally consistent with third quarter forecasts the following table summarizes the forecasts for the economic variables most impactful to the allowance for credit losses estimate at december f23 table of contents economic variable

prices steadily increase from to per barrel by fourth quarter due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate economic consequences of the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of the governments stimulus packages management considered other economic scenarios to make appropriate qualitative adjustments for certain sectors of its lending portfolio including more benign and more severe forecasts refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimates of current expected credit losses in the corporations loan portfolio pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors designed to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools the allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for including adjustments for foresight risk input imprecisions and model imprecision credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs and are based on one of several methods including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors determined in a manner similar to business loans multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk applied to

company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and debt obligations with a target of months but no less than months corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting of the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at december was percent libor percent prime and percent fixed rate additionally percent of loans had nonzero interest rate floors protecting against future rate declines the composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes as of the balance sheet dates are included in the analysis but no additional hedging is forecasted at december these derivative instruments comprise interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt to variable rates through fair value hedges and convert billion of variablerate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges additionally included in this analysis are billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of percent at december this basecase net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline basis points f33 table of contents with a floor of zero percent in a linear nonparallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of basis points over the period each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior yield curve changes loan and deposit pricing and overall balance sheet mix and growth in this low rate environment depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends as a result the rising rate scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates rise changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis the table below as of december and displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above dollar amounts in millions december change in interest rates rising basis points declining to zero percent amount estimated annual change change in interest rates amount rising basis points declining basis points sensitivity to declining interest rates decreased from december to december due to changes in balance sheet composition as well as limited remaining downward movement in rates before hitting zero percent floors sensitivity to rising interest rates increased due to changes in balance sheet composition partially offset by fixedrate ppp lending and an increase in the number of variablerate loans with active floors sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity at december the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel basis point shock with a floor of zero percent compared to an immediate parallel basis point shock at december the table below as of december and displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenarios described above dollar amounts in millions december change in interest rates amount rising basis points declining to zero percent change in interest rates rising basis points declining basis points amount the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates increased from december to december

liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments such environments cover a series of broad events distinguished in terms of duration and severity the evaluation as of december projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events other market risks market risk related to the corporations trading instruments is not significant as trading activities are limited certain components of the corporations noninterest income primarily fiduciary income are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets particularly equity and debt securities other components of noninterest income primarily brokerage fees are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity f37 table of contents operational risk operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people or from external events excluding in most cases those driven by technology see technology risk below the corporations definition of operational risk includes fraud employment practice and workplace safety clients products and business practice business continuity or disaster recovery execution delivery and process management third party and model risks the definition does not include strategic or reputational risks although operational losses are experienced by all companies and are routinely incurred in business operations the corporation recognizes the need to identify and control operational losses and seeks to limit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management as outlined in the corporations risk appetite statement the appropriate risk level is determined through consideration of the nature of the corporations business and the environment in which it operates in combination with the impact from and the possible impact on other risks faced by the corporation operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operating risks at appropriate levels the operational risk management committee monitors risk management techniques and systems the corporation has developed a framework that includes a centralized operational risk reporting function in the enterprise risk division and businesssupport unit risk liaisons responsible for managing operational risk specific to the respective business lines technology risk technology risk represents the risk of loss or adverse outcomes arising from the people processes applications and infrastructure that support the technology environment the corporations definition of technology risk includes technology delivery risk technology investment risk cybersecurity risk information security risk and information management risk technology risk is inclusive of the risks associated with the execution of technology processes and activities by thirdparty contractors and suppliers to the corporation other risk types may materialize in the event of a technology risk event such as the risk of a financial reporting error or regulatory noncompliance and the impact of such risks are highly interdependent with operational risk the technology risk management committee comprising senior and executive business unit managers as well as managers responsible for technology cybersecurity information security and enterprise risk management oversees technology risk the technology risk management committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level compliance risk compliance risk represents the risk of sanctions or financial loss resulting from the corporations failure to comply with all applicable laws regulations and standards of good banking practice the impact of such risks is highly interdependent with strategic risk as the reputational impact from compliance breaches can be severe activities which may expose the corporation to compliance risk include but are not limited to those dealing with the prevention of money laundering privacy and data protection community reinvestment initiatives fair lending consumer protection employment and tax matters overthecounter derivative activities and other regulated activities the enterprisewide compliance committee comprising senior and executive business unit managers as well as managers responsible for compliance audit and overall risk oversees compliance risk this enterprisewide approach provides a consistent view of compliance across the organization the enterprisewide compliance committee also ensures that appropriate actions are implemented in business units to mitigate risk to an acceptable level strategic risk strategic risk represents the risk of inadequate returns or possible losses due to impairment of reputation failure to fully develop and execute business plans failure to assess current and new opportunities in business markets and products failure to determine appropriate consideration for risks accepted and any other event not identified in the defined risk categories of credit market and liquidity operational technology or compliance risks mitigation of the various risk elements that represent strategic risk is achieved through numerous metrics and initiatives to help the corporation better understand measure and report on such risks the executive strategic and pricing committee comprised of senior managers oversees strategic risk and ensures that strategic risk is mitigated to appropriate levels f38 table of contents critical accounting policies the corporations consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies the most significant of which are described in note these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations changes in underlying factors assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the corporations future financial condition and results of operations at december the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses fair value measurement goodwill pension plan accounting and income taxes these policies were reviewed with the audit committee of the corporations board of directors and are discussed more fully below allowance for credit losses in accordance with cecl the allowance for credit losses which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve for current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the portfolio the corporation uses loss factors based on estimated probability of default for internal risk ratings and loss given default to determine the allowance for credit losses for the majority of its portfolio management applies loss factors to pools of loans and lendingrelated commitments with similar risk characteristics calibrates these factors using economic forecasts and incorporates qualitative adjustments for further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the economic forecast incorporated into the model refer to the risk management section of this financial review managements determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio lendingrelated commitments current as well as forecasted economic factors and other relevant information the calculation is inherently subjective and requires management to exercise significant judgment in developing assumptions for the estimate the most significant of which are the loan risk rating process development of economic forecasts and application of qualitative adjustments sensitivities are disclosed to demonstrate how changes in loan risk ratings and economic forecast scenarios may impact the allowance for credit losses sensitivities only consider changes to each specific assumption in isolation and their impact to the quantitative modeled results they do not contemplate impacts to the qualitative framework loan risk rating process reserve factors are applied to pools of loans based on risk characteristics including the corporations internal risk rating system therefore loss estimates are highly dependent on the accuracy of the risk rating assigned to each loan the inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning andor entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system is monitored by the corporations asset quality review function changes to internal risk ratings beyond the forecasted migration inherent in the credit models would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses to illustrate if percent of the individual risk ratings were adjusted down by one rating across all pools the allowance for loan losses as of december would change by approximately million forecasted economic variables management selects models through which historical reserve factor estimates are calibrated to economic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that statistically correlate with the probability of default and loss given default pools loss estimates revert to historical loss experience for contractual lives beyond the forecast period management selects economic variables it believes to be most relevant based on the composition of the loan portfolio and customer base including forecasted levels of employment gross domestic product corporate bond and treasury spreads industrial production levels consumer and commercial real estate price indices as well as housing statistics the allowance for credit losses is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the estimate due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions such as the ultimate impact of the global pandemic and effectiveness of government stimulus programs the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including a more severe economic forecast scenario with varying speeds of recovery the following table summarizes the more severe forecast scenario for the economic variables that are most impactful f39 table of contents economic variable real gdp growth unemployment rate corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spreads oil prices more severe forecast contracts through third quarter including a percent decline in the first quarter followed by a gradual improvement to a growth rate above percent by the end of the forecast period current levels increase to near percent in the second half of gradually lowering to below percent by the end of the forecast period spreads widen above percent in the near term gradually normalizing to percent or lower in decline below per barrel partway through the forecast period before improving to over per barrel by fourth quarter selecting a different forecast in the current environment could result in a significantly different estimated allowance for credit losses to illustrate absent model overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process if the corporation selected the more severe scenario to inform its models the allowance for credit losses as of december would increase by approximately million however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario qualitative adjustments and model overlays the corporation includes qualitative adjustments as appropriate intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative estimate including foresight risk model imprecisions and input imprecisions qualitative adjustments for foresight risk reflect the inherent imprecision in economic forecasts and may be included based on managements evaluation of different forecast scenarios ranging from more benign to more severe and known recent events impacting the corporations portfolio model imprecision adjustments and model overlays may be included to mitigate known limitations in the quantitative models input imprecision includes adjustments for portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter risk ratings once evidence is acquired as well as a qualitative assessment of the lending environment including underwriting standards current economic and political conditions and other factors affecting credit quality qualitative reserves at december primarily included adjustments for uncertainties related to forecasted economic variables other considerations to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods the allowance is assigned to business segments and any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from management estimates would primarily affect the commercial bank segment fair value measurement investment securities availableforsale derivatives and deferred compensation plan assets and associated liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis additionally from time to time other assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis such as impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral other real estate primarily foreclosed property nonmarketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve writedowns of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction ie not a forced transaction such as a liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date and is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability fair value measurement and disclosure guidance establishes a threelevel hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value notes and to the consolidated financial statements include information about the fair value hierarchy the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities as well as the valuation methodologies and key inputs used at december assets and liabilities measured using observable inputs that are classified as level or level represented percent and percent of total assets and liabilities recorded at fair value respectively valuations generated from modelbased techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market are considered level and reflect estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability f40 table of contents goodwill goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level equivalent to a business segment or one level below the corporation has three reporting units the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management at december goodwill totaled million including million allocated to the commercial bank million allocated to the retail bank and million allocated to wealth management the corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and may elect to perform a quantitative impairment analysis or first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine if a quantitative analysis is necessary additionally the corporation evaluates goodwill impairment on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired in the first quarter economic conditions deteriorated significantly with the spread of the coronavirus global pandemic the outbreak resulted in social distancing requirements throughout the world severely restricting the economy in response to the crisis the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate in march to close to zero additionally the us government initiated numerous measures to support the economy including the cares act given the economic deterioration in the first quarter of the corporation assessed whether the events and circumstances resulted in it being more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying value impairment indicators considered comprised economic conditions including projections of the duration of current conditions and timing of a potential recovery industry and market considerations government intervention and regulatory updates the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting units performance of the corporations stock and other relevant events the corporation further considered the amount by which fair value exceeded book value for each unit in the most recent quantitative analysis and sensitivities performed at the conclusion of the first quarter assessment the corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value in second quarter the corporation performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test in response to continued macroeconomic deterioration and the ongoing impacts to the banking industry and markets in which the corporation operates the estimated fair values of the reporting units were determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques the market approach and the income approach for the market approach valuations of reporting units considered a combination of earnings and equity multiples from companies with characteristics similar to each reporting unit since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests the valuations incorporated a control premium for the income approach estimated future cash flows were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit in the short and midterm forecasts incorporated current economic conditions and ongoing impacts of the global pandemic including a federal funds target near zero and an elevated allowance for credit losses longterm projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments as well as a longterm rate of return for each reporting unit projections were discounted using an applicable discount rate to calculate fair value the discount rate was based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit which incorporated the riskfree rate of return the level of nondiversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit a size risk premium and a market equity risk premium the discount rate further reflected the uncertainty of current economic conditions and potential impacts to the forecasted financial information the combined fair value of all units was compared to the corporations market capitalization for reasonableness at the conclusion of the quantitative impairment test in second quarter the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts including goodwill the annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of the beginning of third quarter the corporation assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount including goodwill qualitative factors included economic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance regulatory developments and performance of the corporations stock among other events and circumstances at the conclusion of the qualitative assessment in third quarter the corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value analyzing goodwill includes consideration of various factors that continue to rapidly evolve and for which significant uncertainty remains including the impact of the coronavirus global pandemic to the economy and ongoing government intervention to mitigate that impact further weakening in the economic environment such as continued decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in managements expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the corporations regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position f41 table of contents pension plan accounting the corporation has a qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan effective january benefits are calculated using a cash balance formula based on years of service age compensation and an interest credit based on the 30year treasury rate participants under age as of december are eligible to receive a frozen final average pay benefit in addition to amounts earned under the cash balance formula participants age or older as of december continue to be eligible for a final average pay benefit the corporation makes assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense the major assumptions are the discount rate used in determining the current benefit obligation the longterm rate of return expected on plan assets mix of assets within the portfolio and the projected mortality rate the discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the pension plans to a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date december the longterm rate of return expected on plan assets is set after considering both longterm returns in the general market and longterm returns experienced by the assets in the plan the current target asset allocation model for the plans is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements the expected returns on these various asset categories are blended to derive one longterm return assumption the assets are primarily invested in certain collective investment funds common stocks us treasury and other us government agency securities as well as corporate and municipal bonds and notes mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables published by thirdparties such as the society of actuaries considering other available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable sources the corporation reviews its pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with its actuarial consultants to determine if the assumptions are reasonable and adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations the major assumptions used to calculate defined benefit plan pension expense benefit were as follows discount rate longterm rate of return on plan assets mortality table base table a mortality improvement scale a a issued by the society of actuaries pri2012 mp2020 defined benefit plan benefit is expected to increase million to approximately million in compared to a benefit of million in this includes service cost expense of million and a benefit from other components of million service costs are included in salaries and benefits expense while the benefit from other components are included in other noninterest expenses on the consolidated statements of income changing the discount rate and longterm rate of return by basis points would impact defined benefit expense in by million and million respectively due to the longterm nature of pension plan assumptions actual results may differ significantly from the actuarialbased estimates differences resulting in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized to defined benefit pension expense in future years refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information income taxes the calculation of the corporations income tax provision and taxrelated accruals is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes deferred taxes arise from temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions currently or in the future and are included in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets the corporation assesses the relative risks and merits of tax positions for various transactions after considering statutes regulations judicial precedent and other available information and maintains tax accruals consistent with these assessments the corporation is subject to audit by taxing authorities that could question andor challenge the tax positions taken by the corporation included in net deferred taxes are deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences assumptions made regarding future events and when applicable state loss carryback capacity a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur due to changes in tax law interpretations of existing tax laws new judicial or regulatory guidance and the status of examinations conducted by taxing authorities that impact the relative risks and merits of tax positions taken by the corporation these changes when they occur impact the estimate of accrued taxes and f42 table of contents
