partially offset by a refund related to a favorable state tax ruling and lower operational losses strategic lines of business the corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities note to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the threemonth periods ended march and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines note to the consolidated financial statements in the corporations annual report describes the corporations segment reporting methodology net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp funding credits and charges the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the longterm value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities due to the longerterm nature of implied maturities ftp crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets as a result of applying matched funding interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds as well as the volume of deposits at the associated ftp crediting rates generally in periods of rising interest rates ftp charge rates for funding loans and ftp crediting rates on deposits will increase with ftp crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than ftp charge rates for funding loans business segments the following sections present a summary of the performance of each of the corporations business segments for the three months ended march compared to the same period

allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans march december allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonaccrual loans allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans the economic forecasts informing the current expected credit loss cecl model primarily reflected continued strong credit quality a tight labor market and strong demand for goods and services strong job and wage growth and pentup demand from consumers have supported growth in the broader us economy however there are increasing downside risks from recent bank failures inflationary pressures tighter monetary policy negotiations around the us federal debt ceiling and the slowing housing market foreign developments also pose continued headwinds including the impacts of the russiaukraine conflict the uncertain effects of chinas reopening on supply chains and inflationary pressures these factors shaped the 2year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the corporation in its cecl estimate at march the us economy is projected to contract modestly in second and third quarters before returning to growth in line with its longerrun average in oil prices are expected to remain elevated over the forecast period and the unemployment rate is projected to increase interest rates are projected to increase in second quarter followed by a gradual decline as the federal reserve calibrates monetary policy to reduce inflation corporate bond spreads are expected to reflect normalized default risk the following table summarizes select variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit losses estimate at march economic variable base forecast real gross domestic product gdp growth contracts modestly in second and third quarters before recovering to an average growth rate of percent in unemployment rate expected to increase to percent by second quarter then improve modestly through the remainder of the forecast period corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spreads spreads widen to percent by fourth quarter before normalizing to percent in oil prices prices steadily increase to over per barrel by third quarter followed by a gradual decline to per barrel by the end of the forecast period due to the high level of uncertainty regarding conditioning assumptions used as inputs to the forecast the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including more benign and more severe economic forecasts in a more severe scenario real gdp is projected to contract through second quarter subsequently improving to a growth rate of percent by the end of the forecast period other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of shortterm deterioration followed by a recovery selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses of approximately million as of march however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario the corporation monitors evolving economic conditions for impacts to the allowance for credit losses allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimates of current expected credit losses in the corporations loan portfolio pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually the allowance for loan losses increased million to million at march compared to million at december collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors designed to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools the allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for including adjustments for foresight risk input imprecisions and model imprecision credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and are based on one of several methods including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors determined in a manner similar to business loans multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk applied to commitment amounts for additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses refer to the critical

including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices liquidity risk represents the risk that the corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times the asset and liability policy committee alco of the corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities alco meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation including treasury finance economics lending deposit gathering and risk management corporate treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions the corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments such environments cover a series of scenarios including both idiosyncratic and marketwide in nature which vary in terms of duration and severity recent events have created greater uncertainty with respect to normal deposit patterns following the march banking industry disruption the corporation activated its contingency funding plan by increasing its cash position through wholesale funding channels and brokered deposits the corporations evaluation as of march projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations such as debt service dividend payments and normal operating expenses over a period of no less than months the corporation had liquid assets of billion on an unconsolidated basis at march corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at march was percent fixedrate percent overnight to 30day rate primarily bsby and sofr percent 90day and greater rates and percent prime the composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity the corporation is currently targeting low single digit net interest income at risk to a basis point gradual decline in interest rates since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a basecase net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model assumptions each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis model assumptions in the sensitivity scenarios at march included for the rising rate scenario a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances and for the declining rate scenario a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances in addition both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels an incremental interestbearing deposit beta of approximately no reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps the average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was billion for the three months ended march with an average yield of and effective duration of years the table below details components of the cash flow hedge portfolio at march cash flow hedges dollar amounts in millions notional amount weighted average yield years to maturity a swaps under contract at march b weighted average notional active per period full year full year full year a years to maturity calculated from a starting date of march b includes forward starting swaps of billion starting in and billion starting in excluding forward starting swaps the weighted average yield was the analysis also includes interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt and fhlb advances to variable rates through fair value hedges additionally included in this analysis are billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of basis points at march this basecase net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which shortterm rates rise or decline basis points with a floor of zero percent in a linear parallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average change of basis points over the period the table below as of march and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above estimated annual change march december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points basis points on average basis points on average declining basis points declining basis points basis points on average basis points on average sensitivity to declining interest rates decreased from december to march resulting from a decline in nonmaturity deposits sensitivity to rising interest rates at march projected lower interest income than the base case scenario due to nonmaturity deposit runoff and an increase in floatingrate wholesale funding at march an additional sensitivity scenario was added applying the rising basis point scenario assumptions with a incremental deposit beta relative to the base case scenario to assess the impact of the corporations deposit beta assumptions in this scenario net interest income decreased by million due to a more competitive deposit pricing environment all scenarios presented for march reflected a change in balance sheet composition following the march banking industry disruption as the balance sheet shifted to a higher concentration of cash as well as an increase in wholesale funding and brokered deposits which contributed to the decrease in net interest income in all scenarios presented sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel basis point shock with a floor of zero percent the table below as of march and december displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above march december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining basis points declining basis points the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates increased from december to march due to deposit runoff and a mix shift of funding sources sensitivity to declining rates increased the economic value of equity due to the same factors libor transition on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after effective march the fca confirmed that certain libor tenors will no longer be supported after december and that the remaining tenors including those most commonly used by the corporation will cease to be supported after june the corporation has substantial exposure to liborbased products including loans and derivatives and is prepared for the transition from libor toward alternative rates the corporation ceased originating liborbased products in the fourth quarter of and has since reduced total libor exposure by approximately percent to billion substantially all of the corporations libor exposure is comprised of loans swaps and options of the remaining liborbased products percent required no further remediation because the instruments mature prior to cessation or include fallback language as of march there were approximately billion of liborbased loans compared to billion at december of these approximately percent have maturity dates prior to cessation percent mature after cessation but have fallback language and the remaining percent are in process of remediation the corporation is confident it will complete its remediation efforts in a timely manner in addition to remediation activity on liborbased loans the corporation has enacted the international swaps and derivatives association isda protocols which relates to billion of derivatives once events occur that trigger a fallback the reference rate for the variable leg of the swap will fall back from libor to the isda fallback rate which is the daily sofr plus a spread the corporations enterprise transition timelines are closely aligned with recommendations from the alternative reference rates committee for both best practices and recommended objectives the corporation will continue to align with industry and regulatory guidelines regarding the cessation of libor as well as monitor market developments for alternative reference rates for a discussion of the various risks facing the corporation in relation to the transition away from libor see the market risk discussion within item risk factors beginning on page of the corporations annual report sources of liquidity the
