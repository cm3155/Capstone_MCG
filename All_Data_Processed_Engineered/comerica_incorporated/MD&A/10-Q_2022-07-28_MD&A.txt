of corporate facilities and optimization of technology platform strategic lines of business the corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities note to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the three and sixmonth periods ended june and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines note to the consolidated financial statements in the corporations annual report describes the corporations segment reporting methodology net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the longterm value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities due to the longerterm nature of implied maturities ftp crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets as a result of applying matched funding interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds as well as the volume of deposits at the associated ftp crediting rates generally in periods of rising interest rates ftp charge rates for funding loans and ftp crediting rates on deposits will increase with ftp crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than ftp charge rates for funding loans business segments the following sections

since the inception of the share repurchase program in a total of million shares have been authorized for repurchase there is no expiration date for the share repurchase program the timing and actual

assets a a june capital riskweighted assets and ratios are estimated b see supplemental financial data section for reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and regulatory ratios the common shareholders equity ratio decreased basis points to percent at june primarily due to the change in unrealized losses in the corporations securities portfolio and to a lesser extent its cash flow hedge portfolio the unrealized losses in the corporations availableforsale security portfolio are due to market valuations since the time of initial acquisition which in substantially all cases are not expected to be realized the tangible common equity ratio which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets decreased basis points to percent for the same reasons the impact of cumulative unrealized losses recorded within other comprehensive loss at june to both ratios was approximately basis points risk management the following updated information should be read in conjunction with the risk management section on pages f17 through f33 in the corporations annual report credit risk allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses decreased million from million at december to million at june as a percentage of total loans the allowance for credit losses was percent at june compared to percent at december the allowance for credit losses covered times total nonperforming loans at june and december the economic forecasts informing the current expected credit loss cecl model primarily reflected strong credit quality and strengthening of the labor markets in the first half of excess savings and pentup demand from consumers as well as robust labor markets have supported growth in the broader us economy however there are increasing downside risks from the impacts of the russiaukraine conflict chinas lockdowns and supply chain issues the slowing housing market future monetary and fiscal policy actions and inflationary pressures these factors shaped the 2year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the corporation in its cecl estimate at june the us economy is expected to continue to grow with the pace of expansion declining in before returning to longterm growth rates in certain economic variables like oil prices are expected to normalize over the forecast period while others like the unemployment rate are projected to remain at current levels interest rates are forecasted to increase reflecting the federal reserves expectations while corporate bond spreads are expected to reflect normalized default risk the following table summarizes select economic variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit losses estimate at june economic variable base forecast real gross domestic product gdp growth growth above percent in third quarter subsequently declining to under percent by second quarter before returning to a longterm growth rate by first quarter unemployment rate stable between percent and percent throughout forecast period corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spreads reflect a normalized level of default risk oil prices prices steadily decline from current levels to below per barrel by the end of the forecast period due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including more benign and more severe economic forecasts in a more severe scenario real gdp is expected to contract through third quarter subsequently improving to a growth rate of percent by the end of the forecast period other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of shortterm contractions followed by a recovery selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses by approximately million as of june however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimates of current expected credit losses in the corporations loan portfolio pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors designed to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools the allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for including adjustments for foresight risk input imprecisions and model imprecision credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs and are based on one of several methods including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors determined in a manner similar to business loans multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk applied to commitment amounts the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments increased million to million at june compared to million at december the following table presents metrics of the allowance for credit losses and

represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices liquidity risk represents the risk that the corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times the asset and liability policy committee alco of the corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities alco meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation including treasury finance economics lending deposit gathering and risk management corporate treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions the corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments such environments cover a series of scenarios including both idiosyncratic and marketwide in nature which vary in terms of duration and severity the evaluation as of june projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations over a period of no less than months the corporation had liquid assets of billion on an unconsolidated basis at june corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting of the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at june was percent 30day or less rate primarily libor and bsby percent fixedrate percent prime and percent comprised of 90day and greater rates included in the above loan composition metrics percent of total loans had nonzero interest rate floors protecting against future rate declines the composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity based on the current rate environment and balance sheet composition the corporation anticipates it will continue to add fixedrate assets primarily interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk within acceptable risk levels by reducing its sensitivity to rate movements and specifically to protect against declining rates since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a basecase net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment model assumptions in this base case at june included a modest increase in loan balances loan spreads held at current levels a moderate decrease in deposit balances with an interestbearing deposit beta of approximately securities portfolio held at current level and no additions to interest swaps modeled the average balance of the securities portfolio was billion for the three months ended june with an average yield of during the second quarter of the corporation purchased billion in mortgagebacked securities with an average yield of and effective duration of years at june the effective duration of the entire securities portfolio was years the table below details components of the cash flow hedge portfolio at june cash flow hedges dollar amounts in millions notional amount weighted average yield years to maturity a swaps under contract at june b weighted average notional active per period first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year full year a years to maturity calculated from a starting date of june b includes forward starting swaps of billion starting in third quarter billion starting in fourth quarter and billion starting after fourth quarter excluding forward starting swaps the weighted average yield was additionally as of july billion of cash flow hedges with a weighted average yield of and an average initial term of years were entered into in the third quarter of with start dates in october these third quarter hedges are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis the analysis also includes interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt to variable rates through fair value hedges additionally included in this analysis are billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of basis points at june this basecase net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which shortterm rates rise or decline basis points with a floor of zero percent in a linear parallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average change of basis points over the period each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior yield curve changes loan and deposit pricing and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis the table below as of june and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above estimated annual change june december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points basis points on average basis points on average declining basis points declining to zero percent sensitivity to declining interest rates increased from december to june primarily due to the may and june increases in fed funds to basis points allowing for a full basis point repricing of the balance sheet this was partially offset by additional cash flow hedges and investment securities added in and nonmaturity deposit runoff sensitivity to rising interest rates decreased due to increased cash flow hedges and nonmaturity deposit runoff but was partially offset by the increased repricing potential of floatingrate loans as they moved above their contractual floor rates sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel basis point shock with a floor of zero percent the table below as of june and december displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above june december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining basis points declining to zero percent the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates changed from an increase as of december to a reduction as of june due to the additional cash flow hedges growth of the securities portfolio and deposit runoff sensitivity to declining rates now increases economic value of equity due to the same factors libor transition on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after effective march the fca confirmed that certain libor tenors will no longer be supported after december and that the remaining tenors including those most commonly used by the corporation will cease to be supported after june the corporation has substantial exposure to liborbased products including loans and derivatives and is preparing for a transition from libor toward alternative rates as of july the corporation was operationally ready to issue new secured overnight financing rate sofrbased cash and derivative products additionally as of september the corporation was operationally ready to issue new bloomberg shortterm bank yield index bsbybased cash and derivative products the corporation ceased originating liborbased products in the fourth quarter of as of june the corporation estimates that approximately percent of its liborbased commercial loans have maturity dates prior to the cessation of libor of the remaining loans with maturity dates beyond the cessation date the corporation estimates that percent incorporate fallback language and is confident that it will achieve timely remediation of all other loans cessation planning for consumer loans is in process as the corporation has completed a review of the fallback terms for residential adjustablerate mortgages and identified alternate benchmarks for other smaller portfolio segments communications and learning activities to support customers and colleagues are ongoing in addition to remediation activity on liborbased loans the corporation has enacted the international swaps and derivatives association isda protocols related to derivatives once events occur that trigger a fallback the reference rate for the variable leg of the swap will fall back from libor to the isda fallback rate which is the daily sofr plus a spread the corporations enterprise transition timelines are closely aligned with recommendations from the alternative reference rates committee for both best practices and recommended objectives the corporation will continue to align with industry and regulatory guidelines regarding the cessation of libor as well as monitor market developments for transitioning to alternative reference rates for a discussion of the various risks facing the corporation in relation to the transition away from libor see the market risk discussion within item risk factors beginning on page of the corporations annual report on form 10k for the year ended december sources of liquidity the corporation maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations while taking into account potential commitment draws and deposit runoff that may occur in the normal course of business the majority of the corporations balance sheet is funded by customer deposits cash flows from loan repayments increases in deposit accounts activity in the securities portfolio and the purchased funds market serve as the corporations primary liquidity sources the corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources the corporation had access to liquid assets of billion and billion at june and december respectively which included cash on deposit with the federal reserve and the portion of the investment securities portfolio that the corporation can sell without thirdparty consent in addition the corporation may access external funding sources when necessary which include fhlb advances federal funds reverse repurchase agreements brokered deposits and corporationissued bonds the corporation maintains a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission from
