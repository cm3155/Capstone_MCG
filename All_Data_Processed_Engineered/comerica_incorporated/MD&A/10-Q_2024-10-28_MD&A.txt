partially offset by gains on the sale of real estate recorded in the period strategic lines of business the corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities note to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the three and ninemonth periods ended september and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines note to the consolidated financial statements in the corporations annual report describes the corporations segment reporting methodology net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp funding credits and charges the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the longterm value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities due to the longerterm nature of implied maturities ftp crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets as a result of applying matched funding interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds as well as the volume of deposits at the associated ftp crediting rates generally in periods of rising interest rates ftp charge rates for funding loans and ftp crediting rates on deposits will increase with ftp crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than ftp charge rates for funding loans conversely in periods of declining interest rates ftp charge rates for funding loans and ftp crediting rates on deposits will decrease with ftp crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than ftp charge rates for funding loans business segments the following sections present a summary of

for the three months ended september was billion and respectively compared to billion and respectively for the three months ended december basel iii endgame framework on july the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking commonly referred to as basel iii endgame the capital proposal that would significantly increase the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations with total assets of billion or more the capital proposal would align the regulatory capital calculation and the calculation of riskweighted assets across large banking organizations subject to the capital proposal and require category iii and iv banking organizations to include most components of aoci including net unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities in their regulatory capital ratios the capital proposal was subject to a public comment period which ended on january if adopted as proposed the capital proposal would include a threeyear transition period beginning july as of september the corporation had total assets of billion while the capital proposal would not apply to the corporation as it is currently proposed if the corporation becomes subject to the requirements of the capital proposal in the future or becomes subject to any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity such requirements could limit the corporations ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital which would have a material adverse effect on the corporations financial condition and results of operations if subject to the capital proposal the estimated impact related to proposed inclusion of most components of aoci would be an approximate basis point decrease to common equity tier1 capital based on september financials risk management the following updated information should be read in conjunction with the risk management section on pages f18 through f34 in the corporations annual report credit risk allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses decreased million from million at december to million at september the following table presents metrics of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans september december allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans the economic forecasts informing the current expected credit loss cecl model reflects the frbs pivot to monetary policy recalibration and lower interest rates consumer spending growth moderation and slower albeit continued growth of the real economy inflation is gradually moderating as a modest margin of slack capacity opens in the labor market energy prices are projected to level off despite continued crosswinds from the russiaukraine and mideast wars as us crude production holds near a record high residential real estate property prices are expected to rise at more moderate rates while commercial real estate prices face headwinds both reflecting the long and variable lags of the frbs tighter monetary policy prior to the beginning of rate cuts in the third quarter of downside risks to growth from geopolitical risks costofliving pressures on household finances and less expansionary fiscal policy are projected to collectively contribute to slower growth in and reduced demand for office space and subdued economic activity in the central business districts of major metro areas persist as drags on the broader economy the frbs gradual rate cuts driven by a softening labor market and disinflation aim to contain the risk of recession these factors shaped the 2year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the corporation in its cecl estimate at september the us economy is projected to grow at a belowtrend rate through and before gradually normalizing to its trend growth rate the unemployment rate is expected to hold below percent and oil prices are expected to decline while interest rate forecasts reflect market expectations and guidance from the frb available during the third quarter of the following table summarizes select variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the cecl estimate at september economic variable base forecast real gross domestic product gdp growth growth slows to percent in the fourth quarter before recovering to approximately percent by the end of the forecast period unemployment rate expected to hold at approximately percent through fourth quarter followed by a modest decline in to percent by the end of the forecast period spread of corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spread widens to percent during second half of before normalizing to approximately percent by third quarter oil prices prices generally decline from per barrel to approximately per barrel over the forecast period due to the high level of uncertainty regarding assumptions used as inputs to the forecast the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including more benign and more severe economic forecasts in a more severe scenario real gdp is projected to contract through the second quarter subsequently recovering growth of percent by the end of the forecast period oil prices fall to below per barrel by first quarter followed by an increase to per barrel by the end of the forecast period while the unemployment rate remains elevated through the end of the forecast period selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses of approximately million as of september however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario the corporation monitors evolving economic conditions for impacts to the allowance for credit losses allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimates of current expected credit losses in the corporations loan portfolio the allowance for loan losses which totaled million at september was relatively stable compared to million at december collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors designed to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools the allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for including adjustments for foresight risk input imprecisions and model imprecision credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and are based on one of several methods including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors determined in a manner similar to business loans multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk applied to commitment amounts the allowance for

to help mitigate the risk associated with these loans the corporation focuses on middle market companies with highly capable management teams strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance industries prone to cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants during the underwriting process cash flows are stresstested to evaluate the borrowers abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates the fdic defines higherrisk commercial and industrial hr ci loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt to earnings before

market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices liquidity risk represents the risk that the corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times the asset liability management committee alco of the corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities alco meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation including treasury finance economics lending deposit gathering and risk management corporate treasury helps mitigate market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions the corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments such environments cover a series of scenarios including both idiosyncratic and marketwide in nature which vary in terms of duration and severity the corporations evaluation as of september projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations such as debt service dividend payments and normal operating expenses over a period of no less than months the corporation had liquid assets of billion on an unconsolidated basis at september corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting of the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at september was percent fixedrate percent overnight to 30day rate percent 90day and greater rates and percent prime the composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a basecase net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model assumptions each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns additionally the analysis assumes that all loan hedges qualify for hedge accounting changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis model assumptions in the sensitivity scenarios at september included for the rising rate scenarios a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances and for the declining rate scenarios a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances in addition both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels an incremental interestbearing deposit beta of approximately deposit mix shifts based on historical observations partial reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps the average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was billion for the three months ended september with an average yield of and effective duration of years the table below details components of the variablerate loan

cessation section for more information the analysis also includes interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt and fhlb advances to variable rates through fair value hedges additionally included in this analysis are billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of basis points at september this basecase net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which shortterm rates rise or decline or basis points with a floor of zero percent in a linear nonparallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average change of or basis points over the period the table below as of september and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case

sensitivity to both rising and declining interest rates decreased from december to september due to changes in balance sheet mix dynamics at september additional sensitivity scenarios applied the rising and declining basis point scenario assumptions with a incremental deposit beta relative to the base case scenario to assess the impact of the corporations deposit beta assumptions in these rising and declining scenarios net interest income decreased by million and increased by million respectively due to a more rapid repricing pace compared to the standard model assumptions sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel or basis point shock with a floor of zero percent the table below

services limited bloomberg announced that it will discontinue publishing bsby on november accordingly the corporation was required to dedesignate billion of interest rate swaps used in cash flow hedges of certain bsbyindexed loans and reclassify amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings for each dedesignated swap settlement of interest payments and changes in fair value were recorded as risk management hedging losses within other noninterest income instead of net interest income until redesignation all impacted swaps were redesignated as of april bsby cessation negatively impacted interest income on commercial loans by million for the three months ended september compared to million for the three months ended june refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of redesignated interest rate hedges at september the corporation had billion of exposure to bsbybased products including billion in loans and billion in interest rate swaps the corporation ceased originating bsbybased products and is working to convert bsbybased loans to other indices as repricing opportunities occur the corporation expects any bsbybased contracts that do not organically transition to sofr by november will transition to sofr through existing fallback language which for loans is the first repricing date after bsby cessation occurs in november for interest rate swaps the corporation plans to enact the international swaps and derivatives association isda definition and benchmark supplement language as applicable in the third quarter of as part of the transition from bsby to sofr the cme converted existing bsby swaps into two swaps a shortdated bsby swap bridge swap and a forward starting sofr swap surviving swap the two swaps are designed to cover the same period of time as the original bsby swap as a result of this approach the conversion resulted in a temporary billion increase in notional balances when compared to the former bsbybased swaps cleared through the cme which consisted of billion in cash flow swaps and billion in customerinitiated swaps this temporary increase in notional amounts due to the bridge swaps is expected to resolve in the fourth quarter of sources of liquidity the corporation maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations while taking into account potential commitment draws and deposit runoff that may occur in the normal course of business the majority of the corporations balance sheet is funded by customer deposits cash flows from loan repayments increases in deposit accounts including brokered deposits activity in the securities portfolio and wholesale funding channels serve as the corporations primary liquidity sources the corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources available liquidity includes cash fhlb advances and frb borrowing through the discount window as well as the market value of unencumbered investment securities which if needed could be utilized as collateral for fhlb advances and frb borrowings the corporation has pledged a
