and the payment of covid19related stipends strategic lines of business and markets the corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities market segment results are also provided for the corporations three primary geographic markets michigan california and texas in addition to the three primary geographic markets other markets is also reported as a market segment note to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business and market segments for the three and sixmonth periods ended june and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines note to the consolidated financial statements in the corporations annual report describes the corporations segment reporting methodology net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates for deposits and other funds provided reflect the longterm value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume and associated ftp impacts of loan and deposit levels as overall interest rates decreased business segments particularly those focused on generating deposits were impacted by lower ftp crediting rates on deposits in the six months ended june compared to the same period in the prior year similarly ftp charges for funding loans

prepared to continue using capital and liquidity in a responsible way to assist customers impacted by the covid19 crisis with a target of attaining and maintaining a common equity tier cet1 capital ratio of approximately percent at june the corporations estimated cet1 capital ratio was percent a decrease of thousand basis points compared to december in the corporation elected regulatory relief to defer the impact of adopting the cecl model for measuring credit losses on regulatory capital which resulted in a cumulative 13basispoint benefit to the estimated cet1 capital ratio at june also in the corporation adopted capital rules issued by federal banking agencies that simplified certain regulatory capital rules including the capital treatment of mortgage servicing assets certain deferred

management the following updated information should be read in conjunction with the risk management section on pages f20 through f33 in the corporations annual report credit risk allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments effective january the allowance for credit losses reflected the adoption of topic which requires companies to estimate credit losses using the cecl framework as a percentage of total loans the allowance for credit losses was percent at june compared to percent at december excluding billion in ppp loans which are guaranteed by the small business administration the allowance for credit losses was percent of total loans at june the allowance for credit losses covered times and times total nonperforming loans at june and december respectively at adoption on january the scope and severity of the economic crisis resulting from the eventual covid19 pandemic were unknown as such the economic scenario used by the corporation to develop its estimate of cecl as of the adoption date reflected a continued moderate us economic expansion compared to levels and a stable interest rate environment with the federal funds rate remaining in the to 175percent range other assumptions included resolution of trade tensions a calmer global economy and a strong us dollar all of which supported modest industrial production growth and stable oil prices the economic scenario also assumed strong labor market conditions to support the consumer sector management also considered the level of uncertainty regarding its economic assumptions as part of the qualitative adjustment the adoption of cecl resulted in a million dayone decrease in the allowance for credit losses from million at december under the incurred loss model see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the adoption of cecl the allowance for credit losses increased by million from adoption date to billion at june primarily reflecting the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the response by domestic and global governmental authorities including quarantines and other social distancing policies aimed at fighting the spread of the virus energy markets which were experiencing already reduced capital market activity prior to the pandemic showed continued stress through the first half of the us economy contracted into a recession with unusual speed and force ending the longest expansionary period in us history the us government and the federal reserve responded to the pandemic with unprecedented measures in addition to the federal reserve reducing the target federal funds rate to zero to percent congress passed the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act that included an estimated trillion stimulus package during second quarter states across the us began loosening social distancing policies stimulating economic activity while economic conditions showed signs of improvement toward the end of the second quarter there continues to be uncertainty regarding the impact to the us economy from a secondary wave of covid19 cases as jurisdictions begin to reopen across the country and the mitigating impacts of government intervention these developments shaped the 2year reasonable and supportable forecast used by the corporation in its calculation of the cecl estimate at june after a sharp decline in gdp in second quarter the forecast reflects growth through the end of normalizing to historical growth rates by the end of the forecast period forecasts for other key economic variables including the unemployment rate oil prices and industrial production levels are generally in line with gdp projections interest rates remain low reflecting the federal reserves expectation that rates will remain at current levels in the nearto midterm while corporate bond rates reflect decreasing default risk as the economy recovers the following table summarizes the forecasts for the economic variables most impactful to the allowance for credit losses estimate at june economic variable base forecast real gdp growth grows by percent in third quarter normalizing into a longterm growth rate of percent by the end of the forecast period unemployment rate remaining above percent through third quarter gradually decreasing to percent by the end of the forecast period corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spreads third quarter spread of percent reflects residual impacts of economic uncertainty followed by a sharp shortterm decline then normalizing to a rate of percent by the end of the forecast period oil prices prices below per barrel in third quarter increase in line with gdp through the forecast period stabilizing at per barrel by first quarter due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate economic consequences of the pandemic as well as the effectiveness of the governments stimulus packages management also considered other economic scenarios to make appropriate qualitative adjustments for certain sectors of its lending portfolio including more benign and more severe forecasts allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimates of current expected credit losses in the corporations loan portfolio pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors designed to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools the allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for including adjustments for foresight risk input imprecisions and model imprecision credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as tdrs and are based on one of several methods including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows as a percentage of total loans the allowance for loan losses was percent at june compared to percent at december excluding ppp loans the allowance for loan losses was percent of total loans at june the allocation of reserves for energy loans remains above percent in response to sustained pressures on the energy portfolio nonperforming loans were percent of total loans at june compared to percent at december and the allowance covered times and times total nonperforming loans at june and december respectively allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve

treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established limits for the minimum number of months into the future in which the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos liquidity policy requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and debt obligations with a target of months but no less than months corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting of the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at june was percent 30day libor percent other libor primarily 60and 90day percent prime and percent fixed rate this creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a basecase net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes as of the balance sheet dates are included in the analysis but no additional hedging is forecasted at june these derivative instruments comprise interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt to variable rates through fair value hedges and convert billion of variablerate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges this basecase net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline basis points with a floor of zero percent in a linear nonparallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of basis points over the period each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior yield curve changes loan and deposit pricing and overall balance sheet mix and growth in this low rate environment depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends as a result the rising rate scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than experienced historically as rates rise changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis the table below as of june and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above june december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining to zero percent declining basis points the change in sensitivity to interest rates from december to june was driven by growth in fixedrate loans as well as the addition of swaps converting variablerate loans to fixed rates partially offset by growth in core deposits also decreased sensitivity to declining interest rates was related to limited downward movement in interest rates before hitting zero percent sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel basis point shock the table below as of june and december displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above june december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining to zero percent declining basis points the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates increased from december to june due to changes in deposit pay rates and expected lives the sensitivity to declining rates decreased due to changes in balance sheet composition as well as limited remaining downward movement in rates before hitting modeled zeropercent floors libor transition on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop

the most significant of which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the corporations annual report these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations changes in underlying factors assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the corporations future financial condition and results of operations at december the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses fair value measurement goodwill pension plan accounting and income taxes these policies were reviewed with the audit committee of the corporations board of directors and are discussed more fully on pages f34 through f36 in the corporations annual report below are significant changes to the corporations critical accounting policies or estimates since the corporations annual report allowance for credit losses the corporation adopted new accounting guidance for estimating credit losses known as the cecl framework in first quarter in accordance with cecl the allowance for credit losses which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve for current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the portfolio in determining the allowance for credit losses for the majority of its lending portfolio the corporation uses reserve factors based on estimated probability of default for internal risk ratings and loss given default management applies reserve factors to pools of loans and lendingrelated commitments with similar risk characteristics calibrates these factors using economic forecasts and incorporates qualitative adjustments for further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the economic forecast incorporated into the second quarter model refer to the risk management section of this report managements determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio lendingrelated commitments current as well as forecasted economic factors and other relevant factors the calculation is inherently subjective and requires management to exercise significant judgment in developing assumptions into the estimate the most significant of which are the loan risk rating process development of economic forecasts and application of qualitative adjustments sensitivities are disclosed to demonstrate how changes in loan risk ratings and economic forecast scenarios may impact the allowance for credit losses sensitivities only consider changes to each specific assumption in isolation and their impact to the quantitative modeled results however they do not contemplate impacts to the qualitative framework loan risk rating process loss factors are applied to pools of loans based on the corporations internal risk rating system therefore loss estimates are highly dependent on the accuracy of the risk rating assigned to each loan the inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning andor entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system is monitored by the corporations asset quality review function changes to internal risk ratings beyond the forecasted migration inherent in the credit models would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses to illustrate if five percent of the individual risk ratings were adjusted down by one rating across all pools the allowance for loan losses as of june would change by approximately million forecasted economic variables historical loss factor estimates are calibrated to economic forecasts over the reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the projected performance of specific economic variables that statistically correlate with the probability of default and loss given default pools loss estimates revert to historical loss experience for contractual lives beyond the forecast period management selects economic variables it believes to be most relevant based on the composition of the loan portfolio and customer base including forecasted levels of employment gross domestic product corporate bond and treasury spreads industrial production levels consumer and commercial real estate price indices as well as housing statistics the allowance for credit losses is highly sensitive to the economic forecasts used to develop the estimate due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions such as the ultimate impact of the global pandemic and effectiveness of the government stimulus the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including a more severe economic forecast scenario with varying speeds of recovery the following table summarizes the more severe forecast scenario for the economic variables that are most impactful economic variable more severe forecast real gdp growth grows by percent in third quarter followed by a shortterm contraction then reaches a growth rate of percent as the forecast period ends partway through an economic recovery unemployment rate remains at elevated levels between percent and percent throughout the forecast period corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spreads remains between percent and percent in the nearterm before normalizing into spreads below percent by the end of the forecast period oil prices price remains low throughout the forecast period improving to above per barrel by the second quarter selecting a different forecast in the current environment could result in significantly different estimated allowance for credit losses to illustrate absent model overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process if the corporation selected the more severe scenario to inform its models the allowance for credit losses as of june would increase by approximately billion however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario qualitative adjustments the corporation includes qualitative adjustments as appropriate intended to capture the impact of uncertainties not reflected in the quantitative estimate including foresight risk model imprecisions and input imprecisions qualitative adjustments for foresight risk reflect the inherent imprecision in economic forecasts and may be included based on managements evaluation of different forecast scenarios ranging from more benign to more severe and known recent events impacting the corporations portfolio model imprecision adjustments and model overlays may be included to mitigate known limitations in the quantitative models input imprecision includes adjustments for portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter risk ratings once evidence is acquired as well as a qualitative assessment of the lending environment including underwriting standards current economic and political conditions and other factors affecting credit quality qualitative reserves at june primarily included adjustments for uncertainties related to forecasted economic variables and model imprecision other considerations to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods the allowance is assigned to business segments and any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from management estimates would primarily affect the commercial bank segment goodwill goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level equivalent to a business segment or one level below the corporation has three reporting units the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management at june goodwill totaled million including million allocated to the commercial bank million allocated to the retail bank and million allocated to wealth management the corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and may elect to perform a quantitative impairment analysis or first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine if a quantitative analysis is necessary additionally the corporation evaluates goodwill impairment on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired in the first quarter of economic conditions deteriorated significantly with the spread of the coronavirus global pandemic the outbreak resulted in social distancing requirements throughout the world severely restricting the economy in response to the crisis the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate in march to close to zero additionally the us government initiated numerous measures to support the economy including the cares act given the economic deterioration in the first quarter of the corporation assessed whether the events and circumstances resulted in it being more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying value impairment indicators considered comprised economic conditions including projections of the duration of current conditions and timing of a potential recovery industry and market considerations government intervention and regulatory updates the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting units performance of the corporations stock and other relevant events the corporation further considered the amount by which fair value exceeded book value for each unit in the most recent quantitative analysis and sensitivities performed at the conclusion of the first quarter assessment the corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value in second quarter the corporation performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test in response to continued macroeconomic deterioration and the ongoing impacts to the banking industry and markets in which the corporation operates the estimated fair values of the reporting units were determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques the market approach and the income approach for the market approach valuations of reporting units considered a combination of earnings and equity multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests the valuations incorporated a control premium for the income approach estimated future cash flows were derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit in the short and midterm forecasts incorporated current economic conditions and ongoing impacts of the global pandemic including a federal funds target near zero and an elevated allowance for credit losses longterm projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments as well as a longterm rate of return for each reporting unit projections were discounted using an applicable discount rate to calculate fair value the discount rate was based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit which incorporates the riskfree rate of return the level of nondiversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit a size risk premium and a market equity risk premium the discount rate further reflected the uncertainty of current economic conditions and potential impacts to the forecasted financial information the combined fair value of all units was compared to the corporations market capitalization for reasonableness at the conclusion of the quantitative impairment test in second quarter the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts including goodwill the test included evaluation of various factors that continue to rapidly evolve and for which significant uncertainty remains including the impact of the coronavirus global pandemic to the economy and ongoing government intervention to mitigate that impact further weakening in the economic environment such as continued decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in managements expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the corporations regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position
