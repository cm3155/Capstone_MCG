lines of business the corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities note to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the three and sixmonth periods ended june and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines note to the consolidated financial statements in the corporations annual report describes the corporations segment reporting methodology net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp funding credits and charges the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the longterm value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities due to the longerterm nature of implied maturities ftp crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets as a result of applying matched funding interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds as well as the volume of deposits at the associated ftp crediting rates generally in periods of rising interest rates ftp charge rates for funding loans and ftp crediting rates on deposits will increase with ftp crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than ftp charge rates for funding loans business segments the following sections present a summary of the performance of each

allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans the economic forecasts informing the current expected credit loss cecl model project a further slowdown in the pace of economic activity in the second half of as the cumulative effects of the federal reserves tighter monetary policy since early flow through to the real economy consumer spending is projected to slow as the support from pandemicera savings dissipates high inflation curbs discretionary spending and student loan payments restart causing employers to slow the pace of hiring energy prices are projected to rise as the ongoing russiaukraine conflict and chinas reopening tighten the global balance of petroleum supply and demand residential and commercial real estate property prices are projected to decline modestly as the long and variable lags of the feds tighter monetary policy act as headwinds to asset prices these factors shaped the 2year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the corporation in its cecl estimate at june the us economy is projected to contract modestly in third and fourth quarters before returning to growth in in line with expectations for its longerrun average similarly inflation is forecasted to converge toward the federal reserves target over the 2year period interest rates are projected to increase in third quarter followed by a gradual decline as inflation slows and the federal reserve gradually shifts to a less restrictive monetary stance the following table summarizes select variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the cecl estimate at june economic variable base forecast real gross domestic product gdp growth contracts modestly in third and fourth quarters before recovering to a growth rate between percent and percent by the end of the forecast period unemployment rate expected to increase to percent by first quarter and maintain such levels before a slight decline in corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spreads spreads widen to percent by fourth quarter before normalizing to percent by mid oil prices prices remain between and per barrel throughout the forecast period due to the high level of uncertainty regarding conditioning assumptions used as inputs to the forecast the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including more benign and more severe economic forecasts in a more severe scenario real gdp is projected to contract through third quarter subsequently improving to a growth rate of percent by the end of the forecast period other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of shortterm deterioration followed by a recovery except for unemployment levels which remained elevated through the forecast period selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses of approximately million as of june however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario the corporation monitors evolving economic conditions for impacts to the allowance for credit losses allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimates of current expected credit losses in the corporations loan portfolio pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually the allowance for loan losses increased million to million at june compared to million at december collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors designed to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools the allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for including adjustments for foresight risk input imprecisions and model imprecision credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and are based on one of several methods including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors determined in a manner similar to business loans multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk

equity prices liquidity risk represents the risk that the corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times the asset and liability policy committee alco of the corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities alco meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation including treasury finance economics lending deposit gathering and risk management corporate treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions the corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments such environments cover a series of scenarios including both idiosyncratic and marketwide in nature which vary in terms of duration and severity recent events have created greater uncertainty with respect to normal deposit patterns following the march banking industry disruption the corporation activated its contingency funding plan by increasing its cash position through wholesale funding channels and brokered deposits the corporations evaluation as of june projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations such as debt service dividend payments and normal operating expenses over a period of no less than months the corporation had liquid assets of billion on an unconsolidated basis at june corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at june was percent fixedrate percent overnight to 30day rate primarily bsby and sofr percent 90day and greater rates and percent prime the composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity currently from an interest rate risk management perspective the corporation is approximately neutral to basis point gradual interest rate changes since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a basecase net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model assumptions each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis model assumptions in the sensitivity scenarios at june included for the rising rate scenario a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances and for the declining rate scenario a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances in addition both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels an incremental interestbearing deposit beta of approximately no reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps the average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was billion for the three months ended june with an average yield of and effective duration of years the table below details components of the cash flow hedge portfolio at june cash flow hedges dollar amounts in millions notional amount weighted average yield years to maturity a swaps under contract at june b swaps under contract at june excluding bridge swaps with the cme c weighted average notional active per period

swaps the weighted average yield was c excludes billion of bridge swaps used for libor transition purposes by the cme see libor transition section for more information the analysis also includes interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt and fhlb advances to variable rates through fair value hedges additionally included in this analysis are billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of basis points at june this basecase net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which shortterm rates rise or decline basis points with a floor of zero percent in a linear parallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average change of basis points over the period the table below as of june and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above estimated annual change june december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points basis points on average basis points on average declining basis points declining basis points basis points on average basis points on average sensitivity to declining interest rates decreased from december to june resulting from a decline in nonmaturity deposits partially offset by an increase in brokered deposits sensitivity to rising interest rates at june projected lower interest income than the base case scenario due to nonmaturity deposit runoff partially offset by an increase in fixedrate certificates of deposit primarily brokered deposits at june additional sensitivity scenarios were added applying the rising and declining basis point scenario assumptions with a incremental deposit beta relative to the base case scenario to assess the impact of the corporations deposit beta assumptions in these rising and declining scenarios net interest income decreased by million and increased by million respectively due to a more rapid repricing pace compared to the standard model assumptions all scenarios presented for june reflected a change in balance sheet composition following the march banking industry disruption as the balance sheet maintained a higher concentration of cash as well as increased wholesale funding and brokered deposits which contributed to the decrease in net interest income in all scenarios presented sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel basis point shock with a floor of zero percent the table below as of june and december displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above june december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining basis points declining basis points the negative sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates increased from december to june due to deposit runoff partially offset by a declining notional amount of cash flow swaps excluding the impact of bridge swaps used for libor transition purposes and a smaller securities portfolio sensitivity to declining rates increased the economic value of equity due to the same factors libor transition on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after effective march the fca confirmed that certain libor tenors would no longer be supported after december and that the remaining tenors including those most commonly used by the corporation would no longer be supported after june the corporation had substantial exposure to liborbased products ceased originating liborbased products in the fourth quarter and has worked to remediate its outstanding libor contracts as of june substantially all of the corporations libor exposure was remediated and remaining liborbased contracts are expected to transition to other reference rates in early third quarter in the second quarter as part of the libor transition the chicago mercantile exchange cme converted existing libor swaps into two swaps a shortdated libor swap bridge swap and a forward starting sofr swap surviving swap the two swaps are designed to cover the same period of time as the original libor swap as a result of this approach the conversion resulted in a temporary increase in notional balances when compared to the former liborbased swaps cleared through the cme the corporations swap notional increased by approximately billion billion and billion for cash flow fair value and customerinitiated swaps respectively the temporary increase in notional amounts due to the bridge swaps is expected to end in third quarter for a discussion of the various risks facing the corporation in relation to the transition away from libor see the market risk discussion within item risk factors beginning on page of
