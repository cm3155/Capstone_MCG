credit risk is found in all activities where success depends on counterparty issuer or borrower performance it arises any time funds are extended committed invested or otherwise exposed whether reflected on or off the balance sheet the governance structure is administered through the strategic credit committee the strategic credit committee is chaired by the chief credit officer and approves recommendations to address credit risk matters through credit policy credit risk management practices and required credit risk actions the strategic credit committee also ensures a comprehensive reporting of credit risk levels and trends including exception levels along with identification and mitigation of emerging risks in order to facilitate the corporate credit risk management process various other corporate functions provide the resources for the strategic credit committee to carry out its responsibilities the corporation manages credit risk through underwriting and periodically reviewing and approving its credit exposures using approved credit policies and guidelines additionally the corporation manages credit risk through loan portfolio diversification limiting exposure to any single industry customer or guarantor and selling participations andor syndicating credit exposures above those levels it deems prudent to third parties the credit division manages credit policy and provides the resources to manage the line of business transactional credit risk assuring that all exposure is risk rated according to the requirements of the credit risk rating policy and providing business segment reporting support as necessary the enterprise risk division provides credible and welldocumented challenge of overall portfolio credit risk and other creditrelated

reserve component for energy loans there were million and million in net creditrelated chargeoffs in the energy business line for the years ended december and respectively criticized loans increased million to million at december the increase in net chargeoffs and criticized loans resulted from the impact of a decline in valuations of select liquidating assets due to tight capital markets in the industry leveraged loans certain loans in the corporations commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions these loans are typically used for mergers acquisitions business recapitalizations refinancing and equity buyouts to help mitigate the risk associated with these loans the corporation focuses on middle market companies with highly capable management teams strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance industries prone to cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants during the underwriting process cash flows are stress tested to evaluate the borrowers abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates the fdic defines higherrisk commercial and industrial hr ci loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt

international exposure international assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in countries including economic uncertainties and each foreign governments regulations risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements these practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities which secure repayment from sources external to the borrowers country accordingly such international outstandings are excluded from the crossborder risk of that country there were no countries with crossborder outstandings exceeding percent of total assets at december and the corporations international strategy is to focus on international companies doing business in north america with an emphasis on the corporations primary geographic markets market and liquidity risk market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices liquidity risk represents the risk that the corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times the asset and liability policy committee alco of the corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities alco meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation including treasury finance economics lending deposit gathering and risk management corporate treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established limits for the minimum number of months into the future in which the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos liquidity policy requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and debt obligations with a target of months but no less than months corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting of the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at december was percent 30day libor percent other libor primarily 60day percent prime and percent fixed rate this creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes as of the balance sheet dates f28 table of contents are included in the analysis but no additional hedging is forecasted at december these derivative instruments comprise interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt to variable rates through fair value hedges and convert billion of variablerate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges this base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline basis points in a linear nonparallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average increase or decrease in shortterm interest rates of basis points over the period each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior yield curve changes loan and deposit pricing and overall balance sheet mix and growth in this low rate environment depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends as a result the rising rate scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates rise changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis the table below as of december and displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above in millions december change in interest rates rising basis points declining basis points estimated annual change amount amount sensitivity to declining interest rates decreased from december to december due to the impact of swaps converting variablerate loans to fixed rates sensitivity to rising interest rates increased due to changes in balance sheet composition partially offset by the addition of swaps converting variablerate loans to fixed rates during january the corporation added interest rate swaps that convert an additional billion of variablerate loans to fixed rates through cash flow hedges these additional hedges are not included in the sensitivity analysis discussed above sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base case economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel basis point shock the table below as of december and displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above in millions december change in interest rates rising basis points declining basis points amount amount the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising and declining rates increased from december and december due to changes in expected deposit lives and balance sheet composition partially offset by the addition of swaps converting variablerate loans to fixed rate libor transition on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after the corporation has substantial exposure to liborbased products including loans securities derivatives and hedges and is preparing

risk operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and people or from external events excluding in most cases those driven by technology see technology risk below the corporations definition of operational risk includes fraud employment practice and workplace safety clients products and business practice business continuity or disaster recovery execution delivery and process management third party and model risks the definition does not include strategic or reputational risks although operational losses are experienced by all companies and are routinely incurred in business operations the corporation recognizes the need to identify and control operational losses and seeks to limit losses to a level deemed appropriate by management as outlined in the corporations risk appetite statement the appropriate risk level is determined through consideration of the nature of the corporations business and the environment in which it operates in combination with the impact from and the possible impact on other risks faced by the corporation operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operating risks at appropriate levels the operational risk management committee monitors risk management techniques and systems the corporation has developed a framework that includes a centralized operational risk management function in the enterprise risk division and businesssupport unit risk liaisons responsible for managing operational risk specific to the respective business lines technology risk technology risk represents the risk of loss or adverse outcomes arising from the people processes applications and infrastructure that support the technology environment the corporations definition of technology risk includes technology delivery risk technology investment risk cybersecurity risk information security risk and information management risk technology risk is inclusive of the risks associated with the execution of technology processes and activities by thirdparty contractors and suppliers to the corporation other risk types may materialize in the event of a technology risk event such as the risk of a financial reporting error or regulatory noncompliance and the impact of such risks are highly interdependent with operational risk the technology risk

consideration for risks accepted and any other event not identified in the defined risk categories of credit market and liquidity operational technology or compliance risks mitigation of the various risk elements that represent strategic risk is achieved through various metrics and initiatives to help the corporation better understand measure and report on such risks f33 table of contents critical accounting policies the corporations consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies the most significant of which are described in note these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations changes in underlying factors assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the corporations future financial condition and results of operations at december the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses fair value measurement goodwill pension plan accounting and income taxes these policies were reviewed with the audit committee of the corporations board of directors and are discussed more fully below allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses managements determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio lendingrelated commitments and other relevant factors this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires numerous estimates including the loss content for internal risk ratings collateral values the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows and for lendingrelated commitments estimates of the probability of draw on unused commitments in addition management exercises judgment to adjust or supplement modeled estimates for factors not otherwise fully accounted for such as the risks and uncertainties observed in current market conditions portfolio developments and other imprecision factors in determining the allowance for credit losses the corporation individually evaluates certain impaired loans applies standard reserve factors to pools of homogeneous loans and lendingrelated commitments and incorporates qualitative adjustments standard loss factors applied to the majority of the corporations loan portfolio and lendingrelated commitments are based on estimates of probabilities of default for individual risk ratings over the loss emergence period and loss given default loss emergence periods are used to determine the most appropriate default horizon associated with the calculation of probabilities of default changes to one or more of the estimates used to develop standard loss factors or the use of different estimates would result in a different estimated allowance for credit losses to illustrate if recent loss experience dictated that the estimated standard loss factors would be changed by five percent of the estimate across all loan risk ratings the allowance for loan losses as of december would change by approximately million because standard loss factors are applied to pools of loans based on the corporations internal risk rating system loss estimates are highly dependent on the accuracy of the risk rating assigned to each loan the inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning andor entering risk ratings in the loan accounting system is monitored by the corporations asset quality review function and incorporated in a qualitative adjustment the corporation may also include qualitative adjustments intended to capture the impact of certain other uncertainties that exist but are not yet reflected in the standard reserve factors these qualitative adjustments are based on managements analysis of factors such as portfolios where recent historical losses exceed expected losses or known recent events are expected to alter risk ratings once evidence is acquired observable macroeconomic metrics including consideration of regional metrics within the corporations footprint and a qualitative assessment of the lending environment including underwriting standards current economic and political conditions and other factors affecting credit quality qualitative reserves at december primarily included components for portfolios where recent loss trends were in excess of estimated losses based on overall portfolio standard loss factors model imprecision and changes in market conditions compared to the conditions that existed at the date of the most recent annual update to standard reserve factors for further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses refer to note to the consolidated financial statements to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates additional provision for credit losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods the allowance is assigned to business segments and any earnings impact resulting from actual outcomes differing from management estimates would primarily affect the business bank segment on january the corporation adopted a new accounting standard for estimating credit losses cecl for additional information about the adoption of cecl refer to the pending accounting pronouncements section of note to the consolidated financial statements fair value measurement investment securities availableforsale derivatives and deferred compensation plan assets and associated liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis additionally from time to time other assets and liabilities may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis such as impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral other real estate primarily foreclosed property nonmarketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve writedowns of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting f34 table of contents fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction ie not a forced transaction such as a liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date and is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability fair value measurement and disclosure guidance establishes a threelevel hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value notes and to the consolidated financial statements includes information about the fair value hierarchy the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities as well as the valuation methodologies and key inputs used at december assets and liabilities measured using observable inputs that are classified as level or level represented percent and percent of total assets and liabilities recorded at fair value respectively valuations generated from modelbased techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market are considered level and reflect estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability goodwill goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment the corporation may elect to perform a quantitative impairment analysis or first conduct a qualitative analysis to determine if a quantitative analysis is necessary goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level equivalent to a business segment or one level below the corporation has three reporting units the business bank the retail bank and wealth management at december goodwill totaled million including million allocated to the business bank million allocated to the retail bank and million allocated to wealth management the annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter the corporation first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount including goodwill qualitative factors included economic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance regulatory developments and performance of the corporations stock among other events and circumstances at the conclusion of the qualitative assessment in the third quarter the corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value qualitative factors considered in the analysis of each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions including the recent federal reserve announcements and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes to the extent known however further weakening in the economic environment such as continued declines in interest rates a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge additionally new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in managements expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge any impairment charge would not affect the corporations regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position pension plan accounting the corporation has a qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan effective january benefits are calculated using a cash balance formula based on years of service age compensation and an interest credit based on the 30year treasury rate participants under age as of december are eligible to receive a frozen final average pay benefit in addition to amounts earned under the cash balance formula participants age or older as of december continue to be eligible for a final average pay benefit the corporation makes assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of required benefit payments funding requirements and defined benefit pension expense the major assumptions are the discount rate used in determining the current benefit obligation the longterm rate of return expected on plan assets mix of assets within the portfolio and the projected mortality rate the discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the pension plans to a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date december the longterm rate of return expected on plan assets is set after considering both longterm returns in the general market and longterm returns experienced by the assets in the plan the current target asset allocation model for the plans is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements the expected returns on these various asset categories are blended to derive one longterm return assumption the assets are invested in certain collective investment funds common stocks us treasury and other us government agency securities as well as corporate and municipal bonds and notes mortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables published by thirdparties such as the society of actuaries soa considering other available information including historical data as well as studies and publications from reputable sources the corporation reviews its pension plan assumptions on an annual basis with its actuarial consultants to determine if the assumptions are reasonable and adjusts the assumptions to reflect changes in future expectations the major assumptions used to calculate defined benefit plan pension expense benefit were as follows f35 table of contents discount rate longterm rate of return on plan assets mortality table base table a mortality improvement scale a a issued by the society of actuaries in october pri2012 mp2019 defined benefit plan expense is expected to decrease million to a benefit of approximately million in compared to a benefit of million in this includes service cost expense of million and a benefit from other components of million changing the discount rate and longterm rate of return by basis points would impact defined benefit expense in by million and million respectively due to the longterm nature of pension plan assumptions actual results may differ significantly from the actuarialbased estimates differences resulting in actuarial gains or losses are required to be recorded in shareholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized to defined benefit pension expense in future years refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information income taxes the calculation of the corporations income tax provision and taxrelated accruals is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes due for the current year and deferred taxes deferred taxes arise from temporary differences between the income tax basis and financial accounting basis of assets and liabilities accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions currently or in the future and are included in accrued income and other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets the corporation assesses the relative risks and merits of tax positions for various transactions after considering statutes regulations judicial precedent and other available information and maintains tax accruals consistent with these assessments the corporation is subject to audit by taxing authorities that could question andor challenge the tax positions taken by the corporation included in net deferred taxes are deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on available evidence of projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences assumptions made regarding future events and when applicable state loss carryback capacity a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur due to changes in tax law interpretations of existing tax laws new judicial or regulatory guidance and the status of examinations conducted by taxing authorities that impact the relative risks and merits of tax positions taken by the corporation these changes when they occur impact the estimate of accrued taxes and could be significant to the operating results of the corporation for further information on tax accruals and related risks see note to the consolidated financial statements f36 table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures used
