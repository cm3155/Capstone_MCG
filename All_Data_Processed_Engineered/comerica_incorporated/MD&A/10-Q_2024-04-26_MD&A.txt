the period partially offset by higher consulting fees and a refund related to a favorable state tax ruling recorded in the period strategic lines of business the corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities note to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the threemonth periods ended march and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines note to the consolidated financial statements in the corporations annual report describes the corporations segment reporting methodology net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp funding credits and charges the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the longterm value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities due to the longerterm nature of implied maturities ftp crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets as a result of applying matched funding interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds as well as the volume of deposits at the associated ftp crediting rates generally in periods of rising interest rates ftp charge rates for funding loans and ftp crediting rates on deposits will increase with ftp crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than ftp charge rates for funding loans business segments the following sections present a summary of the performance of each of the corporations business segments for the three months ended march compared

december basel iii endgame framework on july the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking commonly referred to as basel iii endgame the capital proposal that would significantly increase the capital requirements applicable to large banking organizations with total assets of billion or more the capital proposal would align the regulatory capital calculation and the calculation of riskweighted assets across large banking organizations subject to the capital proposal and require category iii and iv banking organizations to include most components of aoci including net unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities in their regulatory capital ratios the capital proposal is subject to a public comment period which ended on january and if adopted would include a threeyear transition period beginning july as of march the corporation had total assets of billion while the capital proposal would not apply to the corporation as it is currently proposed if the corporation becomes subject to the requirements of the capital proposal in the future or becomes subject to any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity such requirements could limit the corporations ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital which would have a material adverse effect on the corporations financial condition and results of operations if subject to the capital proposal the estimated impact related to proposed inclusion of most components of aoci would be an approximate basis point decrease to common equity tier1 capital based on march financials risk management the following updated information should be read in conjunction with the risk management section on pages f18 through f34 in the corporations annual report credit risk allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses was million at both march and december the following table presents metrics of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans march december allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans the economic forecasts informing the current expected credit loss cecl model reflect headwinds from the federal reserve banks tight monetary policy less expansionary fiscal policy and moderation of consumer spending growth which collectively slow growth of the real economy inflation is expected to gradually moderate as a modest margin of slack capacity opens in the labor market energy prices are projected to level off despite continued crosswinds from the russiaukraine and mideast wars as us crude production holds near a record high residential real estate property prices are expected to rise at more moderate rates while commercial real estate prices face headwinds both reflecting the long and variable lags of the federal reserve banks tighter monetary policy downside risks to growth from geopolitical risks the restart of student loan payments costofliving pressures on household finances and less expansionary fiscal policy are projected to collectively contribute to slower growth in reduced demand for office space and subdued economic activity in the central business districts of major metro areas are persistent drags on the broader economy the federal reserve banks aggressive tightening of monetary policy including rapid increases in interest rates and reductions in the size of its balance sheet contribute to the risk of a policy error andor recession these factors shaped the 2year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the corporation in its cecl estimate at march the us economy is projected to grow at a belowtrend rate through before gradually normalizing to its trend growth rate the unemployment rate is expected to rise modestly as economic growth slows but stay relatively low compared to its longerrun history forecasts for other key economic variables are generally consistent with those of the gross domestic product gdp while interest rate forecasts reflect market expectations and guidance from the federal reserve bank available during the first quarter of the following table summarizes select variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the cecl estimate at march economic variable base forecast real gross domestic product gdp growth growth slows to under percent through the third quarter before recovering to approximately percent by the end of the forecast period unemployment rate expected to increase to percent by first quarter followed by a modest decline throughout to percent by the end of the forecast period spread of corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spread widens to percent by fourth quarter before normalizing to approximately percent by oil prices prices average between and per barrel throughout the forecast period due to the high level of uncertainty regarding assumptions used as inputs to the forecast the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including more benign and more severe economic forecasts in a more severe scenario real gdp is projected to contract throughout subsequently improving to a growth rate of percent by the end of the forecast period other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of shortterm deterioration followed by a recovery except for unemployment levels which remained elevated through the end of the forecast period selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses of approximately million as of march however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario the corporation monitors evolving economic conditions for impacts to the allowance for credit losses allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimates of current expected credit losses in the corporations loan portfolio the allowance for loan losses increased million to million at march compared to million at december collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors designed to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools the allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for including adjustments for foresight risk input imprecisions and model imprecision credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and are based on one of several methods including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors determined in a manner similar to business loans multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk applied to commitment amounts the allowance for

and march respectively market and liquidity risk market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movement in prices including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices liquidity risk represents the risk that the corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times the asset liability management committee alco of the corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities alco meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation including treasury finance economics lending deposit gathering and risk management corporate treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions the corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments such environments cover a series of scenarios including both idiosyncratic and marketwide in nature which vary in terms of duration and severity the corporations evaluation as of march projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations such as debt service dividend payments and normal operating expenses over a period of no less than months the corporation had liquid assets of billion on an unconsolidated basis at march corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting of the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at march was percent fixedrate percent overnight to 30day rate primarily bsby and sofr percent 90day and greater rates and percent prime the composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a basecase net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model assumptions each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns additionally the analysis assumes that all loan hedges qualify for hedge accounting changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis model assumptions in the sensitivity scenarios at march included for the rising rate scenarios a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances and for the declining rate scenarios a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances in addition both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels an incremental interestbearing deposit beta of approximately deposit mix shifts based on historical observations partial reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps the average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was billion for the three months ended march with an average yield of and effective duration of years the table below details components of the variablerate loan swap portfolio at march variablerate loan swaps a dollar amounts in millions notional amount weighted average yield years to maturity b swaps under contract at march c weighted average notional active per period full year full year a included billion in swaps which no longer qualified for cash flow hedging designation following bsby cessation as of april these swaps were redesignated b years to maturity calculated from a starting date of march c includes forward starting swaps of billion starting in excluding forward starting swaps the weighted average yield was the analysis also includes interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt and fhlb advances to variable rates through fair value hedges additionally included in this analysis are billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of basis points at march this basecase net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which shortterm rates rise or decline or basis points with a floor of zero percent in a linear nonparallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average change of or basis points over the period the table below as of march and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above estimated annual change march december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change

rising basis points rising basis points basis points on average basis points on average declining basis points declining basis points basis points on average basis points on average sensitivity to declining interest rates decreased from december to march resulting from a decline in nonmaturity deposits and fixedrate investment securities partially offset by a decrease in time deposits and wholesale funding sensitivity to rising interest rates was impacted by the same factors at march additional sensitivity scenarios applied the rising and declining basis point scenario assumptions with a incremental deposit beta relative to the base case scenario to assess the impact of the corporations deposit beta assumptions in these rising and declining scenarios net interest income decreased by million and increased by million respectively due to a more rapid repricing pace compared to the standard model assumptions all scenarios presented for march reflected a change in balance sheet composition following the march banking industry disruption as the balance sheet maintained a higher concentration of cash as well as increased wholesale funding and brokered deposits which contributed to the decrease in net interest income in all scenarios presented sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel or basis point shock with a floor of zero percent the table below as of march and december displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above march december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining basis points declining basis points rising basis points rising basis points declining basis points declining basis points the negative sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates increased from december to march due to updated deposit runoff assumptions partially offset by a declining notional amount of cash flow swaps and a smaller securities portfolio sensitivity to declining rates increased the economic value of equity due to the same factors bsby cessation on november the bloomberg index services limited bloomberg announced that it will discontinue publishing bsby on november accordingly the corporation was required to dedesignate billion of interest rate swaps used in cash flow hedges of certain bsbyindexed loans and reclassify amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings for each dedesignated swap settlement of interest payments and changes in fair value were recorded as risk management hedging losses within other noninterest income instead of net interest income until redesignation all impacted swaps were redesignated as of april the net impact of bsby cessation to interest income on commercial loans was a million benefit for both the three month periods ended march and december additionally the corporation recognized a net loss of million in noninterest income for the three months ended march compared to million for the three months ended december refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of dedesignated interest rate hedges at march the corporation had billion of exposure to bsbybased products including billion in loans and billion in interest rate swaps the corporation ceased originating bsbybased products and is working to convert bsbybased loans to other indices as repricing opportunities occur the corporation expects that many of the bsbybased contracts will organically transition to sofr over the upcoming year with any remaining contracts transitioning to sofr through existing fallback language which for loans is the first repricing date after bsby cessation occurs in november for interest rate swaps the corporation plans to enact the international swaps and derivatives association isda definition and benchmark supplement language as applicable sources of liquidity the corporation maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations while taking into account potential commitment draws and deposit runoff that may occur in the normal course of business the majority of the corporations balance sheet is funded by customer deposits cash flows from loan repayments increases in deposit accounts including brokered deposits activity in the securities portfolio and wholesale funding channels serve as the corporations primary liquidity sources the corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources available liquidity includes cash fhlb advances and
