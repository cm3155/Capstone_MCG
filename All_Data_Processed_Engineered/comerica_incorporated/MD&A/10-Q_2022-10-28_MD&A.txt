salaries and benefits strategic lines of business the corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management these business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided in addition to the three major business segments the finance division is also reported as a segment the other category includes items not directly associated with the business segments or the finance segment the performance of the business segments is not comparable with the corporations consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities note to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of the business segments for the three and ninemonth periods ended september and the corporations management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies which are regularly reviewed and refined these methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure andor product lines note to the consolidated financial statements in the corporations annual report describes the corporations segment reporting methodology net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interestbearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing ftp the ftp methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded ftp crediting rates on deposits and other funds provided reflect the longterm value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities due to the longerterm nature of implied maturities ftp crediting rates are generally less volatile than changes in interest rates observed in the market ftp charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets as a result of applying matched funding interest revenue for each segment resulting from loans and other assets is generally not impacted by changes in interest rates therefore net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume of loans and other earning assets at the spread over the matched cost of funds as well as the volume of deposits at the associated ftp crediting rates generally in periods of rising interest rates ftp charge rates for funding loans and ftp crediting rates on deposits will increase with ftp crediting rates for deposits typically repricing at a slower pace than ftp charge rates for funding loans business segments the following sections present a summary of the performance of each

assets and ratios are estimated b see supplemental financial data section for reconciliations of nongaap financial measures and regulatory ratios the common shareholders equity ratio decreased basis points to percent at september primarily due to the change in unrealized losses in the corporations investment securities portfolio and to a lesser extent its cash flow hedge portfolio the unrealized losses in the corporations availableforsale investment security portfolio are due to market valuations since the time of initial acquisition which in substantially all cases are not expected to be realized the tangible common equity ratio which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets decreased basis points to percent for the same reasons the impact of cumulative unrealized losses recorded

section on pages f17 through f33 in the corporations annual report credit risk allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses increased million from million at december to million at september as a percentage of total loans the allowance for credit losses was percent at september compared to percent at december the allowance for credit losses covered times and times total nonperforming loans at september and december respectively the following table presents metrics of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming loans september december allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonaccrual loans allowance for credit losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans the economic forecasts informing the current expected credit loss cecl model primarily reflected continued strong credit quality a tight labor market and strong demand for goods and services excess savings and pentup demand from consumers as well as robust labor markets have supported growth in the broader us economy however there are increasing downside risks from the impacts of inflationary pressures future monetary policy actions and the slowing housing market foreign developments also pose additional headwinds including the impacts of the russiaukraine conflict chinas lockdowns ongoing supply chain issues and economic challenges in europe these factors shaped the 2year reasonable and supportable forecasts used by the corporation in its cecl estimate at september the us economy is projected to continue to grow in fourth quarter with the pace of expansion slowing significantly in before returning to longerterm growth rates in certain economic variables like oil prices are expected to normalize over the forecast period while others like the unemployment rate are projected to remain stable interest rates are forecasted to increase through late and then gradually decline consistent with the federal reserves projections while corporate bond spreads are expected to reflect normalized default risk the following table summarizes select variables representative of the economic forecasts used to develop the allowance for credit losses estimate at september economic variable base forecast real gross domestic product gdp growth growth peaks at percent in fourth quarter before slowing to under percent through subsequently reaccelerating to an expected longerterm growth rate in unemployment rate expected to increase from current levels to percent by first quarter remaining stable for the remainder of the forecast period corporate bbb bond to 10year treasury bond spreads projected to reflect a normalized level of default risk throughout the forecast period oil prices prices steadily decline from current levels to below per barrel by the end of the forecast period due to the high level of uncertainty regarding significant assumptions the corporation evaluated a range of economic scenarios including more benign and more severe economic forecasts in a more severe scenario real gdp is expected to contract through fourth quarter subsequently improving to a growth rate of percent by the end of the forecast period other key economic variables follow a similar pattern of shortterm deterioration followed by a recovery selecting the more severe forecast would result in an increase in the quantitative calculation of allowance for credit losses of approximately million as of september however factoring in model overlays and qualitative adjustments could result in a materially different estimate under a more severe scenario the corporation monitors evolving economic conditions for impacts to the allowance for credit losses allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimates of current expected credit losses in the corporations loan portfolio pools of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated while loans that no longer share risk characteristics with loan pools are evaluated individually the allowance for loan losses decreased million to million at september compared to million at december collective loss estimates are determined by applying reserve factors designed to estimate current expected credit losses to amortized cost balances over the remaining contractual life of the collectively evaluated portfolio loans with similar risk characteristics are aggregated into homogeneous pools the allowance for loan losses also includes qualitative adjustments to bring the allowance to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that have not otherwise been fully accounted for including adjustments for foresight risk input imprecisions and model imprecision credit losses for loans that no longer share risk characteristics with the loan pools are estimated on an individual basis individual credit loss estimates are typically performed for nonaccrual loans and modified loans classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs and are based on one of several methods including the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral observable market value of similar debt or the present value of expected cash flows allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments estimates current expected credit losses on collective pools of letters of credit and unused commitments to extend credit based on reserve factors determined in a manner similar to business loans multiplied by a probability of draw estimate based on historical experience and credit risk applied to commitment amounts for additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses refer to the critical accounting estimates section and pages f51 through

interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and equity prices liquidity risk represents the risk that the corporation does not have sufficient access to funds to maintain its normal operations at all times or does not have the ability to raise or borrow funds at a reasonable cost at all times the asset and liability policy committee alco of the corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities alco meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the corporation including treasury finance economics lending deposit gathering and risk management corporate treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of alco through the actions it takes to manage the corporations market liquidity and capital positions the corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments such environments cover a series of scenarios including both idiosyncratic and marketwide in nature which vary in terms of duration and severity the evaluation as of september projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis corporate treasury also monitors the parent companys liquidity and has established liquidity coverage requirements for meeting expected obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries alcos policy on liquidity risk management requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected cash obligations over a period of no less than months the corporation had liquid assets of billion on an unconsolidated basis at september corporate treasury and the enterprise risk division support alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks key activities encompass i providing information and analyses of the corporations balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks ii monitoring and reporting of the corporations positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines iii developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions iv reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval and v monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks interest rate risk net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the corporation interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities primarily through the corporations core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits the corporations balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floatingrate loans funded by core deposits including the impact of interest rate swaps converting floatingrate loans to fixed the corporations loan composition at september was percent 30day or less rate primarily libor and bsby percent fixedrate percent prime and percent comprised of 90day and greater rates the composition of the loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio versus deposit products in addition the growth andor contraction in the corporations loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions examples of such actions are purchasing fixedrate investment securities which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest rate sensitivity as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options other mitigating factors include interest rate floors on a portion of the loan portfolio the corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity the corporation is currently targeting low single digit net interest income at risk to a basis point gradual decline in interest rates since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk these techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios including changes in the level slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including but not limited to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates market conditions regulatory impacts and management strategies sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates the analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is managements principal risk management technique management models a basecase net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment using a static balance sheet and generates sensitivity scenarios by changing certain model assumptions each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth investment security prepayment levels depositor behavior and overall balance sheet mix and growth which are in line with historical patterns changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis model assumptions in the sensitivity scenarios at september included for the rising rate scenario a modest increase in loan balances and a moderate decrease in deposit balances and for the declining rate scenario a modest decrease in loan balances and a moderate increase in deposit balances in addition both scenarios assumed loan spreads held at current levels an incremental interestbearing deposit beta of approximately no reinvestment of securities portfolio cash flows and no additions to interest rate swaps the average balance of the securities portfolio included in the analysis was billion for the three months ended september with an average yield of and effective duration of years the table below details components of the cash flow hedge portfolio at september cash flow hedges dollar amounts in millions notional amount weighted average yield years to maturity a swaps under contract at september b weighted average notional active per period first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year full year a years to maturity calculated from a starting date of september b includes forward starting swaps of billion starting in fourth quarter and billion starting in and beyond excluding forward starting swaps the weighted average yield was the analysis also includes interest rate swaps that convert billion of fixedrate medium and longterm debt to variable rates through fair value hedges additionally included in this analysis are billion of loans that were subject to an average interest rate floor of basis points at september this basecase net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which shortterm rates rise or decline basis points with a floor of zero percent in a linear parallel fashion from the base case over months resulting in an average change of basis points over the period the table below as of september and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above estimated annual change september december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points basis points on average basis points on average declining basis points declining to zero percent basis points on average sensitivity to declining interest rates increased from december to september primarily due to increases in the federal funds rate to basis points allowing for a full basis point repricing of the balance sheet this was partially offset by additional cash flow hedges and investment securities added during and nonmaturity deposit runoff sensitivity to rising interest rates decreased due to increased cash flow hedges and nonmaturity deposit runoff but was partially offset by the increased repricing potential of floatingrate loans as they moved above their contractual floor rates sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes in interest rates in addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position the economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the corporations financial assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements the corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the basecase economic value of equity the economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel basis point shock with a floor of zero percent the table below as of september and december displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above september december dollar amounts in millions amount amount change in interest rates change in interest rates rising basis points rising basis points declining basis points declining to zero percent the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to rising rates changed from an increase as of december to a reduction as of september due to additional receivefixed cash flow swaps growth of fixedrate securities and deposit runoff sensitivity to declining rates now increases economic value of equity due to the same factors libor transition on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after effective march the fca confirmed that certain libor tenors will no longer be supported after december and that the remaining tenors including those most commonly used by the corporation will cease to be supported after june the corporation has substantial exposure to liborbased products including loans and derivatives and is preparing for a transition from libor toward alternative rates the corporation ceased originating liborbased products in the fourth quarter of and has reduced libor exposure by approximately percent since december as of september the corporation estimates that approximately percent of its liborbased commercial loans have maturity dates prior to the cessation of libor of the remaining loans with maturity dates beyond the cessation date the corporation estimates that percent incorporate fallback language and is confident that it will achieve timely remediation of all other loans cessation planning for consumer loans is in process as the corporation has completed a review of the fallback terms for residential adjustablerate mortgages and identified alternate benchmarks for other smaller portfolio segments in addition to remediation activity on liborbased loans the corporation has enacted the international swaps and derivatives association isda protocols related to derivatives once events occur that trigger a fallback the reference rate for the variable leg of the swap will fall back from libor to the isda fallback rate which is the daily sofr plus a spread the corporations enterprise transition timelines are closely aligned with recommendations from the alternative reference rates committee for both best practices and recommended objectives the corporation will continue to align with industry and regulatory guidelines regarding the cessation of libor as well as monitor market developments for transitioning to alternative reference rates for a discussion of the various risks facing the corporation in relation to the transition away from libor see the market risk discussion within item risk factors beginning on page of the corporations annual report on form 10k for the year ended december sources of liquidity the corporation maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately satisfy its financial obligations while taking into account potential commitment draws and deposit runoff that may occur in the normal course of business the majority of the corporations balance sheet is funded by customer deposits cash flows from loan repayments increases in deposit accounts activity in the securities portfolio and the purchased funds market serve as the corporations primary liquidity sources the corporation satisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources the corporation had access to liquid assets of billion and billion at september and december respectively which included cash on deposit with the federal reserve and the portion of the investment securities portfolio that the corporation can sell without thirdparty consent in addition the corporation may access external funding sources when necessary which include fhlb advances federal funds reverse repurchase agreements brokered deposits and corporationissued bonds the corporation maintains a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission from which it may issue debt and equity securities purchased funds increased million to million at september compared to million at december reflecting an increase in shortterm fhlb advances at september the bank had pledged

policies the most significant of which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the corporations annual report these policies require numerous estimates and strategic

condition and results of operations at december the most critical of these estimates related to the allowance for credit losses fair value measurement goodwill pension plan accounting and income taxes these estimates were reviewed with the audit committee of the corporations board of directors and are discussed more fully on pages f34 through f37 in the corporations annual report as of the date of this report there have been no significant changes to the corporations critical accounting estimates except for the updates to the goodwill critical accounting policy outlined below the corporation performed the annual goodwill impairment test in third quarter resulting in the following updates to the critical accounting policy on page f36 of the corporations annual report goodwill goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level equivalent to a business segment or one level below the corporation has three reporting units the commercial bank the retail bank and wealth management at september and december goodwill totaled million including million allocated to the commercial bank million allocated to the retail bank and million allocated to wealth management the annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter the corporation first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount including goodwill qualitative factors included economic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance regulatory developments and performance of the corporations stock among other events and circumstances at the conclusion of the qualitative assessment in third quarter the corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value analyzing goodwill includes consideration of various factors that continue to rapidly evolve and for which significant uncertainty remains including the impacts of inflationary pressures monetary policy actions a slowing housing market and foreign developments further weakening in the economic environment such as a decline in the performance of the reporting units could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in managements expectations could have similar impacts any impairment charge would not affect the corporations regulatory capital ratios tangible equity ratio or liquidity position supplemental financial data the corporation believes nongaap measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management investors regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends tangible common equity is used by the corporation to measure the quality of
