joining our call today we reported earnings of million an increase of over the second quarter our customers continue to act prudently conserving cash and adjusting their operations driving a reduction in loans and taking deposits to a new record lower loan balances along with strong credit metrics and an improving yet uncertain economic path resulted in the allowance for credit losses remaining near and a provision of million as far as revenue the impact from lower interest rates waned card fees remained robust and other fee income categories began to recover expenses are wellcontrolled and included a million increase in charitable contributions roe returned to double digits at nearly and our book value per share grew to the seventh consecutive quarterly increase we remain focused on continuing to enhance shareholder value based on recent conversations ive had with employees and customers sentiment appears to be modestly better reflecting cautious optimism and a sense of hope for the future based on our countrys overall economic resiliency weve begun to see some signs of improving conditions however it is very difficult to predict the pace of the recovery this is reflected in our loan portfolio where overall we are starting to see some positive trends balances began to grow in midquarter and increased modestly monthovermonth in september also our pipeline has begun to rebuild although it remains well below precovid levels on a full quarter average basis loans decreased billion in the third quarter the largest contributor was a million drop in average national dealer loan in conjunction with significant decline in dealer inventory levels in the second quarter which have yet to recover this is due to supply backlog following the manufacturing shutdown combined with a rebound in sales activity we anticipate loans will rebound next year as auto inventory returns to normal levels deposits continue to show strong broadbased growth with average balances increasing billion including billion in noninterestbearing deposits government stimulus programs have provided tremendous liquidity in addition as weve seen in other times of economic uncertainty our relationshipbased customers are maintaining and building cash in the safety of their comerica accounts the resulting increase in liquidity drove our total average assets to a record billion as expected net interest income declined million as lower interest rates had a million impact in this ultralowrate environment we continue to carefully manage loan and deposit pricing to attract and maintain customer relationships comerica has a strong credit culture with conservative credit underwriting which has served us well in times of economic stress during the current period of unprecedented disruption our portfolio has performed well and we believe this will continue to be a differentiator for us in the industry criticized loans remained stable and nonperforming assets were well below historic norms also net chargeoffs decreased only basis points however given the difficulty in predicting the path of economic recovery our credit reserve remains at over billion comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 we are staying close to our customers in addressing their needs at the current level we believe our reserves are appropriate and that we are wellpositioned noninterest income increased as customer activity began to rebound including continued strong contribution from our card platform of note following robust activity in the second quarter derivative income declined billion we have continued to maintain our expense discipline excluding the impact of deferred comp and an increase in charitable contributions expenses declined our capital remains strong with an estimated cet1 of we remain focused on deploying our capital to support growth while maintaining our very attractive competitive dividend and now ill turn the call over to jim to review the quarter in more detail james j herzog executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide average loans decreased billion which compares favorably to results for the industry as indicated by the h8 data for large banks as curt mentioned national dealer declined million due to low inventory levels impacting floor plan loans as far as corporate banking you may recall that large companies drew on lines earlier this year to build liquidity buffers in a time of great uncertainty this resulted in an increase of nearly million in second quarter average balances corporate banking line utilization has returned to prepandemic levels with average balances down nearly million in the third quarter general middle market loans declined about million while deposits increased nearly billion customers have been prudently cutting costs as well as reducing working capital and capex requirements to improve their cash flow in this challenging environment for the portfolio as a whole line utilization decreased to at period end on the other hand with full quarter effect of ppp loans grew in business banking and the small business segment captured in retail banking also our mortgage banker business which serves mortgage companies was at an alltime high increasing over million due to very robust refi and home sale activity loan yields were a decrease of basis points from the second quarter lower rates were the major driver onemonth libor the rate were most sensitive to declined basis points this was partly offset by pricing actions we are taking particularly adding libor floors when possible as loans renew a mix shift in balances including the full quarter impact of lower yielding ppp loans also had a negative impact on yields deposits increased or billion to a new record of billion as shown on slide the larger driver continues to be noninterestbearing deposits and growth has been broadbased with increases in nearly every business line as curt mentioned customers are conserving and maintaining excess cash balances periodend deposits increased over million the largest contributor was technology and life sciences as robust fundraising added liquidity and customers reduced cash burn with strong deposit growth our loanto deposit ratio decreased to the average cost of interestbearing deposits was basis points a decrease of basis points from the second quarter our prudent management of relationship pricing in this low rate environment our large proportion of noninterestbearing deposits as well as the floating rate nature of our wholesale funding drove our total funding cost to only basis points for the quarter comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 as you can see on slide weve put some of our excess liquidity to work by increasing the size of the portfolio we added billion in treasuries and million in mortgagebacked securities in addition we continue to reinvest prepays which remained elevated at around billion for the quarter yields on recent purchases have been around basis points the additional securities combined with lower rates on the replacement of prepays resulted in the yield on the portfolio declining to of note weve not seen a significant impact on the portfolio striation or the unamortized premium which remains relatively small turning to slide net interest income declined million to million and the net interest margin was a decline of basis points relative to the second quarter the major factors were lower rates which had a negative impact of million or basis points on the margin and the increase in excess liquidity reduced the margin by basis points taking a look at the details interest income on loans declined million and reduced the margin basis points lower interest rates on loans alone had an impact of million and basis points on the margin lower balances had a million impact and the mix shift in portfolio including the full quarter of lower yielding ppp loans had a basis point impact on the margin partly offsetting this were higher loan fees in the margin primarily ppprelated as well as one additional day in the quarter as discussed in the previous slide we had lower yields and higher balances in our securities portfolio which together had a million and basis point negative impact higher deposits with the fed added million but had a negative impact of basis points on the margin deposit cost declined by million and added basis points to the margin primarily a result of our prudent management of deposit pricing as i previously mentioned finally with reduction in balances and lower rates wholesale funding costs declined by million adding basis points to the margin we received the full quarter benefit of debt repayments we made in the second quarter and we prepaid million in fhlb advances in july and august as a reminder given the nature of our portfolio our loans were priced very quickly so the bulk of the impact from lower rates has now been absorbed also we continue to closely monitor the competitive environment and our liquidity position as we manage deposit pricing overall credit quality was strong as shown on slide net chargeoffs were million or basis points including recoveries of million criticized loans remained relatively stable with an increase of only million and comprised of the total portfolio nonperforming loans remained low at basis points and the bulk of the million increase in the third quarter was attributed to energy loans in summary we are leveraging our experience and expertise working closely with our customers and carefully reviewing their current and projected financial performance we have adjusted risk ratings as appropriate we started this cycle from a position of strength with very low nonperforming and criticized loans and migration so far has been manageable turning to slide the economy began to improve through the quarter however the path to full recovery remains uncertain due to the unprecedented impacts of the covid19 pandemic for this reason our cecl modeling in the third quarter did not significantly change and included the recession that we have been experiencing followed by a slow recovery more severe assumptions were used to inform the qualitative adjustments made for certain segments this combined with a reduction in loan balances resulted in a slight decrease in our allowance for credit losses which remains above billion our credit reserve ratio was excluding ppp loans our credit reserve comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 coverage for npls was strong at times again we are wellpositioned with a relatively high credit reserve and low nonperforming assets as illustrated we believe our disciplined underwriting in diverse portfolio are assisting us in managing through this pandemic recession energy loans are outlined on slide they decreased million to billion at quarter end and represent of our total loans ep loans make up nearly of the energy portfolio and energy services which is considered the riskiest segment was only million the allocation of reserves to energy loans remained above while nonaccrual loans increased criticized loans decreased million and net chargeoffs decreased to million chargeoffs were net of million in recoveries which are unlikely to repeat in the near term fall determinations are just beginning and we expect a small increase in the borrowing basis as higher energy prices were offset by lower production inventory with more than years of serving this industry we have deep expertise and remain focused on working with our energy customers as they navigate the cycle slide provides detail on segments that we believe pose higher risk in the current environment note we continue to review the portfolio of refining our assessment as a result we have removed casinos and sports franchises from this group as we no longer see elevated risk that aside periodend loans in the social distancing segment decreased million or as expected criticized loans increased a million yet remain manageable at of the segment and nonaccruals remain very low we believe were wellreserved as we have applied a more severe economic forecast to the segment we have deep expertise and a long history of working in the cyclical automotive sector production has been ramping back up and auto sales have rebounded similar to the social distancing segment while loans decreased about million the criticized portion increased yet nonaccruals decreased and remain low our leveraged loans tend to be with middle market relationshipbased customers with sponsors management teams and industries we know well and we avoid the covenantlight deals balances increased to million and criticized and nonaccrual loans were slightly higher as far as payment deferrals they provided a cushion as customers adjusted to the environment now that theyve acclimated initial deferrals have expired and new requests have been nominal total deferrals at september dropped to only basis points of total loans noninterest income increased million as outlined on slide improved economic conditions had a positive impact on deposit service charges and card fees deposit service charges were up million with increased cash management activity also card fees remained very strong and increased million due to higher consumer volumes and merchant activity spurred by the economic stimulus as well as changes in customer behavior related to covid commercial lending fees grew with increased syndication activity in unutilized line fees as expected customer derivative income declined following very robust activity in the second quarter which related to the rapid decline in interest rates and volatile energy prices that have since stabilized derivative income also included a million unfavorable credit valuation adjustment compared to an unfavorable adjustment of million in the second quarter securities trading income decreased million but remained at an elevated level and reflects fair market adjustments for investments we hold related to our technology and life sciences business similarly investment banking fees declined yet continue to be relatively strong deferred comp asset returns were million a million increase from last quarter which is offset in noninterest expenses also bankowned life insurance increased with the receipt of the annual dividend comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 turning to expenses on slide salaries and benefits increased million this included the increase in deferred comp of million that i just mentioned as well as seasonally higher staff insurance a catchup on maintenance projects which we expect to continue in the fourth quarter as well as seasonal taxes resulted in an increase in occupancy costs as previously announced we increased our charitable contributions to assist businesses and communities impacted by the pandemic since earlymarch comerica together with comerica charitable foundation has distributed over million to over nonprofit and other community service organizations outside processing decreased million primarily related to lower ppp loan initiation volumes in addition operational losses and legalrelated costs declined million our expense discipline is wellingrained in our company and is assisting us in navigating this low rate environment as we invest for the future our capital levels remained strong increasing to an estimated cet1 of as shown on slide we remain focused on maintaining our attractive dividend and deploying our capital to drive growth while we maintain strong capital levels with a cet1 target of in addition the dividend is supported by a strong holding company cash slide provides our outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter we are assuming a continued gradual improvement in gdp and unemployment also while we do expect to see some modest forgiveness of ppp loans by the end of the year there is a great deal of uncertainty therefore we exclude any impact from forgiveness on loans net interest income and expenses from this outlook starting with loans we expect national dealer balances to increase as auto inventory levels begin to rebuild mortgage banker is expected to decline somewhat from its record high with seasonally lower purchase and refi volumes in addition we believe the recent stabilization of balances that weve seen in certain business lines such as middle market large corporate and energy should continue however on a quarteroverquarter basis average balances in these businesses are expected to be lower we expect average deposits to remain strong and stable as customers continue to carefully manage their liquidity this expectation excludes the benefit from any further government stimulus programs overall net interest income is expected to be relatively stable as we have already absorbed the bulk of the effect from the decline in rates we estimate the net effect of lower rates alone will be million or less the impact from reduced loan balances lower interest rates on loans and lower yields on securities is expected to be mostly offset by additional rate floors on loans a decrease in deposit rates to an average of basis points as well as the full quarter benefit of third quarter actions to increase our securities portfolio and reduce wholesale borrowings again this outlook excludes any benefit from ppp loan forgiveness credit quality is expected to be solid with net chargeoffs increasing from the low third quarter level which did include strong recoveries although the pace of the economic recovery remains uncertain with our credit reserve at about of loans in the third quarter we believe we are wellpositioned to manage through it we expect noninterest income to decline as we do not expect the third quarter levels of deferred comp securities trading income or boli to repeat we believe several customerdriven fee categories should grow with improving economic conditions but this is expected to be offset by card volume decreasing as recent elevated activity recedes comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 as far as expenses we expect a rise in technology costs as we catch up on initiatives that were delayed due to covid we are committed to investing in our futures that we are wellpositioned coming out of the pandemic in addition we expect an increase related to seasonal staff insurance mostly offsetting these increases charitable giving should revert to a normal level and we do not expect the level of deferred comp to repeat we continue to focus on controlling expenses as we closely manage discretionary spending finally our capital levels are healthy and we remain focused on managing our capital with the goal of providing an attractive return to our shareholders now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc i will close with slide over our 170year history comerica has successfully

providing an attractive return to our shareholders now wed be happy to take questions comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc hi good morning good morning you guys called out net interest income to roughly stabilize in the fourth quarter do you think were at the bottom for net interest income especially with rates really cant go much lower and youve got such a high percentage of the loans tied to onemonth libor james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah good morning peter yeah we are pretty much at the low given the balance sheet mix that we have right now so the million or less that i mentioned for the fourth quarter should continue kind of in the short to medium term i do expect to see a little bit of balance sheet shift movement or mix movement as we move into the second half of and beyond as some of our fixed rate assets start to turn over that would be some of the treasury securities as well as the hedges that we have in the appendix of the presentation here but i would view the million or less as kind of our base level of great impact for the foreseeable future pending any maturity of some of the fixed rate assets as they turn over in the future peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it and then just on the loan growth its challenging for you guys challenging for the industry curt in your prepared remarks you said youre starting to see some positive trends im just wondering if you can talk about some of the trends youre seeing and a little bit of color on the auto floor plan into next year and maybe middle market and small business peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah peter this is a peter sefzik so the positive trend that we would see you start to look at things like the pipeline starts to include more newtonew opportunities than just newtoexisting the activity level of our relationship managers has just picked up a little bit across all of our different geographies you certainly feel more activity than you did days ago but it is not at all near precovid levels so i would just say that our overall observations of what were seeing with customers and prospects is improving but i cant say its robust you asked about dealer and floor plan this has been a challenging year for that business but there are some good indicators the saar rate is sort of double what it was back in april right now on an annualized basis so were encouraged by that what jim and curt described what we typically see in the fourth quarter is a little bit of lift from a year ago we saw a drop in the fourth quarter but i think this year well kind of see our typical pattern that we have seen in dealer so were encouraged by that and we think thatll continue into comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 middle market and small business again a little bit of two different stories i think the middle market space is maybe a little more active than what you would see in small business that has been more hit through this covid crisis but both of those segments are conserving cash and managing their loans and being really really responsible and i think thats translated to the nice credit performance that we have seen so far and again depending on the geography and whats going on with covid sort of defines how active each of those segments is at the moment but we are encouraged by what were seeing in both of them probably more in middle market than maybe in business banking and small business just yet but that would be how id answer that peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thats great thanks for the color peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you peter operator your next question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks good morning just actually want to kind of followon peters question a little bit you mentioned that the nii is going to lets say be relatively stable for the foreseeable future but i think a lot of the market concern or question is what happens a little bit longer and you mentioned the treasury securities and the hedges are going to drive sort of balance sheet mix i suppose in the back half of how much does those hedges and other items actually add to nii today that will be going away in the future like where does nii bottom out if rates actually stay where they are when we think about like late or maybe james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc okay good morning ken to box it in for you we talk about the million of rate impact kind of in the short to medium term as you did some of that treasury churn and you did some of the hedges rolling off i would expect the rate impact to start edging up a little bit but i dont see it going past the million that we saw in the third quarter so you can kind of box it in using that range comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 ultimately if you go to the total hedge portfolio that we have you can do the math yourself you see it adds up to about million annually but those go out a number of years and obviously theres a number of things that could happen in the economy and a lot of uncertainty in terms of where rates might go over the next few years but the way i would frame it up for you is million in the short to medium term and then this thing starts to churn through well hover somewhere between million and million for a couple years after that but i dont see us really getting to the million number that we saw in the third quarter ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and sorry just to be clear when you say million or million are you talking like a million reduction per quarter is that what you mean james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thats right thats right million or less ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got okay so over the next say one year if its million per quarter then its million for the year something on a run rate basis james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thats right million or less taking that math ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay i understand and then sorry my followup question on slide youve talked about your energy portfolio which you guys always do and we appreciate but do you actually believe that theres outsized risk in energy lending today versus some of the other atrisk categories that you highlight melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah ken this is melinda i mean clearly the energy portfolio is where we have seen the most stress really over the last months i would say that kind of given the current environment and where oil and gas are today that has certainly helped stabilize our credit deterioration but in order for this segment to really start to improve prices are going to need to strengthen i expect that well continue to see some lumpiness and additional chargeoffs in the energy line of business if you look at where our nonaccruals are they are still concentrated in our energy book and the nonaccrual levels for the other atrisk portfolios are very very minimal at this point thats not to say that we wont see some additional migration in some of those other atrisk categories but for now i think our biggest risk probably continues to be in the energy line of business comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you ken operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning good morning everybody so just to start on the provision which was very modest this quarter if loan balances remain under pressure which youre guiding to in the fourth quarter and the economic model doesnt change much right if oil prices remain steady should we expect another quarter of very modest provision in the fourth quarter like similar to this quarter melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah as it relates to the cecl reserve i mean obviously you all know thats a highly complex process that we go through each quarter and look at a lot of the variables that you already mentioned kind of the economic forecast the level of the portfolio and how our portfolio is responding as the economy begins to recover even though well see losses occurring reserve levels theoretically should start to come down thats how cecl is designed to work predicting exactly when that would occur whether we would need to add to reserves or release is going to really materialize over the next couple of quarters we would expect that well continue to see some additional migration over the next two to three quarters including into nonaccruals and some resulting chargeoffs from that and assuming no other negative changes to the macroeconomic outlook reserve levels again should begin to normalize steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and how did the change in economic forecast impact this quarters reserve melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc it was more it was probably an equal weighting between the economic forecast being stable again  versus  we used consensus as well as remember our portfolio declined about billion so that obviously had an impact and then we added qualitative reserves to those atrisk portfolios to make sure that we had adequate comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 coverage for those atrisk portfolios which again we do expect to continue to see some migration and some losses but we believe that its going to be very manageable and wellcovered with our billion of reserves steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then finally for curt so i think the guidance for it looks like pretax pre provision income growth will remain a bit of a headwind from a big picture view assuming shortterm rates remain anchored near zero could you talk about your ability or maybe even a game plan to drive pretax pre provision income growth over the next year any new fee income initiatives expense initiatives anything you can talk about there thanks curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah steve obviously we are very focused on the return to our shareholders and delivering appropriate growth on roe and obviously despite some of the current challenges we do feel good about our longterm financial outlook and we continue to think we have a very attractive franchise that we operate in some great higher growth markets which we believe as we start to come out of the covid situation now the recovery that those markets should perform better than many areas of the country in addition i think that weve got a number of comparative strengths that we will continue to leverage credit is certainly one of those areas and i think will be in focus for the remainder of and maybe beyond that and we believe that based on our historical performance there we can perform very well there relative to our peer group you mentioned fee income its an area were very focused on and most notably i might mention treasury management continues to be an area of distinction for us and it continues to be an area that were investing in and adding additional capabilities i think you know weve got a very strong card and merchant platform we continue to feel like weve got upside opportunity there and then weve got really broad wealth management expertise and talent and were very focused on the intersection between our wealth management business the commercial bank and our retail bank in terms of driving new revenue then just on the balance sheet side peter talked a little bit about what were seeing there but we continue to have a lot of depth in middle market and business banking as well as a number of unique niche businesses that we think position us well versus the competitors especially as we come out of this situation and the only sort of niche business we have that maybe has some downward pressure on it would be energy and then were going to stay focused on expenses from a longterm perspective and well continue to look at opportunities that we might have to be careful on the expense side obviously did a really good job coming out of our gear up initiative and have run a very efficient organization relative to our peer group and having said all that what were not going to do is sort of sacrifice the longterm view and my perspective and i said this on our last earnings call is that when you look at our company now years old weve managed through lots of different cycles lots of different economic challenges and so we remain focused on the long term and the quality of our assets our overall longterm earnings power and investing in the franchise longer term and were going to focus on the things that we can manage in what is a very challenging environment i do think theres obviously a lot of uncertainty both with covid and more recently the election coming up so theres a lot thats unpredictable but we think were wellpositioned to sort of manage whatever direction the comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 economy may go in and again focusing on the long term and doing that at the same time and fixing how we can improve revenue in steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for all that color curt and thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc hello john rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc hey this is rahul patil on behalf of john so i just had one question on nim could you talk about some of the opportunities you have on the funding cost to mitigate some of the nim pressure amid this lowrate environment james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah good morning thats something we are looking at and considering taking action on were not ready to declare that quite yet we obviously let some more expensive funding mature in june and did some prepays both in the second quarter and the third quarter what we have left now really consists of a lot of parent company funding which of course were not going to prepay because we value the cash that we have at the parent company we have some sub debt which provides capital value so were not going to prepay that were really down to a very limited amount of bank senior debt which provides some pretty good fdic benefit and frankly the economics arent great if you went through a tender process so that pretty much leaves some fhlb funding of which weve really left the most efficient form of were paying in the very low 20bp range itd be difficult to obtain that level of funding again in terms of its efficiency so were considering doing something but were not quite ready to do that yet and so id say theres some limited opportunity that we may or may not be pulling the trigger on rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc okay and then just shifting to a different topic in your outlook i think you mentioned expenses tied to technology catchup could you just give us a sense for where you stand in terms of the tech spend which you consider as absolutely necessary versus something that can wait and then maybe what sort of incremental spend are you planning for over the next year or so in terms of tech curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah this is curt ill take that question what i would say on the frontend is that we did a lot of work through gear up to position our spend and really try to migrate the spend less around legacy platform and more around things that we would consider customer and colleagueenabling so we went through a lot of process around comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 rationalizing a lot of our aging platforms and applications weve done a lot to migrate applications to the cloud and just overall free up capacity so weve got a lot of things in flight right now we continue to work on loan origination capabilities especially online lending capabilities weve rolled out a companywide crm platform and have continued to make enhancements there were continuing to invest in our data analytics capabilities and how we use predictive analytics in the sales process and serving our customers weve got a new digital online platform for originating new customer relationships especially in the retail bank which is proving valuable to us in acquiring new relationships and weve talked about treasury management earlier and the list kind of goes on and what i would say is that when you look at sort of our spend today we definitely have freed up a lot of capacity for colleague and customerenabling type capabilities and we believe that we are staying very abreast of sort of where the industry is headed and increasingly are seeing more digital adoption of technologies across all of our platforms not just the retail bank but wealth management and commercial banking as well rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc good morning a couple followup questions on the nii line of questioning first you continue to carry a significant level of cash relative to history and im wondering as we think about your guidance that you talked about million base impact on quarterly net interest income that perhaps widens to a higher number thats less than million due to the impact of fixed rate repricing and the hedges rolling off what does that contemplate in terms of cash redeployment james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc good morning erika as we mentioned we did deploy the billion throughout the third quarter into some treasuries and mbs securities at this point in time we are not contemplating in that outlook that we gave additional actions in terms of either purchased funds prepayment or securities investment growth of the securities portfolio now both of those are possibilities but as i mentioned the funding we have is pretty efficient and of course as you know the yields out there arent especially enticing for redeploying cash in the securities we were willing to do a certain amount of that in the third quarter given some of the uncertainties that were there as well as our own asset sensitivity position and we could consider doing it in the future too but given some of the marginal benefit thats available at this point were not contemplating that and that is not baked into that outlook comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and consensus im looking at just because im thinking that could be a clean number for consensus excluding ppp paydowns and right now the consensus has net interest income of million for the fourth quarter of and a net interest margin of if were interpreting your comments right unless we get much better loan growth and a much better opportunity for cash redeployment that seems like that has to be readjusted lower for now james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc well well see were not ready to comment on yet keep in mind i did say million or less so i mean it could be a little more than zero could be a little less than million but its going to be in the low singledigit of millions and then loan volume will be a key obviously thats a big driver and thats a bit of a wildcard and then finally floors which are a part of that rate outlook we havent have some success with as you can see in one of the slides and that could be a driver also to help mitigate some of those pressures so not quite ready to comment on yet but we do see some opportunity to mitigate some of these headwinds erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one last one and maybe this is for curt theres been a lot of discussion on what normalized returns could be for banks and as i think about the recovery loan growth rates at comerica following the financial crisis robust through and much lower growth into through and then up in as we think about what comerica can earn sort of in a postcovid world do you see that the growth opportunity for this bank is really more of a gdp plus that seems like a softball question but the historical averages would suggest that it might be lower than that curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah erika what i think maybe to keep in perspective is historically we have grown more inline with gdp and i do think growth inline on a relative basis with gdp makes sense but also recognize that every market we operate in has a little bit different dynamics and maybe being impacted differently by either a recession or a recovery and then weve got some national businesses that can swing those numbers from timetotime based on dynamics that are in play whether its mortgage banker commercial real estate dealer energy etcetera what i do think is important to remember during that period of time between and is that we essentially managed down close to billion of energy outstandings and that was very deliberate on our part that was a very deliberate strategy to bring our exposure down from a number that was in the high single digits down to where it is today and we are comfortable with the portfolio based on the size it is today but we were derisking our portfolio and trying to derisk some of the volatility in the portfolio and so we were managing that down significantly and so while we were seeing growth in the rest of the core portfolio it was really being masked by that impact there but we do believe weve got a lot of growth opportunity we have been actively redeploying some of our fte to some of our higher growth businesses and some of our higher growth geographies and we also are seeing some disruption right now with some of our other competitors and so weve added some outside talent to the organization as well along the way comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 and we are keenly focused on new customer acquisition right now not only serving our existing customers but acquiring new customers in many of our business lines and many of our geographies so i think your statement is an accurate one and i do believe that the to was a little bit of a aberration based on some unique circumstances that we were managing through erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc thank you very helpful operator your next question will come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys hey thanks for taking the question i just wanted to return to the loan growth discussion for a quick second i think early in your prepared remarks you guys had said that loans grew modestly quarterover quarter for the first time in september what specifically was that was that like is national dealer finally sort of catching up or where did that net growth come from peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah scott this is peter so i think its a little bit of moving parts in there and if you look at that slide the conversation that weve talked a little bit about with what weve seen in dealer and what we think this transition into  is as you described a little bit of stabilization in dealer we do continue to see paydowns in the large corporate space weve seen some nice activity in our equity fund services business and we think weve kind of maybe seen utilization i think is about as low of utilization as weve really ever seen in a really really long time and so our belief is that thats kind of bottomed out if you will i dont know that i would say its on any sort of upward trajectory mortgage clearly had a really good september a good third quarter overall and our period end balances in mortgage for september were high so i dont know that i would take away from that that we are on some sort of uptick going into  the outlook weve described is what we think well see but we do feel like the end of the quarter was a little better than what we were seeing in the beginning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thats good color peter and i appreciate that and then i think you began to touch on what my thought was going to be which was on that line utilization number on slide the so it sounds like if im interpreting it correctly you guys think that is kind of bottom so is that sort of an accurate interpretation and is that indeed still above precovid levels because one or two other banks have actually seen utilization dip below precovid levels just wanted to get a sense for your thoughts there comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah yeah this is jim precovid of course we were a little bit higher than so clearly the reflects some of the lack of loan demand in this kind of covid environment peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah scott and i again that depending on what line of business and what geography youre talking it actually is less in some and higher in others so my hope would be that were kind of reaching the bottom or have reached the bottom but to jims point precovid levels for us i think would be higher in utilization than what youve got here r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you guys very much for the color peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc yeah operator your next question comes from the line ken usdin with jefferies curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning everyone a question on capital return so i guess the good news with the low provision is that the earnings coverage of the dividend is looking better as we look out you guys arent stress tested but just wondering how you think about the potential of getting back into buyback activity and how much you have to evaluate where the dividend is in terms of its size and payout at the point you get ready to or potentially get back into buybacks thanks james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc okay well good morning ken yeah as youve heard in past calls we continue to be confident about the dividend and i dont anticipate a change there at this point in time regarding buyback i like to say that were cautiously confident in terms of what we can see in front of us were not quite ready to turn the buyback on just yet because theres always the thought of what cant we see in front of us theres still a lot of uncertainties in this environment and we would like for there to be just a little more certainty in terms of the risks out there before we turn that buyback back on comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 but i also mentioned that some of the uncertainty isnt all negative some of it is potentially positive in the form of riskweighted asset growth or loan growth weve had a decrease in loans as you know exppp for a few quarters here and to the extent the economy bounces back and we get some loan growth that could eat into some of that capital too and we prize that capital and value it for providing capital to fund customer loan growth also so we just want to get a little bit more certainty in the environment before we declare the buyback turned back on curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc and jim just to add i mean our first objective is always to take care of our customers and so we would first and foremost like to deploy capital into assets in terms of the lending side but to the degree that doesnt happen we will continue to evaluate buyback ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood and a followup on the ppp side understanding that your guidance doesnt bake in any forgiveness can you tell us just generally how you are expecting and thinking about forgiveness to play through in terms of timeframe and whether or not youve made any changes to the fee schedule given the change between two year and fiveyear average durations thank you very much james j herzog a executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah theres a lot of uncertainty obviously with the forgiveness process so were not ready to make any predictions there yet which is why we excluded it from the outlook we have not made any changes in terms of we handle the fee amortization so were still on a twoyear basis and comfortable with where were at from an accounting standpoint on there and well just continue to monitor the environment and see where it goes were prepared to go though if and when congress and the treasury are ready to go ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc have customers do you have an idea of how many customers have already applied for forgiveness just to give us a sense of like whether or not to expect it to be active or not thanks guys appreciate it melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah this is melinda let me just talk for a minute about our forgiveness process we are actually starting our open invitation to clients starting today and well do that on a tiered basis we did pilot our technology platform for the forgiveness so weve accepted about applications as you know the sba was pretty slow to get their portal open and actually processing forgiveness applications so invitations will start going out today and that will be tiered based on loan size and we would expect to see those applications start coming in over the next to days its difficult to predict what the volume would be but were going to concentrate on the larger customers first because we are still hopeful quite frankly that we get additional relief for the smallest borrowers in terms of simplifying the application we did get simplification on it was helpful but not as helpful as we had hoped and were still hopeful that we will get forgiveness simplification for the loans less than and so those will tend to be more at the back half of the processing over the next quarter or so comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks very much operator your next question will come from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi thanks for taking my questions within national dealer services do you expect a more pronounced stepup here in the fourth quarter relative to what you saw in say and where just eyeballing slide it looks like there was typically a million increase in average balances peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc terry its peter yeah so i think what i would say is that when you look at that slide i would compare and where you saw an uptick to what we think were going to see this quarter versus a year ago where we saw the dropoff in that historically you would have seen that business uptick in the fourth quarter i dont know that it will be million like you described in we do think itll be up but we dont we think a year ago is not what were going to see where we saw a dropoff of million terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then just as a followup question maybe the mortgage banker finance book with period end loans billion and given the average in the third quarter is your view today that on an average basis mortgage banker finance is still higher in the fourth quarter and that really in the first quarter of next year is when you see the headwinds peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive directorcommercial bank comerica inc terry the answer to that is no we dont think so we think its actually going to dropoff here if you kind of look at page the mba originations forecast is down we think it will be sort of down to flat flat to down as we go into the fourth quarter and really continue into a lot along the lines of the forecast you see on the bottom right of page terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you operator ill now turn the conference back over to curt farmer chairman and ceo for any closing remarks comerica inc cma corrected transcript
