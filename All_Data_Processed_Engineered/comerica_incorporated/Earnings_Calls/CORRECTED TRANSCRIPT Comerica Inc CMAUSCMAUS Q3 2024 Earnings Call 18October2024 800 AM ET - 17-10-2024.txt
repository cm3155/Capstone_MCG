thank you kelly and good morning everyone today we reported third quarter earnings of million or per share exceeding expectations across most line items strong customer activity drove higher average deposits which offset the impact of lower loans and helped net interest income outperform guidance for the quarter the downward shift in the rate curve resulted in a meaningful improvement in aoci contributing to growth in tangible book value credit quality remained solid reflecting our prudent underwriting discipline as net chargeoffs remained historically low while customer sentiment remains cautiously optimistic the initial decline in rates was well received as select businesses showed early signs of an uptick in activity nearing quarter end however to see a more significant shift in behavior and reinvestment we believe customers are looking for further rate reductions confirmation of a soft landing and getting past the impending election before we get into more detail on our strong quarter i wanted to take a moment to touch on the historical milestone we celebrated on august comericas 175th anniversary my leadership team and i have spent a lot comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 of time this past quarter visiting our markets meeting with customers colleagues and community leaders we have a great story and a value proposition that resonates with our target market our customers trust us with their business and we take that responsibility seriously as a bank we have successfully navigated industry changes global conflicts and economic cycles over many years we feel this impressive history underscores the strength of our unique model and we believe our consistent execution along with our strategic investments position us to successfully support our customers now and into the future moving back to results third quarter financial highlights are on slide high inflation and elevated rates continued to pressure loan demand but we saw positive momentum in deposits as average balances grew in most of our businesses excluding the impact of bsby cessation net interest income increased over the second quarter trough chargeoffs of basis points remained below historical averages and even declined slightly from last quarters already strong results lower noncustomer income offset favorable trends in customerrelated fees and noninterest expenses were wellmanaged we continue to favor conservative approach to capital with our estimated cet1 increasing further to well above our strategic target jim will discuss our capital management strategy later in his presentation in all it was a great quarter with positive momentum moving into the end of the year i will now turn the call over to jim to review our third quarter financial results in more detail james j herzog chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to loans on slide we saw some reversal over the growth signals from the second quarter with loans coming down in august but were encouraged to see balances relatively flat in september most of the decline in average loans was in national dealer services and corporate banking dealers saw elevated balances in the second quarter related to the cyberattack that impacted the industry as we look at dealer trends month to month balances were most pressured early in the quarter and september saw more positive activity corporate banking specifically us banking saw more relative pressure than other businesses as we focus on maintaining our pricing discipline and return targets additionally soft loan demand across the industry caused some bank group consolidation us banking saw an improvement late in the quarter and periodend loans were relatively flat to june moving to businesses that grew commercial real estate utilization increased which was a continuation of the trend we have seen in this elevated rate environment however as rates come down we expect to see an uptick in the pace of payoffs as projects sell or refinance into the permanent market as intended growth in environmental services was attributed to our renewables focus in we formed a new renewables team and we have seen strong results environmental services overall is a great business for us and we feel our distinguished talent and unique expertise have allowed us to carve out a leading position in this niche industry touching briefly on loan yields lower nonaccrual interest was the main driver of the bps decline and we saw only a minor drag from lower shortterm rates in the quarter comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 on slide we were encouraged by customer deposit activity average deposits increased with growth across most business lines average third quarter brokered time deposits were higher due to activity late in the second quarter however favorable customer deposit trends allowed us to repay almost million in brokered cds by the end of the third quarter despite that deliberate reduction in brokered cds we grew total periodend deposits by over million as we win new and expand existing relationships we continue to see the elevated rate environment drive customers to bring those deposits into interest bearing accounts despite continued modest cyclical pressure on noninterestbearing balances they performed in line with our expectations and remain favorable at of total deposits we took steps to adjust pricing as the fed began to cut rates we plan to continue monitoring the competitive environment as we manage ongoing deposit pricing alongside additional rate cuts in the future with our strong relationship model we feel wellpositioned to strike the right balance between our customers objectives with their own funding needs and profitability our securities portfolio on slide benefited from the shift in the rate curve as we saw a improvement in our valuation adjustment in the quarter this favorable marktomarket impact more than offset repayments and maturities and drove a net million increase in the portfolio we continue to believe the expected repayment and maturities of this portfolio will enhance earnings in the coming quarters even if we resume investment at some point in turning to slide net interest income increased million to million excluding the impact of the bsby cessation net interest income would have grown million quarteroverquarter the shift in the rate curve allowed us to reallocate cash collateral from the cme to the fed benefiting net interest income that coupled with strong customer deposits which allowed us to pay down wholesale funding and the benefit of maturing swaps and securities offset pressures from bsby cessation lower loans and noninterestbearing deposit balances as shown on slide successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the composition of our balance sheet has made us slightly liabilitysensitive and allows us to better protect our profitability from a declining rate environment by strategically managing our swap and securities portfolio while considering balance sheet dynamics we intend to maintain our insulated position over time we feel credit quality remains a competitive strength as our overall trends in the third quarter remain solid and relatively unchanged from the second quarter as shown on slide net chargeoffs remain low at bps criticized loans were essentially flat and nonperforming assets remained well below historical averages the overall economic outlook was also relatively unchanged but lower average loans especially in lowerrisk portfolios drove an increase in the allowance for credit losses to of total loans even though our portfolio remains strong we have potential for even further improvement if lower rates materialize and inflationary pressures abate regardless we feel our proven conservative credit discipline continues to position us well to outperform peers through the cycle on slide third quarter noninterest income of million decreased million from the second quarter primarily due to noncustomer related income changes in the value related to our visa b derivative drove a negative million variance as we recognized a million loss in the third quarter compared to a million gain in the second quarter comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 risk management hedging income declined million as the lower rate curve reduced the amount of required collateral held at the cme while this resulted in a decline in noninterest income part of this benefited net interest income we saw encouraging trends in several customerrelated categories with increased syndication fees derivative income commercial lending fees and a small increase in commercial service charges fiduciary income was down but excluding the million seasonal taxrelated benefit in the second quarter it would have been up consistent with improved market performance we continue to be encouraged by the progress in targeted initiatives designed to further enhance noninterest income expenses on slide increased million over the prior quarter salaries and benefits were up million which included a million increase in deferred compensation which was mostly offset within noninterest income and various other smaller increases fdic expenses declined by million partially due to a million favorable accrual adjustment in the third quarter compared to a million expense in the second quarter both related to the special assessment in all we feel expenses were wellcontrolled and we continue to prioritize opportunities to drive positive operating leverage and improve efficiency as shown on slide our already strong capital position improved further in the third quarter solid profitability lower loans and conservative capital management drove our estimated cet1 to adjusting for the aoci optout our estimated cet1 would have been which is well above required regulatory minimums and buffers movement in the forward curve coupled with ongoing repayments and maturities in our securities portfolio resulted in a improvement in aoci increasing our tangible common equity ratio by over basis points considering our compelling estimated cet1 well in excess of our strategic target and the favorable movement in the rate curve we plan to utilize a portion of our excess capital to repurchase million of our common stock shares starting in the fourth quarter allocating capital to support our customers loan needs always remains our first priority so we intend to be measured in our approach and calibrate the size and frequency of future repurchases with expected loan trends we will also continue to closely watch the forward curve our profitability the broader economic environment and any regulatory updates as they may also influence our strategy moving to slide we do not yet have any meaningful update regarding the timing or specifics of the transition of the direct express program as a reminder our current contract allows fiscal service to utilize up to a threeyear extension under our current terms fiscal service would need to notify us of their intention to extend no later than early december so we expect to hear more before the end of the year however our expectation of the timing of deposit transition has not changed based on the size complexity and critical nature of this program our experience leads us to believe this transition may be longer rather than shorter we do not anticipate an impact to deposit balances noninterest income or expenses in fact it is possible we may not see a significant impact to average deposit balances in although we need more information on the proposed transition plan to confirm in the meantime we plan to continue prioritizing targeted deposit strategies aligned with our core relationship operating model to further enhance our funding position and prepare for an eventual transition our outlook for is on slide we project average loans to be lower than muted demand which we feel has been consistent across the industry and our deliberate optimization efforts in the latter half of are the major drivers for this decline with some customer optimism following the third quarter rate cuts and normal seasonal patterns we anticipate modest broadbased growth in the fourth quarter comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 one of the bigger variables will be our commercial real estate business as we believe loan balances in this business may have peaked depending on the pace and size of further rate cuts we could see a more rapid reduction in balances than projected in that business fullyear average deposits are projected to be down to from the slight reduction relative to last quarters guidance is driven by the expectation of an approximate billion decline in yearoveryear brokered time deposits not customerrelated trends further reductions in brokered time deposits are also driving the projected decline in average deposits in the fourth quarter as fourth quarter customer deposits are projected to remain relatively flat although were projecting some level of modest fourth quarter seasonality third quarter averages were elevated by large temporary customer deposits which were distributed by quarterend as expected based on the high interest rate environment we project deposit growth to continue to be concentrated in interest bearing accounts but we still expect to maintain a favorable deposit mix in the upper range we expect fullyear net interest income to decline to compared to the slight improvement relative to prior guidance is a result of our strong third quarter results fourth quarter net interest income is expected to grow over the third quarter or to adjusting for the impact of bsby cessation we expect noninterestbearing deposit pressures to be more than offset by benefits from swaps securities and the forward curve however we continue to watch noninterestbearing balances and overall pricing dynamics as they could impact results credit quality remains strong as we produce another quarter of low net chargeoffs interest rates remain elevated and as customers continue to navigate high borrowing costs and inflationary pressures we believe modest manageable migration will continue however given our strong results today we forecast fullyear net chargeoffs to remain well below our normal to 40basispoint range we expect noninterest income to be flat yearoveryear or down to when adjusting for bsby and the impact of the ameriprise transition this reflects a modest reduction in prior guidance due to trends in risk management hedging income although the lower forward curve benefited aoci and net interest income it does pressure this line item fourth quarter noninterest income is projected to decline to relative to the third quarter also driven by lower risk management hedging income despite this and other noncustomer related pressures we continue to be encouraged by customerrelated fee income trends fullyear noninterest expenses are expected to decline to on a reported basis and grow after adjusting for special fdic assessments expense recalibration modernization and the impact from the ameriprise transition fourth quarter expenses are projected to increase over our strong third quarter results or on an adjusted basis as detailed on the slide expense discipline remains a priority as we work towards our objective of positive operating leverage even with modest projected loan growth in the fourth quarter and the resumption of share repurchases we expect our cet1 ratio to remain well above our strategic target through yearend in all we expect a solid fourth quarter which would set us up nicely for a strong start to now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 this was an important quarter as an industry we saw the fed take their first steps away from a higherforlonger rate environment for comerica the actions we took to deliberately minimize our natural asset sensitivity position allow us to better protect our net interest income from lower rates additionally rate declines should be a net positive for credit quality and loans as customer profitability improves and they resume investing in their businesses coupling those tailwinds with our disciplined approach to credit and expenses along with the redemption of share repurchases creates what we believe to be positive momentum for generating compelling returns over time we appreciate your time this morning now wed be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed with your question curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning good morning so i wanted to dig in on deposits the average deposit rates went up a little bit this quarter i think in the prepared remarks you noted that there were some brokered time deposits that were higher early in the quarter that you paid down so maybe if you can expand on what drove those overall average interestbearing deposit rates higher and if you have it what the spot deposit costs are as of september or october whatever you have james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc good morning manan its jim thanks for the question we were really encouraged by the success we had in interestbearing deposits in the third quarter on average they were up billion and notably on an ending basis they were up billion now we know million of that was brokered but overall just really great success in gathering interestbearing deposits so i will say in the higherforlonger environment that we experienced through mid to late september i mean increasing pay rates has been somewhat of a common trend in the industry including comerica you couple onto that the fact that we had such great success in bringing in these deposits which by the way were very intentional weve been really successful in paying down wholesale funding in the last few quarters that trend continues with brokered deposits being reduced both this quarter and next quarter and were very happy to have those core interest bearing deposits even if we had to pay up just a little bit so i feel like the 8bp increase we had on a quartertoquarter basis was really in line not just with the industry but well in line with our intentions and our goal of just raising strong core customer deposits so its something we just felt really good about and think its a great value proposition comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and any indication on how deposit costs have ph had trajected since the fed rate cut james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah we are really projecting very closely to what weve been planning all along i will say the spot rate at the end of the quarter was maybe slightly lower than the month before as we started to see success with our pricing strategy overall indiscernible trended up a little bit as the quarter went on im always hesitant to give a very spot rate on a given day because it does move around a little bit but i will say that we are having success with our repricing a lot of work went into this a lot of strategy im really proud of our product managers for what they put together not just in terms of what were repricing but just some of the product designs theyve done to make sure that we have mix shifts that are mutually beneficial to both us and our customers but there will be a lot of moving parts and maybe just looking forward to the fourth quarter because i know thats really what youre interested in the success we had in repricing deposits i think really approached on a product basis something approaching our cumulative beta just north of so really happy about that but of course a number of other things are going on we are bringing in core deposits and being very successful in that and that puts a little pressure on the overall beta as we look to from third quarter to fourth quarter we do have a little bit of mix shift going on we do continue to survey both our customer reaction as well as the competition and what theyre doing and as i mentioned just a little higher jumpingoff point maybe at the end of the quarter than perhaps on average prior to that fomc cut so if you put all that together and theres a lot going on there a lot of variables i do think when we get to the fourth quarter youre going to see an overall beta relative to average fomc rate changes probably hovering somewhere between our standard beta of and that cumulative beta that we had just north of so thats something were really pleased about but i will say a lot of moving parts a lot of mix shifts again by design on our part as well as our customers so its something were just going to have to continue to monitor but so far a pretty successful outcome manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and do you think betas from there as we think as we look out into whats your best guess on whether deposit betas accelerate from there because we get through more rate cuts or do they roughly stay the same because i guess loan growth could be improving next year maybe help us with how youre thinking through that thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc first of all i would say the rate of cuts always depends on what kind of landing we have ive been very consistent in saying that and it does look like were going to have a soft landing which i think puts a little pressure on the pace of betas because its always easier to change rates when theres perhaps a little more fear in the economy which typically does a company a rate reduction comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 but the way i look at it is were starting from a strong position there are probably some midtier rates that were hesitant to move down at this point so i think the betas will pick up a little pace as we start to move through mid late i think they will accelerate a little bit and then theyll probably back off as some of those rates start to approach a floor and you need to pull back a little bit so itll be a little bit of a ushaped curve i suspect for the industry but again a lot of its going to depend on just what happens in the overall economy and what type of landing the economy has manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats very helpful thanks so much for the color james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your question curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning good morning on net interest income its good to see the upside guide despite the lower deposit growth expectation and your lower loan growth expectation and i know you mentioned a lot of that is partly given the third quarter performance and your fourth quarter expectation on nii the or the to up exbsby is noted given that curious if loan demand remains relatively modest and you still see some continued competitive pressures around deposit pricing how do you see nii trajecting beyond the fourth quarter i know looking out there it looks like expectations could be in the mid to highsingledigit growth for net interest income as we look into do you think that is reasonable if youve got some slower rebound in loan growth as we move into next year james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc good morning john its jim im happy to take that question overall were pretty bullish about net interest income in it does look like we hit an inflection point in the second quarter of this year thats even with a little bit of bsby drag in the third quarter so really pleased with how thats trending i would say as ive been saying i think the overall trend quarter to quarter to quarter beyond where were at now is going to be up there could always be some anomalous quarter whether it has to do with the timing of fomc reductions or day count or whatever you could always have a quarter where maybe it starts to plateau a little bit but i think the general trend is going to be just continuously increasing net interest income as we move beyond so thats something were really looking forward to we do expect loan growth on a somewhat continuous basis in so that will be helpful also i will say were not ready to give guidance for so im hesitant to comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 quote any specific loan growth numbers or net interest income numbers but i would say overall its a pretty nice picture in terms of just everincreasing net interest income as we move through the next not just few quarters but few years john pancari q analyst evercore group llc great thanks jim very helpful and then separately on if i could skip over to capital your cet1 of just shy of versus your target is certainly noted and i know you expect the resumption in buybacks of about million in the fourth quarter maybe could you give us at least a trajectory on how you feel about the possible acceleration of buybacks as you go through just given that type of margin where youre running right now above your target james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc i dont think were prepared yet to talk about we do acknowledge that were carrying very strong levels of capital now we do want to stay materially above our target of cet1 and frankly i think we want to stay above probably an well above an cet1 target because we want to make sure were ready for basel iii end game as it approaches even though those rules are not quite final yet but that still does give us a little bit of flexibility so we expect earnings to continue to be very strong going forward but we do have to as always continue to make sure we prioritize capital for loan growth and our customers we have to keep an eye on rates in the overall economic environment longer term rates and the curve shift up a little bit since the end of the quarter and again we are sensitive to whats going on with aoci and making sure that we dont get a surprise there we continue to monitor just profitability in the regulatory environment so its just something were going to have to monitor on a quarterbyquarter basis as we move through but we do feel very comfortable with our capital position and really proud of the fact that were starting the share repurchase this quarter john pancari q analyst evercore group llc great all right thanks jim appreciate it james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning jim maybe bigger picture for you can you just talk a little bit about your philosophy on hedging right now and your approach to rate management it feels like theres a better outcome on nii and the margin if rates fall further but just talk a little bit about what youre trying to accomplish and how we should think about nii trajectory and margin trajectory if the fed continues cutting james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc good morning jon yeah as you see at our sensitivity slide in the deck we are just very slightly liabilitysensitive actually a little less liabilitysensitive than last quarter but still slightly liabilitysensitive ive been saying that i really think of us as largely interestneutral theres always a somewhat of a fixed component of that sensitivity equation that ties back to balances in the assumption that noninterestbearing balances will grow if rates continue to go down and we may not get the full effect of that until we see a few more rate cuts and we had some type of inflection point in terms of how customers manage their money and so i dont necessarily expect to get the full benefit of that balance until we get a few more cuts down the road so as a result from a pure rate standpoint i really think of us as being closer to interest neutral and eventually well get the balanced benefit of that liability sensitivity also and so i dont see the rate picture really changing things materially for us on a quartertoquarter basis because we are so close to neutral and i think the real wildcard really for us is going to be deposit pay rates how competition and the customers react i think thats probably got a wider range of outcome than what you might argue in terms of asset and liability sensitivity assumptions so much closer to interest neutral the good news is i feel like we are insulated from any drop in rates and should be protected from that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and it feels like youre starting to get the early signs of maybe a little bit of customer acceptance to lower deposit rates is that a fair assessment james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah yeah i think so we feel and peter may want to comment too but ive been really pleased with how its received and our relationship managers are doing a great job shepherding these through and explaining to the customers and ill give credit to our customers they understand it and when they ask for rate increases as rates were going up and i think they understand that when rates go down we have to be a little bit symmetrical there and so overall i feel like its going really well peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc jon its peter i would echo that we feel like its going really well and were being very selective across each of our businesses i mean some of them we can achieve more success than others but i think our continuous ph messages about our relationship strategy and being able to have these conversations before our customers make moves is proving to be very successful so i would echo what jims comments are there comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay and then just one kind of a followup on johns question on loan growth but you talked you guys flagged a couple of times cre payoffs and maybe an uptick in cre payoffs but on the flip side maybe some better potential lending growth if rates do fall how do you kind of square that how material do you think the cre payoffs might be and this kind of gets to the loan growth question but is that just a real impediment to growth peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah jon its peter its certainly something were watching i think its yet to be determined of how much of a headwind it is or isnt i would say we feel like cre loans have peaked in the third quarter here and so it probably is sort of a downward slope as we get into next year now that said i think we feel like the rest of the portfolio will perform in the opposite direction and hopefully be able to offset that headwind so well talk more about outlook when we talk about our next call but at least as we sit today i think cre is probably a downward slope from here on and our expectation is with rates coming down further sort of where we feel like the rest of the portfolio maybe has bottomed a little bit thatll hopefully offset the headwind on cre jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you very much peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thanks jon operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bernard von gizycki with deutsche bank please proceed with your question curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning bernard bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank hey guys good morning so just a quick question modeling question on the risk management hedge income given the geography change so is there a rule of thumb on how much risk management income would decline and net ii increase on a basis points rate cut james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc good morning bernard i dont necessarily have a rule of thumb for you but you could probably look at how three to fiveyear treasuries move this quarter and draw a little bit of a conclusion relative to the previous quarter we said its tied to our swaps and our swaps do have a much shorter duration than our bond portfolio but we did see a shift of income as we mentioned in the script from noninterest income to net interest income you see that comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 on the noninterest income slide risk management hedge income was down million net interest income probably benefited from million of that in the third quarter and net interest income will continue to benefit from that in the fourth quarter so we do have some positive inflows in the net interest income and i think on the strength of those we did improve our outlook reflecting in part the great third quarter success and i do think as i look to that down to guide i do think we have a really good shot at being closer to the than the so we continue to look at really strong net interest income and i think that explains some of the weakness in the noncustomer portion on the noninterest income side bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank got it and then just separately i appreciate that the forward curve has changed it feels like its ebbed and flowed just even day by day but on slide of the deck you estimate the securities aoci unrealized losses declined by i think its about by the footnote i believe its the forward curve at and given changes in the forward curve since then theres like two less rate cuts priced in just wondering any idea of the impact from just higher forward curve versus the that i believe is assumed in that assessment james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc its been moving around quite a bit trending up somewhat so i dont really have a number for you as to where it sits today we do have some sensitivities on the capital slide that point to overall aoci and a large portion of that the vast majority of that relates to bonds so thats a little bit of a harbinger that you can look out there but overall well just have to wait and see where rates end up in the fourth quarter bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank okay great thanks for taking my questions operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from line of ben gerlinger with citi please proceed with your question benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hi good morning curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc just kind of high level a little more philosophical than anything so you guys stuck your neck out a little bit this year in terms of loan growth expectations and pleased by no means i feel like im picking on you because everyone seemed to and everyone seemed to walk it back a bit just because you have a little bit more of a national and commercial footprint than most of my coverage id say on average comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 when you think about kind of the impediments why is loan demand really wasnt there and is there anything that stood out ph is it other than just lack of rate cuts and then kind of as we go into next year i mean does political uncertainty actually fix anything or is there kind of inflection points on rates where you might see demand just kind of your thoughts on what youre hearing from boots on the ground level peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah ben its peter its a really good question i dont know that my story is any more compelling than maybe some of the other things that youre hearing but i think i would probably say that we all felt like some interest rate relief would really drive loan demand and i think thats kind of proven to be not necessarily the case so the feedback were getting from our portfolio was that basis points was nice but not inspiring necessarily and that really i think what most of the economies going to need to see is another basis points to basis points to really see some stimulation there so we certainly were feeling earlier in the year that the second half of we would start to see loan demand pick up and that really hasnt occurred so what does that mean for going into the future i think that probably it does become a little more of even a second half of conversation about what does loan demand look like in the economy and certainly getting to the other side of the election i think will be helpful because i do believe that business owners wait to make decisions until they understand what the tax outlook might look like for them i think to jims point continuing to see the economy kind of level out here but i dont know that theres anything more compelling other than to tell you that what we are hearing is that interest rates are going to need to come down probably another basis points to basis points to really start to inspire business owners to make more decisions here on investing capital benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats helpful i mean some clarity on the political front whether team red or team blue it definitely helped but i get what youre saying its kind of more of just lack of animal spirits across the board peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc but if you do if you did kind of have to rank order are there certain areas that kind of might be chomping up a bit like economically speaking that seem to probably want to take on a little bit faster or anything that comes to mind that might be kind of first out of the gate to increase loan demand peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc ben when you look at our portfolio i would say our national and specialty businesses have probably started to see a little bit more pick up across the board our pipeline feel like it actually has grown a little bit more in those businesses in the last quarter i think its really more general middle market ci where youre just going to have to have that reduction in interest rates to get the stimulant of borrowing comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 and to your comment about animal spirits i think your average middle market business in the country right now is just waiting for that interest rate relief so theyre not in a situation where they have to do anything if anything theyre building a little bit of cash theyre making good money why take any chances when they believe that the outlook on interest rates is really going to be in their favor next year on the other hand our national specialty businesses i think theyre going to kind of run their businesses i want to say despite interest rates but we are seeing some pick up there and so thats where i think you put all that together between sort of muted middle market growth cre coming down and some of our other specialty businesses picking up thats kind of where youre hearing us talk about sort of modest to flat loan growth going into the fourth quarter and possibly next year benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got it okay thats helpful thank you peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thanks ben operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your question curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning jim just wanted to get a better just understanding of the guide for  for nii the plus or the plus to the gaap was million in the third quarter is the math off of that im just trying to make sure i got the right nii for the fourth quarter james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc it is yeah its the printed number above that bsby obviously has about a million swing if you look at the bsby schedule that we have from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and again that schedules in the deck but yeah it is on the printed number christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so that would to get to that closer to down youd be north of million kind of ballpark for  james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah yeah pretty comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc probably closer to million yeah mid million to million christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay awesome and then second on ecrs the commercial bank its kind of a hidden deposit beta can you maybe opine about what lever that might be in the expense line over the next few quarters james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc i think there is a little bit of opportunity with ecrs as rates continue to come down our ecr has actually had a much lower beta than our deposits did so i do expect service charges to benefit over time as rates continue to come down and i think itll be noticeable but i dont think itll be huge itll be really just a fraction of what youre going to get on the pure deposit pay rate side christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thank you chris operator thank you our next question comes from the line of samuel varga with ubs please proceed with your question curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning sam samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning i just wanted to ask if you can put a maybe a finer point on the margin in i understand that youre looking to pay down some of the brokered deposits but just wanted to get a sense for i guess a finer point on how youre managing that extra liquidity and what your level of willingness is to move cash flow or move brokered lower and sort of protect the margin a bit more james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 hey good morning samuel we do expect the balance sheet to become a little bit more efficient as we move into the fourth quarter on a quartertoquarter basis we will see a little bit lower wholesale funding on average brokered deposits are where youre going to see the biggest change as we pay down quite a few almost million at the end of the third quarter and a somewhat similar amount as we move through the fourth quarter so we did inflate the balance sheet a little bit with excess cash supported by those higher level of brokered deposits because frankly the loan growth that we might have expected at one time when we took those brokered deposits out didnt fully materialize and so i will say that we expect improvement in the nim as we move into the fourth quarter i think many of you know on the call that i really hate talking about nim and i think yet again we have another example where net interest income increased even with the bsby drag yet the nim went down because of dynamics of the balance sheet so never really like to talk a lot about nim percentage having said that it is going to move up materially just because of a more efficient balance sheet and probably end up somewhere near 3handle as we move through the fourth quarter but a lot of that will just depend on just the various levers within the balance sheet and how they move samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc understood thanks for the color there jim and then the other question i had is just around the environmental services teams that you have and obviously youre pretty bullish just on the opportunity set here so can you talk a little bit more about the business in terms of the growth ramp with the teams that you have and what your expectations might be over the next couple of years in terms of where that business can go peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah sam this is peter so it is a business that were very proud of weve been at this business for a long time now a couple of years ago we started a renewables group as well that shows up in that line item and quite candidly our environmental services business has been a quarterly positive performer for several years now and i think that outlook will continue weve got a great team i think were the best in the business we continue to try to give resources to those folks so id be surprised to see anything other than the pace that youve seen the last few years continue in that space its a fantastic its really a great middle market business its a specialty business but the size of the loans the fee income that it generates its just a fantastic business for us and so its one that were going to continue to lean into and i would expect that on a goforward basis the growth rates would be similar to what youve seen in the last few years so thats how i would think about it that way if i were you samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for all the color appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james please proceed with your question comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning michael michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey hey good morning i think all but the nim and the loan growth questions have been asked so maybe ill ask on just the pace of future investments specifically as it relates to loan hires i think were hearing more commentary across other banks that hiring efforts are going to be a little bit more robust as we enter next year i wanted to get your thoughts there to maybe drive some incremental loan growth and then maybe any sort of update you have just in terms of costs related to eventually crossing the billion in assets thanks peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc michael its peter i might take the first one and then ill probably let jim take the second one i think the thing that youre exactly right the competition for talent is tremendous right now i think whether youre no matter which market were in no matter what kind of line of business you look at theres a lot of competition for talent i continue to believe that something that makes us very special is we have a fantastic training program where a lot of our relationship manager growth over the next few years is because of talent that we have hired and trained and developed and they go to market with that sort of culture and expectation and i think a better knowledge of credit than our peers and so that program is one that were leaning heavily into of trying to get folks into that program and out of it as welltrained and ready to be successful as we possibly can i think hiring from other banks can be successful but i also think its expensive and i dont think its necessarily the best way to grow your culture or your brand so i think that distinguishes us when you look at comerica from others as to why weve got a really good outlook there and so were intending to grow that population especially in our middle market and business banking businesses where weve got opportunities in texas and california and we will certainly add talent from other banks we do that all the time but i think that you put those two things together its a very compelling story as to why you would look at comerica compared to others and so jim i might flip to you on the billion number james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah specific to the billion efforts i always remind people that were one of two existing banks that have been in that regime in the past so weve been there we know how to do it we kept some of the practices that we had in place at that point in time of course the bar has gone up since then but we feel like we have really strong capital planning and stress testing practices liquidity stress testing practices when i look at what it takes to get ready for billion beyond just having that general good risk framework which were making great progress on the task that probably takes the most effort is just the data and all the reporting thats required and that has probably the longest tail on it and weve been working on that really for the last year yearandahalf were making great progress we plan on being done well ahead of hitting billion and so our goal overall is to do this in layer so that any one year theres not a huge step up in expenses we will ultimately have a higher run rate a modestly higher run rate because of billion in category iv readiness but were also working to offset those costs and my goal is to put it in context of youll never actually notice a big step comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 up specifically due to a category iv readiness effort because we are layering them in as time goes on and feel like were on a really good track to be ready well ahead of hitting billion michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful and then maybe the natural followup question as it relates to next year and im not trying to pin you down here but i think were hearing other banks at least plan for positive operating leverage next year i heard your comments on kind of nii trajectory balance that with maybe some expense growth related to what you just talked about but is it at least the initial plan or expectation that you can generate positive operating leverage next year thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc its always our goal to have positive operating leverage and obviously with the regional bank crisis and its trailing effects on made that very challenging but positive operating leverage is always our goal and i would say is no exception to that thats our own expectation and thats what we are shooting for and that will be through a combination of both revenue efforts as well as making sure that we calibrate expenses appropriately michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right great thanks for taking my questions james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator thank you our final question this morning comes from the line of anthony elian with jpmorgan chase please proceed with your question anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning appreciate the comments you provided on loan growth and customer sentiment towards quarter end just asking the question around loan growth expectations a different way once borrowers get past hurdles of the election and we see more rate cuts do you see a loan growth at the company at a level comparable to the rest of the industry or do you think you can grow faster than the industry just given your footprint and other segments you mentioned peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah anthony its peter id answer that a couple of ways we had a lot of years where we were growing at the rate of the industry if not even slightly below for a while but if you kind of went back so call it the noncovid the non2023 years we were growing at a rate equal to or above the industry so i think on a go forward basis particularly when we get to the other side of as i talked earlier about cre kind of downward slope from here i think we should be able to grow at the industry growth rate or better when we get into and that would be the expectation comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 and i certainly think when you look at our portfolio all of our specialty businesses being highly exposed in texas and in california we would expect of ourselves to be growing better than the overall industry and weve proven that we could do that the last couple of years absent sort of these major events so the only part of that i would just caution again is the cre headwind that we have but the rest of the book on a goforward basis we would expect to be able to grow better than the industry curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc peter i might just add too that when you look at this is curt that the markets we operate in really all of our geographies have grown this year and expected to grow next year above gdp so we feel really good about sort of the markets we operate in the national specialty businesses that peter referenced earlier part of our capital management strategy is to reserve capital for loan growth so we are anticipating loan growth on a forward basis where we feel really good about our funding position and credit continues to be very wellbehaved so were ready willing and able and weve got a great team on the field and back to the question earlier about relationship managers weve got plenty of capacity right now for growth but again we are building in additions of capacity through our training programs and selectively in some of our businesses external hires anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you and then my followup you saw good growth in equity fund services deposits during the quarter can you talk about what specifically you saw in that segment that drove the growth and the expectations for year end thank you peter l sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah anthony so i mean equity fund services has been a really good business for us in it was one that we did optimize quite a bit i think through last year we are seeing good success in that business its a little bit of a different environment there theres not maybe as much fund formation as there was for a while theres not as much activity in the private equity space as you know but on a loan outlook standpoint i feel like its sort of up from here we did sort of expect to see a little more growth in  it worked a little bit against us in august but i think thats starting to flatten out and on the deposit side i mean i just think were continuing to add sort of more what i would call bilateral relationships where were the only bank which leads to more deposits which leads to more treasury and fee income were trying to do less participations per se in that business and more bilateral deals and so i think were just capturing relationship and i think as events occur in the book that our customers have weve proven as a really good bank for them to place their deposits with and as we talked about earlier thats at appropriate rates across our portfolio anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that
