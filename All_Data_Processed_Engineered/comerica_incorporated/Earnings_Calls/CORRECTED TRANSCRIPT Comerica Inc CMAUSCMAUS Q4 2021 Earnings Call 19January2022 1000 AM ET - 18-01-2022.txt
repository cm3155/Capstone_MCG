through the process we funded over billion in the second round of ppp loans supporting more than customers as of yearend of these loans have been repaid mostly through the forgiveness process also to further demonstrate our commitment to our communities we made a pledge to lend billion to small businesses over a threeyear period our annual employee engagement survey was conducted and among our top strength comericas values stood out with of respondents providing favorable marks in addition of our colleagues agreed our response to the covid19 pandemic was excellent we listened to what matters to

critical customer journeys that make it easier for our customers to do business with us comerica has a rich history of helping our customers communities and colleagues thrive this focus is essential and foundational to effectively executing our relationship banking strategy turning to our financial results slide provides a few highlights we produced record earnings per share of average deposits grew and supported solid loan performance in a number of businesses while providing significant excess liquidity to fund future growth as a result total average assets increased to billion an alltime high credit quality was excellent and we released reserves our book value per share increased to over with strong market appreciation and our attractive dividend we generated a total shareholder return of one of the highest among our peers slide provides further details relative to we had average loan growth in several of our specialty areas specifically equity fund services environmental services entertainment and commercial real estate also excluding ppp we had positive trends in middle market throughout the year including a strong finish the growth was more than offset by a large decline in national dealer services due to supply constraints as well as energy as the sector recovered and reduced leverage revenue increased to billion while net interest income was challenged by the ultralow rate environment noninterest income growth was broad base increasing to a new record noninterest expenses reflected a higher compensation in conjunction with favorable performance and operating costs tied to greater revenue generation credit metrics were excellent as evidenced by net recoveries for the year a reflection of our careful customer selection diverse portfolio and a conservative underwriting culture as a result of strong capital generation we returned billion to common shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of what million or of total shares in summary a strong performance with an roe of over and an roa of comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 our fourth quarter results are outlined on slide we generated earnings of per share excluding ppp average loans grew over million led by middle market and corporate banking ppp balances declined nearly billion as the forgiveness process progressed also mortgage banker declined about million due to seasonal and cyclical factors average deposits increased over billion excluding ppp revenue increased as a result of loan growth and robust fee income credit quality was exceptional and we released reserves expenses reflected investments in our people and technology to support our revenuegenerating activities also we repurchased million in common shares and maintained an attractive dividend yield we expect economic metrics to remain relatively strong this year our chief economist forecasts world gdp to increase over in and we believe each of our primary markets california texas and michigan should perform at or above that level our customers and colleagues have successfully navigated the challenges of the past two years and today stand stronger and more confident about the future and now ill turn the call over to jim who will review the quarter in more detail james j herzog chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide as curt just mentioned excluding the decline in ppp loans we had solid loan growth in several businesses the largest driver once again was general middle market which was up over million on average relative to the third quarter in addition large corporate increased over million or and national dealer was up nearly million partly offsetting this growth were declines in mortgage banker and commercial real estate historically we have seen strong seasonal loan growth in december and this year was no exception average loans increased nearly million in december relative to november this helped drive periodend loans up billion relative to the end of the third quarter despite a million decrease in ppp loans this essentially reflected the same drivers that we saw on the average balances ill take a moment now to provide detail on the major pieces we continue to see positive trends in general middle market and corporate banking higher commodity prices and rebuilding of inventory levels are in part resulting in an increasing working capital needs ma and dividend or equity distributions are also drivers however there are some headwinds mainly related to supply chain disruptions and in some cases excess liquidity which can temper borrowing but overall our customers remain optimistic and that is reflected in our pipeline and growing loan commitment levels the increase in national dealer services loans included a small increase in floor plan loans which remained extraordinarily low relative to the typical historical run rate of about billion we expect inventory levels will slowly rebuild over the next one to two years as supply issues are resolved and pentup demand is satisfied mortgage banker declined as a result of cyclical as well as seasonal factors loans have slowly decreased from the winddown of the refi boom after reaching record levels at the end of however purchase activity has remained strong and therefore we should fare better than others in this space given that of our mix is purchase related while the industry average is commercial real estate was impacted by significant paydowns however loan production remained strong and our pipeline and line commitments increased in the fourth quarter loan commitments for the portfolio as a whole increased million led by corporate banking and middle market partly offset by a decline in mortgage banker the line utilization rate held steady at comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 loan yields decreased basis points including basis points from the impact of ppp loans basis points from swap maturities and lower average rates on loans with floors as well as other portfolio dynamics such as the mix shift in the portfolio as shown on slide average deposits again set a record increasing billion with nearly threequarters of the growth derived from noninterestbearing accounts this growth was due to fourth quarter seasonality along with continuing trends we have seen related to our customers solid profitability capital markets activity and various fiscal and monetary actions the average cost of interestbearing deposits hit an alltime low of basis points and our total funding cost held steady at only basis points slide provides details on our securities portfolio we continue to deploy some of our excess liquidity by increasing the size of the securities portfolio this mitigated the risk to the rate headwind resulting in a slight increase in securities income quarteroverquarter mbs purchases in the fourth quarter had average durations of about six years and yields of about basis points with securities rolling off with rates over basis points total portfolio yield declined to our goal is to prudently reduce our asset sensitivity at a measured pace in part this can be achieved through gradually deploying excess liquidity by opportunistically growing the securities book this has had the added benefit of helping to offset any pressure on revenue from lower reinvestment yields and maturing swaps turning to slide net interest income decreased million excluding an million drop in ppp income net interest income increased million the net interest margin declined basis points mainly due to a large increase in excess liquidity which had an basis point impact as well as the decrease in ppp income which had a basis point impact as far as the details putting aside the decline in ppp income interest income on loans was stable growth in nonppp loans offset the impact from lower rates on loan floors and a swap maturity as well as other dynamics such as a mix shift in the portfolio as i mentioned the increase in the size of the securities portfolio essentially offset the impact of lower yields a billion increase in average balances at the fed added million and had an basis point negative impact on the margin fed deposits were extraordinarily high at nearly billion and weighed heavily on the margin with the gross impact of basis points as far as credit which is outlined on slide our metrics remained excellent including net recoveries of million as well as another quarter of declines in criticized and nonaccrual loans our provision was a credit of million positive portfolio migration growing economic confidence and sustained favorable economic forecasts although layered with some degree of uncertainty resulted in a reduction in our allowance for credit losses to of loans however coverage of nonperforming assets increased to times through the cycles our credit performance relative to the industry has been a key differentiator and we believe we will continue to outperform we remain vigilant given potential stress on our customers from the omicron virus supply chain disruptions labor constraints and inflation noninterest income increased million as outlined on slide derivative income grew million and was broadbased with increased activity and interest rate hedges foreign exchange trading and energy derivatives deferred comp which is offset in expenses increased million from almost in the third quarter fiduciary comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 income increased million returning to the second quarters record level with growth in our trust business and continued strong equity market performance following strong third quarter syndication fees which were at an alltime high commercial lending fees declined million as expected government card activity declined as state benefit programs waned however this was mostly offset by increases in merchant and commercial card activity also boli income decreased primarily due to the receipt of the annual dividend in the third quarter in summary we are pleased with another very strong quarter which capped off a record year for fee income as shown on slide expenses were up million in the quarter in short this included the increase in deferred comp which is offset in noninterest income and higher tech labor as well as seasonal staff insurance and occupancy as far as the specifics salaries and benefits increased million as expected technologyrelated labor costs increased as they typically do at yearend as we completed a number of projects i just mentioned the impact from deferred comp and staff insurance also we incurred million in additional expenses that related to mid cycle indiscernible increases retention bonuses and severance costs as we work to ensure we have the best talent for our future needs in a very tight and competitive labor market this was partly offset by lower performancebased incentives following elevated third quarter levels in addition occupancy was seasonally higher also we had increases in legal expenses of million primarily related to strong yearend loan closing activity as well as operational losses asset disposition losses and te which are all captured in other expenses we continue to maintain our expense discipline as we position for future growth by investing in technology and our people which are key to our relationship banking strategy slide provides details on capital management loan growth combined with share repurchases resulted in a decrease in our cet1 ratio to an estimated we continue to closely monitor loan trends and capital generation as we focus on our cet1 target in addition we have maintained a competitive dividend yield as always our priority is to use our capital to support our customers and drive growth while providing an attractive return to our shareholders before we turn to the outlook slide provides an overview of our interest rate sensitivity models which forecast the benefit of rising rates to net interest income the standard model assumes a nonparallel rise in rates with a dynamic balance sheet at the end of the fourth quarter we estimated a million or increase in annual net interest income over months as rates gradually rise basis points and the benefit will be slightly greater in year two our asset sensitivity moved higher in the fourth quarter primarily due to the extraordinary deposit growth our goal is to gradually reduce our asset sensitivity over time as market conditions allow and as rates rise we would likely pick up the pace however as you see in the various alternative scenarios we have provided in all cases our assetsensitive balance sheet remains very wellpositioned to rising rates our outlook for is on slide and assumes no change in interest rates and a strong economy with gradual improvement of supply chain and labor challenges we expect average loan growth on a yearoveryear basis in the midsingledigit range excluding the decline in ppp loans increases in nearly every business exppp are expected to be partly offset by a decline in mortgage banker from continued normalization of refi volumes and lower national dealer due to a slow rebound as a result of the supply chain issues this belief is supported by our robust pipeline positive momentum in several businesses and our outlook for continued economic growth comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 as far as the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter we expect the average loans to be stable with growth in middle market large corporate and commercial real estate offset by lower mortgage banker and dealer we believe average deposits will remain elevated for the near future due to seasonality we do expect deposits to decline modestly in the first quarter and as far as net interest income the major driver is expected to be loan dynamics ppprelated income was million in and will not be repeated putting that aside the benefit from loan growth is expected to be partly offset by lower loan yields driven by lower rate floors on loans competitive pressures and a mix shift in the portfolio the first quarter will be impacted by lower ppp income and two fewer days for simplicity this outlook does not assume any rate changes however as i discussed on the previous slide we are highly sensitive to rate movements therefore rates are a key driver for our net interest income in furthermore as rates rise a larger than planned increase in our securities portfolio or adding swaps presents additional opportunity credit quality is expected to remain strong net chargeoffs are expected to begin to trend to the lower end of our normal range of to basis points assuming the economy continues on the current path and the impacts of supply chain issues labor constraints as well as inflation remain muted we expect the allowance ratio to continue declining modestly as far as noninterest income was the highest on record and included very strong performance in nearly every category some levels are unlikely to repeat in such as warrantrelated activity derivative income including favorable cva stimulusrelated card fees and deferred compensation these line items may also be a headwind in the first quarter however we expect continued solid performance in several customerdriven fee categories such as fiduciary deposit service charges and brokerage we expect expenses to increase in the lowsingle digits this includes inflationary pressures which could impact a number of line items such as salaries te and insurance also we are focused on product and market development as well as driving efficiency which means continued investment in technology we expect these headwinds to be partly offset by resetting performance compensation to normal levels of note our pension expense will improve by million for the year first quarter expenses are expected to be lower with the annual stock compensation more than offset by the decline in performance comp seasonal declines in items such as advertising and staff insurance and other items that are expected to decline from elevated levels in the fourth quarter such as deferred comp legal and severance costs we expect the tax rate to be to excluding discrete items finally as i indicated on the previous slide we are focused on our cet1 target of as we monitor loan growth trends now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim as i said in my opening remarks was an extraordinary year and we produced strong results many business lines have shown good momentum with increases in loans commitments and pipeline comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 also we produced record fee income and deposit growth as well as excellent credit quality revenue was up and our efficiency ratio held steady resulting in strong returns im honored to work along with such a talented committed and hardworking team with our expertise and experience we are building longterm relationships we are focused on delivering a more diversified and balanced revenue stream with an emphasis on fee generation which was evident this past year also our unique geographic footprint provides significant growth opportunities including the expansion of our southeast presence we will continue to carefully manage expenses as we invest in our products and services and make progress on our ongoing digital journey finally our disciplined credit culture and strong capital base continue to serve us well these key strengths provide the foundation for creating longterm shareholder value we are wellpositioned as we move forward in thank you for your time and now wed be happy to take some questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning thanks for the question im hoping we can start on the loan growth outlook i understand that the fourth quarter is seasonal but could you speak to the pipelines at the end of the year and i noticed the endofperiod loan growth was notably stronger than average thanks peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc chris this is peter yeah the fourth quarter is normally a good quarter for us although i think this quarter was exceptionally good from years that weve had in the past and it does feel really good about jumping off for our periodend was really strong the pipeline continues to be above prepandemic levels i will say it came down a little bit just with closures through the second half of the year but still really good compared to history and so as we said in our outlook we feel really good about where we stand at this point in the year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and maybe a followup understanding the deposits are continuing to surprise to the upside you mentioned a couple times in your prepared remarks the likelihood to grow the investment book to take down rate sensitivity im interested kind of in the pace of securities purchases if you kind of layer in the fed the futures curve thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 yeah chris its jim happy to take that question and good morning christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc morning james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc there are a number of different ways this could go weve seen quite a bit of rate movement just in the last couple days so take your pick as to where rates may go in the outlook we do assume just modest increases in our securities portfolio as you may have observed weve been increasing them by about billion on average per quarter were actually assuming something just slightly less than that in this baseline outlook that we have but again thats got the potential to really take a step up whether we choose to do it with securities with cash products or maybe choose to do it with swaps off balance sheet those are somewhat interchangeable to an extent that will be driven by what we see in terms of the rate outlook and certainly were willing to step that up and will want to step it up as rates go increasingly higher so it really comes down to monitoring the environment and responding to it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and is there a max of which the size of the investment portfolio youd like to manage in this environment james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thats going to be highly dependent and we are observing on what goes on with liquidity and the economy both short term and long term theres a little bit of flux right now in terms of what the fed might do with its balance sheet longer term and so were going to observe that and make our call off of that we think in the short term there is some room to grow it how much room there is to grow it remains to be seen again based on just where we see overall liquidity and deposits in the system going but its not really a concern of ours because if we do hit some type of limit and we will hit that limit at some point we dont want to grow the securities book inappropriately or indefinitely but we always have the option to put on a tremendous amount of swaps in terms of the capacity we have for that so again it will be interchangeable between those two instruments and well just monitor overall liquidity and market conditions christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for taking the question operator your next question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 morning on the loan growth again to the endofperiod how much of that growth that you saw endofperiod commercial balances represent any type of pullforward on liborbased loans given the change to sofr in the beginning of this year did you see any of that out of your commercial borrowers peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc hey john its peter i think the short answer to your question is no i dont think the shift from libor to sofr is necessarily causing any increase in loan demand or changes there i think the borrowing community is continuing to make their decisions for their businesses and sort of navigating that shift in use of libor to sofr separately john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thank you and then separately can you regarding rate sensitivity i get a fair amount of questions from investors around your rationale for driving your asset sensitivity lower or another way maybe pulling forward some of that asset sensitivity particularly now that we have relatively high certainty regarding the timing and magnitude of expected fed hikes so if you could just walk through that again in terms of the rationale of pulling forward or driving lower your asset sensitivity given that james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah john its jim happy to do that and i will say in talking to both investors and analysts i see a variety of opinions and its interesting i hear some saying you should hold off and i see some saying why arent you taking advantage of this and moving faster and to me those opinions are equally divided our answer is that we want to be measured and methodical in terms of how we do this to the extent you hold off for higher rates and look to hit that homerun someday theres obviously opportunity costs or carrying costs that youre imposing upon shareholders over that short to medium term so thats something were very cognitive of we also know from the last decadeplus theres no guarantee that rates will go perpetually up and they can turn at any time with the black swan events that weve seen and so on over the last several years and so we are going to move very methodically but were not going to move all at once either because we are cognitive of the fact that rates could go higher and higher so we think steady and consistent progress makes sense and weve been moving on this but again were moving at a pretty measured pace to your point we are leaving some there in the kind of outquarters to make sure we take advantage of what could be a persistent rise in rates but were not going to sit on the sidelines and wait for that homerun someday either so we feel really good about being in the middle of the road and just making consistent measured progress john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks jim and if i could ask just one more sorry if i missed this earlier but can you just give us your thoughts on how do you think your betas will project as we get these hikes through the year thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc we have those sensitivities on the interest rate sensitivity slide and i think its fair to say that we have a pretty good chance of staying at or below that beta alternative that you see there that would be consistent with what we saw during the last rate cycle and rate started going up and actually theres more liquidity in the system comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 right now so i would actually be surprised if we dont replicate that performance so i think betas will be very wellbehaved for the first few hikes and well monitor it from there john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay great thanks jim james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess just sticking with loan growth two questions there one i was wondering if you can comment around what youre seeing across the different markets california versus texas versus midwest and also how much of the growth outlook depends on supply chains easing at least to some extent or do you feel like there is growth ex any of that happening that should emerge this year provided we dont have any big disruptions on any additional disruption from covid peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc ebrahim its peter ill take the second one first i dont think that were necessarily expecting resolution one way or another around supply chain on our outlook so we feel good about the outlook regardless although i think youre seeing as much as we are that there is some positive indicators of whats going on in supply chain particularly in the second half of the year but i dont know that its part of what were communicating to you outlook as far as the markets go it feels really good in all three markets michigan and texas had really great year sort of all year california came on really really strong in the second half of the year and especially in the fourth quarter so i think all three markets are positioned very well going into and the customer sentiment is positive i think in each of those so ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just one followup maybe more strategic as you look through your peer set right a lot of them have gone through large ma over the recent years and have doubled or tripled their asset sizes when you think about just relative positioning just talk to us in terms of competitive disadvantages of scale that you have your appetite to engage in ma that could increase size and market penetration just how are you thinking about all of that comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah this is curt ill take that question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hi curt curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc nothing has really changed for us there our model has forever been built really on relationship banking and organic growth we are in some very attractive markets and very fast growing markets especially texas and california and weve had opportunities to expand our franchise for example our entry into north carolina and the southeast and well continue to look for opportunities to do that more on an organic basis and we think our size where were operating today makes us nimble so to speak weve got the right sort of scale weve got the right talent in place in great markets weve invested in technology i think to meet our customer needs and really feel like we are not well be patient around any ma activity if it makes sense for us to do so but we really feel like weve got great opportunities just to continue to grow organically we will look for and we have looked for in the past possibly some small fee income tuckin opportunities along the way if it really helps us expand or enhance capabilities but well do that in a very strategic manner ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks curt operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc morning steven anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi morning this is anthony elian on for steve my first question on loan growth so general middle market up about million this quarter did you see these middle market borrowers draw down on their deposit balances before using their credit lines or are they drawing on their credit lines while still holding elevated cash peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc anthony its peter the second or the latter part of your statement there i think were seeing good growth in middle market borrowings and were still seeing pretty good deposit growth in middle market in general and ive said in the past i think your average middle market company continues to be optimistic but making sure theyve got access to capital both on their borrowing side and maintaining good liquidity so this has been something weve seen now several quarters and i know all of us are kind of wondering is there going to be a shift in that strategy and so far we have not seen that so both continue to be occurring comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then my followup on slide you outlined some of the technology investments you made last year including in data centers and modernization are these similar areas that you expect to invest in this year or anything new youre targeting for investments thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah anthony its jim well certainly see some of those trends continue but in addition we do see ourselves maybe shifting the emphasis a little bit more towards customer product were there already you see treasury for instance listed there but i do think well see more and more higher proportion of our investment in technology go to customer product sets especially those that we want to be the best in as the leading bank for business but as i mentioned in my script too were also focused on technology in the back room operations making sure the application systems are up to speed and making sure that our employees are efficient so youll see some of these same trends continue but again i would probably add that youll see some additional shift into kind of leadingedge digital customer products anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc morning gary gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning jim in your prepared remarks i think you mentioned that first quarter average loan balances are expected to be flat to the fourth quarter does that represent a decent amount of just kind of pull forward temporary balances whether in middle market or in large corporate at yearend that would kind of get paid off early in the new year james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc gary i would say its actually more typical of just what ill call general seasonality of our customers now those things you mentioned could be a piece of it but they are the types of things we see every year i think if you went back years you generally see the first quarter not as strong as the fourth quarter so its got an element of a lot of things really just inherent of our customers overall business models and their capital needs and funding needs in the first quarter so really a number of things but just overall seasonality i would say gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay and thats even with the kind of greater than usual strength in the fourth quarter comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thats right gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay okay and then just a followup on the comments around technology weve seen a decent flow of announcements in terms of banks adopting different kind of payment networks around kind of digital and blockchain technology are you seeing any kind of pull from your customers on that and really is that any part of the other kind of maybe newer products that you were referencing going to peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah gary i think the short answer is no not really on the blockchain technology part of it our focus when we talk about digital is really around customer experience and making it as easy as possible for our customers to do business i suspect things will be over time how things unfold with blockchain and so forth will be interesting to see were watching that but its not what were talking about on the investments that jim mentioned curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc peter i might add there and gary that we are early adopters of payments technology so we were one of the early adopters of the zelle platform and have had good success with that with our clients and we are adopters or have realtime payments capabilities in place both for sending and receiving and theres not a lot of demand for that yet in the industry but were positioned to leverage that to make sure our customers are taken care of gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co great thank you operator your next question will come from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc hello bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning curt i wanted to follow up with a high level question on your comments around investing in your platforms and digital tools to make it easier for customers to do business with you do you have any interest in getting to the point where you can leverage technology to expand your footprint through digital channels without the need for traditional ma is that something that youd have any interest in pursuing curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 yeah the way i think about technology certainly we need to be digitallyenabled and we need to have the right products and services that our customers are wanting and demanding both commercial and consumer customers but when you think about our model with a heavy focus on commercial banking that is still very much an advisorybased business its a relationshipbased business where were bringing a lot of credit expertise and overall banking expertise to client conversations and digital help enable some of the things that we do but its challenging to acquire a large company lets say that has million in top line revenue using some sort of digital application we need to support the relationship treasury management and other services with digital but really our model is still driven pretty heavily on the human capital side and the talent and skill and expertise of the bankers that we have in place and its part of what allows us to grow as an institution for example our expansion into north carolina doesnt have to be based as much on brickandmortar as it does on having the right people in the right places and many of our national industries or industry verticals we operate nationally today in many different markets new york boston chicago dc seattle washington et cetera bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you separately jim i wanted to follow up on your comments regarding higher salaries and comp expenses can you parse out for us how much of the increase is simply related to performance versus how much of the increases are inflationary and do you think that lowsingledigit growth in the expense outlook is a sustainable level even as rates rise james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah good morning bill yeah its really been a strange couple years as i mentioned in the last earnings calls its been a while since weve had a socalled normal expense here and really just really for all the major line items we are forecasting lowsingledigit expense growth for i do think that if the inflationary trends continue that would actually be challenging to maintain we probably see something a tad higher but well see where wage inflation goes and competition for employees one of the things that allows us to keep to the low singledigits next year not just for expenses but for salaries and benefits too is the fact that we are resetting performance comp so we would probably be a tad higher than lowsingledigits if not ph for setting the performance comp and where things go beyond it is going to depend in large part where wage inflation and competition for talent goes bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thank you lastly if i could squeeze in one last one following up on your deposit beta commentary there seems to be a pretty broad consensus that deposit betas are likely to remain just as low as we saw in the last rate hiking cycle but one of the variables that seems to be a bit more pronounced this time around is the risk of fed balance sheet runoff happening a little bit sooner can you frame how you guys are thinking about that james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc i see that more as an opportunity than a risk because even though the fed may unwind its balance sheet a little quicker than they did the last time keep in mind its starting from a much higher spot so even if they do that i do believe that deposits will likely stay a little higher than they were prepandemic level and i dont know that theyre going to unwind the entire balance sheet but if they do its going to take probably two to three years comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 they did go a little shorter this time in terms of how they built it up but i see a worstcase scenario as they unwind it back to where their balance sheet was before the pandemic started so worst case you might get back to liquidity in the system from where we started but theyre probably not going to go quite that far in addition we do see fiscal spending likely staying at some elevated level bbb did fail but some form of its probably going to pass and from what weve seen in the past its really a combination of monetary policy the fed balance sheet and the multiplier effect of money meaning activity in the economy which is highly linked to fiscal spending and thats probably going to continue so overall i do expect deposits to stay at least if not higher than what they were prepandemic levels so i dont see it as a risk and i actually see it as an opportunity that they dont actually unwind quite as far as some people might think bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you for taking my questions james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc youre welcome operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning everyone maybe ill start with a question for jim and maybe melinda how do you want us to think about the provision to kind of set the bar for that it seems like credit is very very clean but just curious if we can get us any help on that melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah this is melinda thanks for the question obviously weve had sort of unprecedented credit performance this last year and as jim mentioned in his comments i think we do expect that well continue to see the reserve level come down modestly over the next couple of quarters and at some point obviously given the fact that we are projecting some nice loan growth we would expect that well start to see that trend reverse a little bit and well start to see a little bit of reserve build but its really impossible to predict what the seasonal coverage ratio is going to be and what the reserve level is going to be because the accounting exercise that we go through each quarter is very specific to what the portfolio looks like what the credit metrics are at that time and what the economic forecast is so our general thought is well continue to see that coverage ratio decline a little bit and then itll start to level off and well be adding at some point for loan growth which will be a positive jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay youre just not seeing anything in terms of inflows really in terms of problem credits comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 melinda a chausse a executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc the credit quality of the portfolio continues to be very strong all of the indicators at least at this point are that what we would expect credit to remain very very strong this quarter we did however use some of the qualitative process in that reserve calculation to account for any uncertainty just because of the current omicron inflationary pressure wage pressure et cetera but again no signs right now on any of the segments of the portfolio that would give us any level of material concern and again we still have very high reserve levels to handle whatever comes at us jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you for that jim on slide on the rate sensitivity slide just so we understand it the standard model youre assuming four hikes throughout the year just kind of ratable hikes in terms of that modeling is that right james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thats right you can look at it that way its bps on average so you could think of it as four bp hikes evenly spaced jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so if we think thats the case and we think deposit betas will be lower would you pull us back at all from if i think its a deposit beta is there anything in there youd pull us back on if i just said well gosh maybe the current guidance has a little bit lower net interest income but if i think we get four rate hikes its another million in nii anything in that guidance that makes you nervous and youd say dont do that jon james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah ill give you one put and one take and they both have the potential to be very significant the takeaway is keep in mind the fourth quarter interest rate sensitivity was really enhanced by the deposits towards the end of the year so to the extent those take a step back as we think they probably will you could end up with a sensitivity closer to what we saw in the third quarter so well just see where those seasonal deposits go so that would be the takeaway the add would be to the extent to the earlier question from john to the extent we pull some of this forward and put swaps on the books grow the securities portfolio a little larger than we think at least within the first year or two you have the potential to pull some of that forward and actually add more net interest income so those are a couple one put one take and you can layer that on as you wish to the standard model jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then just one last one you talked a little bit about seasonality in deposits in  how are you thinking about overall balance sheet growth balance sheet size in is it more of a mix shift or do you expect to grow the balance sheet james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 well deposits have been driving the balance sheet its all about deposits since loans are obviously far less than our deposits right now so its really a question of where the deposits go and thats going to be highly dependent i think on fed actions there are two primary things that will affect it one will be rates because we know as rates go up well see some of these deposit slip off balance sheet off balance sheet money markets and i dont think thatll happen in the first couple hikes it looks like money market rates are going to trail for a little while here but as rates progressively go up you will see the deposits start to slip off and then what the fed does with the balance sheet indiscernible conversation but all thats going to take time so other than a little bit of a seasonal drop in the first quarter i would say the first half of the year youre not going to see the balance sheet change much deposits will stay strong and then towards the second half of the year maybe more partway through the third quarter and the fourth quarter youll start to see deposits come down if the fed moves as we think they will but its going to be a strong deposit level no matter what so funding is not a concern and we think its going to be a very healthy balance sheet going forward jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc hello pete peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc yeah good morning morning curt i wanted to ask about capital in the past youve talked about that you wanted to reduce some of the asset sensitivity before you would consider lowering the cet1 target so can you just ballpark how much lower you would need to lower before maybe you consider lowering the capital target and then secondly just as you near the capital target today of and a better outlook for loan growth just what youre thinking about in terms of share buybacks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah to the longerterm question of targeted capital ratios thats really yet to be determined we know that we have almost bps of preferred capacity to fill the stack with i dont think that means we would necessarily one for one lower our cet1 target by that same amount but there would be a little bit of room there but that discussion is really a couple years away until we smooth out the asset sensitivities ive talked about in the past and obviously an internal discussion and a discussion with the board and just the overall environment and the status of some of our constituents and their views so more to come on that but we do think there is that potential as weve mentioned in the past to take cet1 lower once that net interest income stream has ph smoothed out in terms of the more near term ending at an estimated theres always a plus or minus bps to where you end up with the capital ratio i really consider us to be about there and i will say we are going to be cautious in the near term about share repurchase were very hopeful we feel good about loan growth over the next several quarters we think capital generation meaning net income is going to be very good especially if we get comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 rate rises but thats not a guarantee it hasnt happened yet yeah we do think the loan growth is going to come so were going to be a little cautious on share buyback and i think youll see us hanging a little over as opposed to a little under going forward and well continue to monitor the environment for both capital generation and where the loan growth might be headed over the next several quarters peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thats great and then just one followup question just the deposit growth and middle market lending has been really strong last few quarters im just wondering could you just talk about how much maybe is coming from new customers and if youre doing anything differently to attract new business peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah peter its peter sefzik a portion of that is coming from new customers id say its probably in middle market and i dont know that were necessarily doing anything new i do think our model is proving itself out though in an environment with a lot of disruption you have seen some acquisitions of banks in our markets and the reality is that were benefiting from that both with customers and with talent so i think that all of those things are kind of coming together and working really well in our favor and proving out the model nicely for comerica curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc peter i might add that we would say the same thing about our other business lines in wealth management and in our retail bank that its probably even split between existing customers and acquiring some new relationships for some of the same reasons that peter talked about the key for that what im saying there though is that word relationship we do not chase deposits from a pricing standpoint we really try to leverage relationshipbased pricing and relationships overall in terms of deposit growth these are customers that we either have or customers that were acquiring in terms of deposits which is part of why weve done a good job of maintaining or performing well from a beta standpoint when you see a rising rate environment as this is not hot money these are really relationshipbased deposits across all three of our businesses peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for taking the questions operator your next question comes from the line of steve moss with b riley securities curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc morning steve steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc hi good morning just following up on rate sensitivity with the billion in floors you have just kind of curious as to how in the money those floors are just basis points basis points get some color around that comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah steve its jim happy to take that we do have the billion of floors at an average rate of bps so how far theyre in the money you can just subtract monthly libor from that most of our loans are on monthly libor those are hanging around call it bps youd see a bps in the money but of course thats going to be dynamic as we go through the coming rate environment i mentioned floors as a bit of a headwind in terms of some of the bps received as well as the absolute amount being realized on those floors i think everyone understands out there that to the extent the fed raises rates it really renders the floor issue a bit of a mood issue since eventually libor will likely be equal to this level of floor that were getting so we think this is a challenge that may end up not being a challenge at all if the fed moves as everyone is expecting over the next couple quarters steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc right okay thats helpful and then just in terms of investment securities just kind of curious what youre seeking to purchase these days in terms of new money yields james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah were going to stick to our philosophy of buying highquality securities where we understand the prepayment stability characteristics favorable capital treatment no credit risk so were not going to change from the philosophy we have in terms of what those are yielding its really changed a lot even in the last week so well see what the future brings you saw that in the fourth quarter we were making purchases ph at we saw that take a step up just a week ago and we saw it take a much further step up just in the last day or two so were monitoring that very closely but it certainly got the potential to create some nice opportunities for us in the coming months and quarters steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc all right thank you very much operator ill now hand the conference back over to curt farmer president and ceo for closing remarks curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc let me close by again saying a word of thank you to our
