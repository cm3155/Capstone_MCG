third quarter our results included solid loan growth in a number of business lines which was overshadowed by the headwinds from ppp loan forgiveness and reduced auto dealer loans due to supplier constraints we continue to drive strong deposit growth robust fee income and excellent credit quality revenue increased quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear despite the low rate environment our focus remains on managing expenses while supporting our revenue generating activities also during the quarter we repurchased over million shares reducing our share count by over we expect economic metrics to remain relatively strong over the next year which bodes well for growth our corporate mission is to create shareholder value by providing a higher level of banking that nurtures long lasting relationships key to achieving this mission is our dedication to our customers employees and communities our green loans and commitments continue to increase and totaled billion at quarter end

responsibility related report which were recently published these reports include updates on our strategies in progress in these important areas turning to our thirdquarter financial performance on slide significant progress was made on ppp forgiveness reducing these loans by billion or on a periodend basis supply constraints continue to impact auto dealer floor plan loans which average only million relative to the historical run rate of about billion putting ppp and dealer side the average loans and the remainder of our portfolio grew about million or nearly over the second quarter including a increase in general middle market our pipeline is strong and loan commitments continue to increase average deposits increased or billion to another alltime high this is due to our customers solid profitability and capital markets activity as well as the liquidity injected in the economy through physical and monetary actions net interest income increased million benefiting from an additional day in the quarter higher loan fees and deployment of excess liquidity partly offset by lower rates credit quality was excellent with net chargeoffs of only basis points and criticized loans have declined to well below our longterm average as a result our reserve declined again and we had a negative provision reserve ratio of reflects the positive outlook for the economy in our portfolio fee generating activity remained robust third quarter noninterest income was up on a yearoveryear basis on a quarteroverquarter basis record warrant income and commercial lending fees were all set by decline in card fees from elevated levels due to lower levels of government stimulus our efficiency ratio held steady at as we continue to focus on supporting revenuegenerating activity this includes our technology investments which help us attract and retain customers and colleagues by enhancing their overall experience and efficiency we remain focused on our digital transformation by enabling our business with products and services modernizing our platform and building a digital future with the right talent skills and strategy as we said it earlier we continue to manage our capital levels keeping a close eye on loan trends and capital generation using our capital to support our customers and drive growth remains our top priority while providing an attractive return to our shareholders we along with our customers and colleagues across our markets remain optimistic about the future we expect economic metrics to remain relatively strong over the next year our chief economist forecasts world gdp to increase in with each of our three primary markets of california texas and michigan above that level which bodes well for growth and now i will turn the call over to jim james j herzog chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide ppp loans decreased billion to end the quarter at billion as the forgiveness process accelerated excluding the decline in ppp loans we had good momentum in several business lines specifically weve driven consistent growth in general middle market equity fund services environmental services and entertainment this growth was partially offset by decreases in national dealer services and mortgage banker industry data shows that auto and dealer inventory levels are at a to 25day supply versus the typical to days due to challenges resulting from chip shortages labor constraints and foreign nameplates shipping issues we believe our dealer floor plan balances are very close to the bottom and inventory level should start to slowly rebuild mortgage banker loans also declined of note our mix is beneficial with of our loans tied to purchase activity the expectation is that refi volume should continue to fall as rates increase however purchase activity should remain relatively strong comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 as far as line commitments we posted another strong quarter with an increase of over million and growth in most business lines usage also grew resulting in the line utilization rate holding steady at loan yields increased basis points including basis points from the net impact of ppp loans and basis points from higher nonppp fees this was partly offset by a 3basispoint impact from lower rates which included swap maturities deposits continue to grow in nearly every business line hitting a new record as shown on slide the majority of our deposits are noninterestbearing and the average cost of interestbearing deposits remained at an alltime low just below basis points our total funding cost held steady at basis points with strong deposit growth our loantodeposit ratio decreased to slide provides details on our securities portfolio we deployed some of our excess liquidity by increasing the size of the securities portfolio by billion or million on average this allowed us to mitigate the rate headwind resulting in approximately the same level of securities income quarteroverquarter mbs purchases in the third quarter had average durations of around six years and yields of about basis points with securities rolling off with rates over basis points the total portfolio yield declined to our goal is to continue to offset any pressure from lower reinvestment yields by gradually and opportunistically increasing the portfolio size turning to slide net interest income grew million primarily due to an increase in the contribution from loans however the net interest margin declined basis points due to the large increase in excess liquidity as far as the details interest income on loans increased million and added basis points to the net interest margin this was driven by one additional day in the quarter which added million higher loan fees and balances on nonppp loans together added million and the impact of ppp with higher fees netted against more balances added million this was partly offset by lower libor and a swap maturity which together had a million unfavorable impact as i mentioned we neutralized the drag from lower securities yields on interest income by increasing the portfolio size a billion increase in average balances at the fed combined with a 5basispoint increase in the rate paid on these balances added million and had a 10basispoint negative impact on the margin fed deposits remained extraordinarily high at over billion and weighed heavily on the margin with the gross impact of approximately basis points given our assetsensitive balance sheet the recent steepening of the yield curve is a positive sign for the future our models estimate an increase in annual net interest income in the first year when rates gradually rise basis points and of course the incremental income in year two compared to the year one increase would be yet higher credit quality was excellent as shown on slide net chargeoffs were only million and included million in net recoveries from our energy business line nonperforming assets decreased and remained low at basis points of loans also criticized loans declined to nearly every business line and are now below of total loans with help from the rise in oil and gas prices the energy portfolio had significant decreases in both nonaccrual and criticized loans strong credit metrics combined with our growing confidence and sustainable economic growth resulted in a decrease in our allowance for credit losses our total reserve ratio remains healthy at overall our customers quickly adapted and navigated a very challenging environment however we remain vigilant given the potential stress on our customers from supply chain disruptions labor constraints and inflation comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 noninterest income declined modestly to million following a very strong second quarter as outlined on slide warrantrelated income increased million to an alltime high due to robust ipo and ma activity similarly commercial lending fees were also a record driven by a large increase in syndication fees deposit service charges grew million as a result of an acceleration in customer activity also boli income increased primarily due to the receipt of the annual dividend as expected government card activity declined as stimulusrelated volume waned however this was partly offset by increases in merchant consumer and commercial card activity deferred comp asset returns which is offset in noninterest expenses were less than million compared to million in the second quarter also derivative income declined million due to reduced customer appetite for interest rate hedges partly offset by robust energy derivative transactions with oil and gas prices hitting multiyear highs fiduciary income decreased from a record level in the second quarter as continued strong equity market performance was more than offset by the absence of annual tax service fees in summary we are pleased with another very strong quarter for fee income as shown on slide expenses were up million in the quarter salaries and benefits increased million mainly due to an increase in performancebased incentives which was partly offset by a decline in deferred comp also we had higher software and consulting costs as we progressed on our digital transformation journey and occupancy expense was seasonally higher in line with lower card fee income outside processing decreased million litigation costs decreased following the elevated second quarter levels and finally fdic insurance declined due to strong credit quality and higher capital ratios at the bank level our stable efficiency ratio is consistent with our commitment to maintaining our strong expense discipline as we invest for the future slide provides details on capital management our cet1 ratio decreased to an estimated we repurchased million shares in the third quarter under our share repurchase program we continue to closely monitor loan growth trends and capital generation as we manage our way towards our cet1 target in addition we have maintained a very competitive dividend yield slide provides our outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter excluding ppp loans we expect loan growth in several businesses including general middle market and large corporate partly offsetting this growth we expect continued decline in mortgage banker due to lower refi volumes and seasonality of note we believe auto dealer floor plan loans are close to a bottom ppp forgiveness is expected to continue and the bulk should be repaid by year end as we look forward to next year we believe loan growth from yearend to yearend should be relatively strong supported by a robust pipeline and expectations that the economy will remain strong we expect average deposits to remain elevated as customers continue to generate and maintain excess balances we expect net interest income in the fourth quarter to be impacted by a decrease in ppprelated income from million in the third quarter to be million to million in the fourth quarter exppp we expect net interest income to be relatively stable lower fees from elevated third quarter levels and to a lesser extent maturing swaps are expected to be mostly offset the benefit from nonppp loan growth as far as next year putting aside the headwind from the decline in ppp income we expect to benefit from loan growth as i discussed earlier we were highly sensitive to rate movements so assumptions for rates are a key determinant for net interest income expectations including the impact of maturing loan floors and swaps credit comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 quality is expected to remain strong assuming the economy remains on the current path we believe the allowance should continue to move towards our prepandemic dayone cecl reserve of as far as fourth quarter noninterest income we expect continued solid performance in several customerdriven fee categories such as deposit service charges card and derivatives particularly foreign exchange more than offsetting this growth we expect a decrease from record levels of warrant and commercial loan fees as well as elevated boli we expect noninterest income will be one of the highest weve ever recorded certain line items such as card warrants and derivatives including cva may be difficult to repeat as we look in the next year and we assume deferred comp which is offset in noninterest expense will not repeat however we expect strength in growth across many other fee income categories we expect expenses in the fourth quarter to be relatively stable as we continue to invest for the future technology investments are expected to rise as they typically do as we approach year end in addition we expect seasonally higher occupancy advertising and travel and entertainment expenses this is expected to be offset by a reduction from the thirdquarter elevated performancebased incentives our planning process for next year is underway big picture we expect compensation to normalize in however inflationary pressures could impact a number of line items including salaries also we are focused on product and market development as well as driving efficiency which means continued investment in technology this is particularly important to ensure we continue to be wellpositioned to assist customers and colleagues given the prospect of a strong economic growth for the foreseeable future we expect the tax rate to be to excluding discrete items and finally as i indicated on the previous slide we plan to continue managing towards our cet1 target as we monitor loan trends now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim overall we are pleased with our results many business lines showed good momentum with increases in loans commitments and pipeline also fee income was robust deposit growth was strong and credit quality was excellent this resulted in revenue growth and a steady efficiency ratio in spite of the low rate environment we continue to feel good about how well we are positioned for the future particularly our ability to support our customers in this extraordinary environment with our expertise and experience we are building longterm relationships our unique geographic footprint provide significant growth opportunities we are located in of the top fastestgrowing metropolitan areas including the expansion of our southeast presence earlier this year we are focused on delivering a more diversified and balanced revenue stream with an emphasis on fee generation we will continue to carefully manage expenses as we invest in our products and services and make progress on our ongoing digital journey finally our disciplined credit culture and strong capital base continue to serve us well these key strengths provide the foundation for creating longterm shareholder value thank you and now wed be happy to take your questions comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks hey good morning i wanted to ask you about some of the loan growth expectations on slide you show that million in average loan growth for the quarter without ppp is the message that  and were going to see numbers greater than that million on a net growth basis exppp i guess getting to how optimistic are you on because it seems like maybe were just getting started in terms of the commercial loan growth cycle peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah jon this is peter ill take that i think were very encouraged about what we see for as we sit today our pipelines feel really good ive said in the past that were above prepandemic levels and weve seen now a couple of quarters of really good growth in our general businesses and we expect that to continue for sure we feel really good about what that looks like for the fourth quarter and going into absent any major further disruptions you might see with covid or so on i think were very encouraged about what were seeing across our businesses and across most of the geographies and so id say the answer is we feel pretty good about what that outlook looks like jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so basic message is take out ppp were going to see growth in the fourth quarter and it just builds from there in thats what youre saying peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah yeah jon i think thats fair the ppp adjustment is one you got to navigate jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay jim maybe one for you the also on slide the long yield piece of it i think if you take out the ppp impact that you flagged it seems like relatively stable loan yields can you talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes on that james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 yeah jon and good morning to you yeah theyre relatively stable we did have some elevated fees in the third quarter as i mentioned it probably gave us about bps more than we would typically have during the quarter and we did get some pressure likewise going the other direction from a little bit lower libor and the expiring swap that we had at the end of june that carried through the third quarter and that probably put about bps of pressure on the yields in the third quarter as you look to the fourth quarter we will continue to have a little bit of pressure from libor continuing to sink its not significant and we do have a swap maturing in early october so i expect between the swap and the lower libor to get about bps of pressure in the fourth quarter and then of course were going to have the more loan fees going to other direction the bps that were elevated are going down a little bit so those are really the big drivers outside of ppp which obviously has the biggest impact that you would have to back out jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you jon operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everyone wondering if you could provide some color on the deposit growth quite strong and the outlook remains pretty good i guess what are you seeing with your customers in terms of sustainability james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah ill take that and then peter can add any color that i might miss overall were pretty bullish on deposits we continue to see some growth and being a kind of a middle market commercial bank they are lumpy at times but having said that beyond any lumpy deposits we might get we are seeing a pretty broadbased across all businesses so in general its just very solid growth im not surprised by that i mentioned i think previously at conferences or earnings that to the extent the federal reserve continues to inject liquidity into the economy and to the extent we continue to have some fiscal spending that in my opinion pushes the velocity of some of the money supply i think well continue to see growth in deposits so it will continue to be strong and even though the federal reserve may begin tapering later this year theyre still going to be injecting liquidity into the economy shortterm rates will or course stay low probably for the next few months at least so i dont see any of this escaping our balance sheet in the money markets and so on so my message would be its going to stay relatively strong over the next few quarters comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then if i could add a followup given the investments in the bond portfolio and rates moving up how should we be thinking about this remix from cash into investment securities the pace of growth james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah certainly liquidity is not an issue with over billion of excess reserves at the fed and again i dont expect deposits to go anywhere in the near future liquidity is certainly not a binding constraint its really more about pacing ourselves and being opportunistic as it relates to rates and i think weve been pretty steady slow but steady in that regard were up almost billion over the last year in the securities portfolio so thats about million a quarter thats been pretty consistent i think as you see rates continue to tick up assuming they do we could ramp that up a little bit more and be a little bit more opportunistic over time but our main theme has been we dont want to step into this too quickly given the potential for higher rates but again were not necessarily satisfied with standing pat either so slow steady progress is central mantra and weve been pretty consistent there and well just monitor rates over the next quarter or two and see where they go and well be opportunistic as appropriate there christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you chris operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys hey thank you for taking the question i just want to go back to that the loan growth outlook for just a moment as we look to some of that strong outlook for next year maybe what kind of thoughts do you have on where you see utilization trending i think youre now pretty stable at that range and then i was hoping you could speak to maybe if theres any difference in utilization rates and sort of your billion of general middle market versus what you might be seeing from some of the larger corporate customers peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah scott its peter good thanks for that question i think well probably see utilization rates start to creep up a little bit we saw a little bit of growth in general middle market and call it business banking this quarter compared comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 to a number of our other businesses and i think thatll probably continue i think back to this deposit question though the one we get a lot is which of these is going to happen first deposits come down utilization go up and i think our message continues to be a little bit of both one thing about the deposit growth is we were adding new customers and so not all those customers are borrowing a lot of money right now but we are capturing deposits and treasury management and other business with that customer acquisition and believe that eventually their borrowings will pick up on their facilities so i think scott to answer your question i think utilization rates will creep up i dont think theyre going to go up quickly because they do we do think those deposits and liquidity will stay on the balance sheet and i do think youll see it faster in kind of middle marketbusiness banking before you will per se in large corporate who continues to access the capital markets and handle their balance sheets a little differently r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah that makes sense definitely appreciate the thoughts peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah thanks scott curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks scott operator your next question is from the line of john pancari with evercore curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning back to the to the loan growth comment again this discussion as you look into given that you expect that steady improvement in line utilization how should we think about a reasonable pace of loan growth in as drawdowns really pick up i mean is it is growth likely to approximate gdp could it exceed that just how should we think about it as were modeling out next year thanks peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah john i would think about it probably on the whole is gdp and i think we feel like were in markets that are going to grow better than that and i would tell you that the results weve seen out of our michigan and texas middle market groups have been really good this year california has been good its not been as maybe robust as michigan and texas but we think that will pick up next year so i think its fair to say that we feel like were in economies and markets that are doing better than gdp and i also think that were going to be losing some of the major headwinds weve had the last few years of energy the comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 dealer story i think you guys are pretty familiar with and so yeah i would say that looking to gdp and knowing where our geographies are maybe compared to others is the way id be analyzing that john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thats helpful and then i know you mentioned wage inflation inflationary pressures in your in the end of your outlook can you maybe help us size up how youre thinking about the impact of wage inflation on yearoveryear expense growth i know couple of your peers have kind of size it up in the lowsingledigit impact to expense expectations as they complete their budgets how are you thinking about that james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah good morning john we are still in the process of putting the plan together were seeing a little bit of inflation already start to get into the run rate even though i wouldnt call it raw material but anecdotally it does feel like its going to keep ramping up and as we do our planning we do think that it has the potential to add perhaps another to what might be normal expense levels but thats still bouncing around a little bit and yet to be determined as we finish our planning but i certainly think its going to be a factor i think its going to be something thats noticeable as opposed to underneath the covers and well get more clarity on that over the next few months john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you very much i appreciate taking my questions james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning good morning i wanted to follow up on your interest rate sensitivity commentary to the extent that the fed proceeds were tapering asset purchases come to an end by the middle of next year and we start to get some hikes but the short end of the curve rises faster than the long end such that we get some flattening is that scenario consistent with the nonparallel shift in rates that you highlight on slide i just wanted to confirm that comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah if we look at our modeling it it is an unparalleled shift and we do have long rates going up theyre not going up nearly at the same rate as shortterm rates but they are up so under our scenario and baked into our interest sensitivity metrics that we quote in the deck we do have a modest increase in longterm rates but most of the shift in terms of bps and dollar impact of course is tied to the short end bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats very helpful and i wanted to separately on the topic of asset sensitivity but perhaps an area that doesnt get as much focus on the fee income side i wanted to ask about the credits that your business customers earn on the deposits that they hold with you and are able to use to offset fees can you give some color around how much those fees are suppressing fee income today and what the potential fee income benefit could be as we look ahead to higher rates james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc higher rates tend would have a detrimental effect on the fees to the extent that eca goes up so i wont necessarily see that as an opportunity of course were going to more than make that up on the net interest income side but its right now its not a real material number just because rates are so low but you would get a little bit of pressure on the noninterest income line item to the extent rates go up and that earnings credit goes up bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got you okay and then i guess maybe lastly if i could squeeze in one last one is there any color you can offer on the extent to which you expect ppp customers that were new to comerica that to the extent theyre continuing to engage with you in other areas in the future and to the extent that thats an area that could drive some incremental revenue going forward peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah bill its peter right we actually kept our ppp program very focused on existing customers and so i think our opportunity that weve seen as it relates to ppp is really working with customers in the past who had been sort of depositonly and then i would say thats very much in the kind of small business retail space and so its certainly been a chance to engage in that relationship and build from there bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc great thank you for taking my questions peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc thanks bill comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks bill operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning good morning i guess just going back i think jim you talked about supply chain labor constraints and inflation as a factor i think when you were talking about credit but just talk to us even from a loan growth perspective when you think about these three issues just the level of visibility you have in terms of supply chain and labor constraint issues getting resolved and how much of that loan growth optimism is built on that occurring because i think weve discussed a lot of that over the last few months and would appreciate any kind of clarity that you might have talking to your customers on those fronts curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah ebrahim thats a great question i think its sort of one that were all looking at and evaluating every day and what i would tell you is that we just continue to be really impressed with our customer base and how theyre navigating each one of those challenges so to the extent that any of those speed up or are delayed as we get into the fourth quarter and into next year that probably will impact i think on the whole obviously how the economy performs but we feel like our customer base continues to be really really strong make good decisions through all of this its a little bit like looking at when we all sort of had to take a step back and evaluate choices that were going to be made by customers through covid and many of them came through that very strong matter of fact a number of them sort of better results than theyve ever had and i think as we move forward each one of those issues supply constraints labor et cetera are going to continue to be challenges and not necessarily new ones labor has been a challenge i think for a while now in the general middle market space so yeah i cant tell you any more than i think you guys are seeing in the press just like we are but what i can tell you is that our customer base is optimistic theyre figuring out ways to navigate all of those issues whether its being more productive through technology just like all the rest of us are or finding different ways to navigate the supply constraints were seeing really really good performance and i think that will continue ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just as a followup obviously oil and gas prices are pretty strong just talk to us in terms of what you are seeing are we going to see if prices stay where they are are you going to see some more demand and investment going back into the energy sector or do you think just the impact from the last few years is so harsh where its going to take a lot longer before you see energy loan demand pick up comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc i think the answer to both of your questions is yes i think that its going to take a little longer for loan demand to pick up in the energy space but i do think youre going to see some capital flow i dont know that youre going to see an enormous amount of lets call it private equity capital flow or public market capital market flow so itll be slow i think as it relates to that but we have started to see a little bit of loan demand were being very selective about the choices we make there and i think that the commodity price runup is not necessarily one thats going to just draw a whole bunch of capital to the space or new players per se i think sort of the existing population is going to be the ones that are sort of navigating this price spike right now ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yes thanks ebrahim operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone morning i wanted to first follow up on the expense commentary curt with all of the expense initiatives you guys have had over the past several years with all the impact of the pension plan costs in i actually cant remember the last year that you had a normal year of expense growth if we put the inflation impact on salaries aside what do you consider a normal year like a normal growth rate for expenses putting the inflation aside james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah steven its jim and your comment is right on point ive been asking myself the same question what is the last normal year we and the industry has had and its certainly not the last couple there have been an incredible amount of puts and takes over the last couple of years so i typically like to go back to at least to set a baseline but having said that our goal is to be at or below the rate of inflation thats kind of what we use as our governor you probably have to go back to kind of a starting point and cagr it from there just to see how you measure up to that from that standpoint we feel pretty good about it we are making some investments in areas that i think are going to pay off and we feel really good about and of course well be in a position to talk more about that at the january conference call as we kind of lay out expectations for but we are keeping an eye on expenses we comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 are trying to selffund to the extent we can but were very committed to making the right investments in the people and the systems and as i mentioned in my comments at the opening we feel really good about the economy and we feel like now is the time to be there for the customers and take advantage of what might be really good growth over the next two or three years curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc jim i might just add this is curt that our expense discipline around how we manage the resources and head count has not changed thats been ingrained in our company for a long time and we have continued to gradually become more efficient in terms of head count and reduce head count over time a lot of that leveraging technology and really changing dynamics and how customers utilize banking services with more customers utilizing mobile banking for online transactions et cetera has helped us continue to be very efficient there at the same time weve done a very good job and peters area is an example of that of reallocating head count where we feel like we have a higher growth opportunity in certain business lines so that remains a sort of key area of focus for us i do think when you get longer term were not the industrys not there and were not there yet either but with a lot of companies including us offering more flexibility and work schedules there will be a point where we can start really thinking more about real estate weve done good work there already but were continuing to evaluate sort of what does our real estate footprint need to look like i dont think thats a nearterm or even a necessarily a initiative but that will be another area that we can look at and are looking at in terms of the next couple of years steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and if the goal is sub or at the inflation rate or lower does that imply i assume you mean the longterm inflation rate not current inflation does that imply sort of or lower is that the thought james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc well see where that goes its really hard to say steven were in such unchartered territories in terms of where the inflation rate might go but i think youre kind of in the ballpark there steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc and as always steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 i just say as always well provide more guidance as we get through the planning process and on the january conference call for  steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yes yes and then secondly given that general middle market customers i mean youve said it multiple times already are sitting on elevated deposit balances im curious are you seeing elevated loan paydowns today and do you think theres a risk i know youre bullish on loan growth for next year but that at some point these customers use these balances to pay down their loans just given how much liquidity theyre sitting on thanks peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc steven its peter i good question i dont we arent seeing that so far is there a risk of that occurring possibly i think that as we get through the end of the year we kind of get through some of the tax determinations for customers do they make some different choices about what their balance sheets look like i mean maybe so as we get into but i think the reality is that theyre going to want to continue to maintain i just call it kind of insurance i mean theres just so many things that seem to be happening in the economy that they need to be prepared for so they want to have access to capital so having availability in the range is probably good for them and having liquidity on their balance sheet i think is good for them and it gives them a lot of ability to go pick up struggling competitors acquire talent as needed et cetera so i dont think that were going to see that happen i could be proven wrong there but is it a risk of course it is but its not one were seeing right now steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay i appreciate all the color thanks peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc yeah operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hi good morning i just want to ask you to comment on the rate sensitivity in the swaps and floor strategy last quarter you said that adding swaps at this point didnt make that much sense and im just wondering youve got a little bit rolling off now just as you look forward what do you look to change that view in terms of adding swaps either getting it out the nii or bringing a little bit forward into the income statement versus just waiting for that great loan growth that youre talking about thanks comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc all right ken yeah thanks for the question and that is something that is on our mind as i look at the current environment and our own balance sheet we still have a lot of liquidity we still see a very large differential between swap rates and what might be available versus what might be available on the security side so we still see a pretty lopsided value in terms of adding securities in lieu of maybe adding swaps at this point in time having said that as you point out we do have some swaps maturing we have seen the swap rates edge up a little bit and so i could see us moving over the next quarter to potentially into a little bit of a dual strategy there there are a little bit different dynamics and advantages that each of those classes offers but for the most part i think well be putting the preponderance of our spending of assets sensitivity into securities but i do feel like were getting a little closer to the point where we could start adding some swaps and have a little bit of a dual strategy going there ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay and on the floor side just i guess as it relates to just pricing in the market can you just talk a little bit about what spreads are looking like out there across the portfolios and how your strategy with floors plays into new production thanks peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc hey ken its peter i dont typically talk about what spreads are looking like on the call i will just tell you that pricing is very competitive floors we are still getting some floors were probably getting a little lower floor rate than we were days ago certainly six months ago but the pricing in general is very very competitive out there and we stick to our belief that we provide really good value to our customers and were very disciplined about pricing and so were not going to maybe give into pricing declines across the board were going to do the right thing for our customers and were going to try to capture market share but it is a very competitive pricing environment and floors is a part of that formula we look at it on every single deal trying to get one and sometimes we are able to accomplish what we want to there and sometimes were not ken usdin q analyst jefferies company understood okay thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks ken operator your next question comes from the line of steve moss with b riley securities curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steve comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc good morning just following up on rate sensitivity here jim i think you said in your prepared remarks that the securities purchased this quarter had a duration of six years kind of curious in terms of what is the overall duration of securities portfolio and should we expect you to purchase more longerduration securities going forward here james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah steve thanks for the question we think our duration is pretty manageable right now it stands at years which is pretty consistent with the industry we did have a little shorter duration perhaps compared to others if you go back a year or so so we felt like from that standpoint we could afford to add more duration in addition we just have an incredible amount of asset sensitivity so i would even be comfortable as rates continue to go up perhaps even seeing that go up by year just because we do have that sensitivity and if rates go up were going to be cheering like crazy even though some of the securities might not carry the same value of that point in time so i do see us from a value standpoint when i look at some of the yield differentials and supplydemand dynamics were actually okay right now with the sixyear point in terms of incremental ads and again thats mainly driven by the fact that we have so much asset sensitivity i think more than any of our peers and i think its just something we can afford to do at this point in time steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay great and then maybe just one more on endofperiod deposits were about billion above the average kind of curious if that was just more windowdressing at quarterend or is that should we think of that as the a better run rate for the fourth quarter average balance james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc a little bit of both we did have a little bit of a spike up towards quarter end and its not unusual but the overall what ill call mediumterm trend through the quarter all the way through the last month we did see deposits rising so a fair portion of that will stick with us steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc all right great thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi great thanks good morning james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc hey ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess my first question i think it was jim you mentioned that youre reinvesting into securities to help keep basically to offset lower reinvestment yields if i heard you correctly and i certainly understand the desire to keep income fairly steady over time and i know i understand why youre doing it but shouldnt those really be separate decisions i mean i guess im asking like would you still invest in sixyear duration securities at these levels if you werent trying to keep income stable thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah ken thats a fair comment and i will kind of characterize my comments earlier as more of a convenience it is nice that the asset duration that were interested in right now coincidentally does allow us to keep securities income consistent quarter to quarter but i think your point is very well taken and it probably bears some clarification were comfortable with our strategy right now were comfortable with the duration we think its the right way to go given our assets sensitivity we think it makes sense to walk into a in a slow sense the larger securities portfolio and i jump in too fast and its really kind of a convergence of two desirable outcomes its stepping into the right direction and the right size securities book which kind of coincidentally allows us to keep the securities income constant quartertoquarter so you are right theyre different kind of considerations but they really converge nicely for us right now curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc ken i think longer term ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc this is curt maybe just a comment about longer term i mean i think all of us two years ago would have been surprised to have had the opportunity to build the securities portfolio as large as we have but weve also never seen this level of liquidity in the economy and in the system and so for the prepandemic when we were loan deposit ratios and then 90pluspercent range versus in the today thats a significant swing and so sort of first and foremost for us is always leveraging liquidity as well as capital to lend to our customers comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 but short of that were going to be prudent in sort of how we allocate the excess liquidity we have and try to generate earning assets for our shareholders i think we can balance both of those and over time to right size of the portfolio well sort of itll seek sort of an equilibrium based on normal growth in the portfolio where deposits grow over time and we can sort of flex that portfolio either up or down really based on as maturities occur and really what the dynamics look like as we get six months a year or two years out and we really know sort of what normal what normal looks like because nothings been normal in the last months ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i hear you there second question how much of the positive loan growth commentary that you have for is premised on national dealer rebounding and then what would loan growth look like potentially if national dealer did not rebound peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc hey ken its peter i think that when were thinking about loan growth for next year im really thinking about dealer as i dont want to say not contributing to that but being a slower contributor to it it certainly feels like the floor plan and the return to normal in that space is kind of moving into the lower for longer approach if you will and what the timing on that comeback we continue to believe is into the second half of next year as we alluded to in the comments we think were at the bottom i mean million in floor plan balances is about as small as we can get i suspect the fourth quarter will come down a little bit more but what the outlook for dealer is it is very difficult to determine in this environment customers give you feedback that they believe that eventually we will be in what weve seen in the past and the amount of inventory thats on dealer lots but today if you go buy a dealership there are no cars out there and i think thats probably going to continue further into next year than maybe many of us have thought but from a balances standpoint we think were at the bottom itd be nice to have some uplift next year we feel really good about the rest of the portfolio if you will and are encouraged by that outlook and so it will be interesting to see what does happen in dealer ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then just want one silly little question on slide here on the deck it says that average loans grew million but then you list six different items that are all positive and they add up to billion of growth is it just some of those lines be negative james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah ken there was a refiling of the slide earlier this morning so you might have the original publishment but national dealer and mortgage banker are both negative so that was thats negative ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc perfect sorry all right great thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks ken operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning mike eric chan q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi this is actually eric from mikes team hey so i have a curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc hey eric eric chan q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey so twopart question for you guys firstly its regarding your total tax spend for the firm so just wanted to get a sense of what that was this year and what your expectations are for the growth trajectory for that spend over the next couple of years and then secondly as it relates to the realtime payments that you guys recently wrote out so kind of wanted to get a sense there of what the uptake has been there for that as well and how you guys kind of expect that to impact revenue and expenses over the next couple of years james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc okay yeah maybe ill take the first part of the question in terms of the tax spend and that is something we have not externally published just because in my opinion you get a little bit of apples and oranges in terms of how companies define that and some of that tax spend is often sitting in the business units depending on what shade of gray youre considering to be tech but well we have looked at it i will say that our percentage of tax spend as we view it as a percentage of expenses is very much in line with the industry comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 the shift that weve seen at comerica and our new leaders in the service company have done a great job of this is weve seen a little bit of a shift between what we call run the bank versus build the bank and so we are starting to put more of our tech spend in the project development many of those customer systems digital initiatives and just basic business infrastructure and so the buildthebank portion of it is growing and it will grow again in so we feel good about the direction there and then in terms of realtime payments and what thats done for us certainly thats been well received by the customers we feel like were a little bit in the front end of that compared to some other banks out there its a key part of our treasury management offering and its just something that were happy to offer i dont know if you would say anything else peter peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc eric i would just use it as an opportunity to tell you that were very very focused on being a leader in the treasury manager space when it comes to digital and making sure that we are the leading bank for businesses in that offering and its a big focus right now for us and one that were going to continue to hopefully deliver new ideas and products in over the next couple of years eric chan q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats helpful thanks and then just following up on the run versus build the bank so what is that allocation now for you guys i know its going to be growing in the both the bank portion but what is that now and just kind of get a higher level sense of that james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah that is something weve not publicly disclosed perhaps we will at some point in time but ill just say its been a nice shift for us over the last couple of years and continues to trend in the right direction eric chan q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks eric operator your next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co yes good morning i just had another followup on rate sensitivity slide of the billion of libor loans with floors looks like thats about half of the liborbased loans can you segment out how far in the money those are is there any are we talking about bps bps et cetera in terms of moves in libor that would get through those floors comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc yeah those carry a gross floor of bps which if you net that against the to bps libors its got an average positive carry of about bps to bps in terms of trends if you look at the various slides weve published externally at earnings and conferences and so on we have seen the amount of floors continue to grow but the bps received or the bps of floors starting to slow down a little bit and is shrinking a little bit each quarter up till now thats been a bit of a wash in the last few months or the last quarter or so thats something were monitoring very carefully we do have more maturities coming up related to floors in the next year and so thats something we have our eye on and as i kind of implied in my opening comments it could be a bit of a headwind next year but having said that we do have loans coming up for renewals that never had the opportunity to get a floor and so we view that as an opportunity and of course we have new customer activity where theres an opportunity also so depending on where all that nets out will likely tell us where the net impact and the net positive carry of floors is going but i would say during its more likely to be a modest headwind as opposed to a tailwind going forward gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay thank you and then following on your prior comments on maybe some incremental interest in adding swaps versus where you were previously in terms of the billion that is scheduled to mature in is there any particular lumpiness within the year in terms of that they might be looking to replace james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc thats actually pretty smooth throughout the year and i think some previous decks that we published actually had it by quarter but if you assume that smooth throughout the year youd be almost spot on in terms of the overall impact in gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thank you james j herzog a chief financial officer executive vice president comerica inc the one i will say the one in the fourth quarter is i think i implied it earlier that one is very early october so thatll be a full quarter impact operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning question can you play more offense in your markets given some of the ma activity i think of california where a large legacy name is going to go away and even in texas you went from a fourletter bank to a threeletter bank so to speak and then just as a followup as you think about your budget for next year are you willing to invest in any of these opportunities peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc terry its peter the short answer is yes we think so and i think that the longevity of our company and our people is proving really really good in markets like california and texas that were going on years in now and the sort of disruption bodes well for us with customers prospects and talent so we are looking really hard at it and were going to be opportunistic i think is the word i would use and see what we can do i dont know that were going to be i think youre you said go on offense maybe thats a right terminology but i think id say opportunistic and be selective and we really feel like theres going to be some great opportunities for us with this disruption appreciate that question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you peter l sefzik a executive vice president executive director commercial bank comerica inc thanks terry operator i would now like to turn the conference back over to curt farmer president and ceo curtis chatman farmer chairman
