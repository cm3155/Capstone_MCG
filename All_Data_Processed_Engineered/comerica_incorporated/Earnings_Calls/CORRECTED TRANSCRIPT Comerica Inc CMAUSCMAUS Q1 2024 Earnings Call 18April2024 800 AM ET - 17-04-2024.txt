reported first quarter earnings of million or per share although loan demand remained muted we continue to see improvement in customer sentiment translating into increased pipelines and signaling opportunities for growth our historically strong deposit franchise demonstrated resilience as deposits outperformed expectations and normal seasonal patterns these favorable trends enabled continued normalization of our liquidity even as we reduced wholesale funding by over billion throughout the quarter in fact over the last four quarters we repaid almost billion in wholesale funding of reserving significant available capacity beyond our financial results we were incredibly proud of recognition received for our efforts to prioritize our employees and communities greenwich award showcased our successful focus on small business and we see great potential for continued growth in this space comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 earlier this month we hosted an event at our new collaborative workspace in north texas and our second large office transformation is underway in michigan as a product of our modernization efforts these business and innovation hubs leverage advanced technology designed to meet the evolving needs of our colleagues and customers through dedicated business centers immediate feedback has been overwhelmingly positive and we feel this workplace strategy will be key to attracting and retaining talent while offering unique benefits to small businesses and local communities first quarter financial highlights are on slide average loans were impacted by rationalization efforts from including the exit of mortgage banker finance which is now substantially complete deposits outperformed expectations and in fact would have been relatively flat excluding the deliberate reduction in brokered time deposits net interest income was impacted by lower loans slightly higher deposit costs and one less day in the quarter but overall performed better than projected credit remains strong as net charge offs moved even lower this quarter both noninterest income and noninterest expenses were impacted by notable items and we saw a discrete benefit to taxes prudent capital management and lower loans drove an increase in our estimated cet1 to even higher above our strategic target stepping back strong liquidity credit and capital supports our solid foundation and positions us to prioritize responsible growth in the second half of the year now ill turn the call over to jim to review our financial results in some more detail jim james j herzog chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc well thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide impacts from intentional balance sheet management efforts in carried over into the first quarter and when coupled with soft demand drove downward pressure on average loan balances lower utilization was a trend in both middle market where customers use deposits to repay debt and invest in their business in equity fund services where we observed continued softness in private equity activity conversely commercial real estate utilization continued to trend higher as we funded multifamily and industrial construction projects while managing commitments lower as we look monthtomonth throughout the quarter we saw balances decrease only modestly and a steadily increasing pipeline which together support our expectation for growth slide highlights the stability of our deposit base average deposit balances declined million but almost million was attributed to lowering brokered time deposits otherwise declines in technology and life sciences equity fund services and commercial real estate were largely offset by increases in general middle market entertainment and retail in fact retail balances are nearing premarch levels with growth in both small business and consumer our mix of noninterest bearing balances remained a competitive advantage averaging for the quarter as both interest bearing and noninterest bearing deposits exceeded expectations as anticipated elevated rates continue to drive deposit pricing higher to basis points in a cumulative beta of however the pace of increase continued to flatten as it has for the past four quarters our deposit profile remains a competitive strength and we were encouraged by this quarters results as shown on slide we normalized our liquidity position and in this quarter alone we are able to repay over billion in wholesale funding while retaining significant capacity over the last year our liquidity strategy proved effective as we added liquidity to navigate volatility and then methodically normalized our position as the market stabilized we were incredibly proud of our billion debt issuance in late january a record issuance for comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 comerica investor interest was high and the execution was effective which to us signaled progress towards more normal market activity and interest in our value proposition at our loantodeposit ratio remained below our mediumterm target positioning us to prioritize highreturn loan growth going forward periodend balances in our securities portfolio on slide declined with continued paydowns and maturities in addition to a million negative marktomarket adjustment from a higher forward curve we expect continued decline in this portfolio over the coming quarters turning to slide net interest income decreased million to million driven by lower loan balances and higher deposit pricing partially offset by fed deposits and lower wholesale funding while lower noninterest bearing balances also contributed to the quarteroverquarter decrease deposits overall outperformed expectations with favorable deposit trends lower fhlb advances a moderating deposit beta and a million noncash bsby ph accretion net interest income exceeded guidance as shown on slide successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the composition of our balance sheet positions us favorably for a gradual basis points or basis points on average decline in interest rates by strategically managing our swap and securities portfolio while considering balance sheet dynamics we intend to maintain our insulated position over time as a reminder bsby cessation does not impact the ongoing cash flow associated with the swap notionals listed on the slide while we took noncash losses in the fourth and first quarters we will accrete them back with the majority coming back into net interest income in and now that we have fully redesignated the remaining impacted swaps we have included quarterly bsbyrelated net interest income projections in the appendix for your modeling moving to slide we expect the attrition of our swap and securities portfolio to create positive earnings momentum scheduled swap maturities outpace the remaining forward starting swaps in by the end of we expect lower overall notional balances and a 14basispoint increase in swap yields creating a tailwind for net interest income within our securities portfolio we expect approximately billion in repayments and maturities by the end of although some of this may be partially offset by reinvestments in the portfolio we expect to redeploy that liquidity at substantially higher rates altogether we expect these portfolio trends to benefit our earnings trajectory credit quality remained strong as highlighted on slide net chargeoffs of basis points declined from the fourth quarter which were already below our normal range elevated interest rates continued to pressure customer profitability and debt service ratios which drove migration in general middle market and senior housing our senior housing exposure is limited by design and with a geographically diverse new construction orientation recourse and potential for favorable macroeconomic and demographic tailwinds we feel the risk is very manageable total portfolio normalization trends resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses to of total loans nonperforming assets also increased but still remained well below historical averages overall our trends remained in line with expectations and while we continue to monitor the portfolio very closely we believe ongoing migration will remain manageable comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 on slide first quarter noninterest income of million included a million noncash loss related to the bsby loan hedges not yet to be designated this compared to a million bsby impact in the fourth quarter and since we have now fully redesignated the remaining impacted swaps we do not expect additional markto market volatility related to bsby cessation fiduciary income was impacted by accrual adjustments in trust and accounting changes associated with our ameriprise transition initial feedback on ameriprise has been positive and we continue to think this partnership can drive meaningful revenue growth over time first quarter capital markets income was seasonally light as higher syndication fees were offset by declines in interest rate and energy derivative products we had a million miscellaneous item in the first quarter related to a vendor contract but we would not expect that benefit to repeat expenses on slide included an estimated million additional special fdic assessment incremental to the million charge taken in the fourth quarter excluding this assessment and deferred compensation expenses performed in line with expectations for the quarter generally we saw a seasonal declines across most expense categories with lower severance and temporary labor offset partially by stock compensation further we saw the benefit of lower pension expense which will be consistent throughout the year expense recalibration actions announced last quarter are underway and we expect the majority of identified colleague separations and banking center closures to occur in the second quarter we remain keenly focused on ongoing expense management to support investments and enhance overall earnings slide highlights our conservative capital position as our estimated cet1 grew to although we are below billion in assets our estimated cet1 adjusting for the aoci optout was already above the required regulatory minimums and buffers despite higher unrealized aoci losses due to the rate movement tangible common equity increased to we expect unrealized losses to burn down over time as securities repay and swaps mature but the rate curve continued to create nearterm volatility as i mentioned on our last earnings call we favor a conservative approach to capital management and plan to monitor ongoing aoci movement and regulations as they evolve our outlook for is on slide we project full year average loans to decline largely due to optimization efforts in despite soft first quarter demand and the higher rate curve we still see constructive signs in customer sentiment and pipeline supporting our projected to pointtopoint growth with average loans expected to be flat to down in the second quarter we still anticipate broadbased growth in the second half of the year full year average deposits are expected to be down to from or down to pointtopoint this assumes our new lower level of brokered time deposits remains flat from march and represents an improved average customer deposit outlook for the year excluding brokered time deposits we expect yearend deposits to exceed yearend our yearoveryear net interest income outlook down remains unchanged despite movement in the rate curve strong deposit performance as well as moderating deposit betas largely offset the reduction in the number of rate cuts as a point of clarity we used the april forward curve to reflect the most recently published cpi number and market consensus reflecting two rate cuts in the second half of the year comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 as i mentioned at a conference last month movement in the rate curve since does push our projected net interest income trough into the second quarter but as you can see in our guide we do not expect the quarter overquarter decline to be significant credit quality remained strong and we expect continued migration to be manageable we forecast full year net chargeoffs to move into the lower half of our normal basis point to basis point range we expect noninterest income to grow to on a reported basis which would be down yearto year when adjusting for bsby and ameriprise as detailed on slide with the higher forward curve risk management income is expected to remain strong and we project growth in most customer related fee income categories in the second quarter and throughout the year full year noninterest expenses are expected to decline on a reported basis but grow after adjusting for special fdic assessments expense recalibration and ameriprise as always this assumes deferred compensation of for the remaining quarters projected second quarter expenses should come down from the first quarter due in part to seasonal compensation and we expect to see the benefit of savings related to our recalibration efforts throughout the year continued strategic investment remains a priority and the bar for regulatory compliance and risk management framework continues to rise so we are working to offset and selffund these increasing pressures we saw a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter but excluding discrete items were projecting tax rate for the full year even with projected loan trends we expect to maintain capital well in excess of our target we will continue to monitor aoci volatility and the evolving regulatory environment as we continue to take a conservative approach to share repurchases overall favorable deposit trends put us on the great path to start the year and we feel very good about the earnings trajectory of our business now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim we understand the heightened industry focus on the timing of rate cuts and what that means for quarterly net interest income and we think we have a compelling earnings trajectory however as we think about the true value in our business we think its important to take a step back and reinforce our differentiated value proposition as shown on slide as a leading bank for business with strong wealth management and retail capabilities our tenured colleague deliver valueadded expertise to our enviable customer base our highly regarded approach to credit coupled with our commitment to diversification mitigates risk of loss and has historically outperformed peers customer feedback reinforces our belief that we are the right size to deliver a tailored products while adding value to their business and providing a high level of service product investment and strategic partnerships such as ameriprise that we entered into last year are designed to further enhance our core set of solutions the resilience of our operational deposit base was highlighted this quarter as we outperform normal seasonal patterns and maintain a favorable deposit mix we remain committed to managing the company for the longterm which means taking targeted expense actions like those announced last quarter while still prioritizing investments in our future with our strong capital base proven approach to credit and commitment to risk management we see positive momentum for reasonable growth and enhanced profitability comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 i appreciate your time this morning and now wed be happy to take some questions question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions todays first question is coming from ken usdin of jefferies please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc audio gap about improving profitability and the implied improvement in nii throughout the year just wondering i want to make sure that after this dip in the second quarter then it seems like we could see quite a sharp increase in the second half nii just can you help us understand like what that cadence looks like so if its down a little bit is it up and even more up to exit or because the implied sequential feels like it could be like 570ish kind of getting towards the end of the year and i just want to make sure we understand like how that looks as these deposit pricing and ph last kind of things move through thanks james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc all right good morning ken its jim im happy to answer that question yeah number one we do see an increasing rate of improvement quartertoquarter as we go through the year from second to third and third to fourth and frankly i expect that trend to continue even beyond the fourth quarter of this year and we do have a lot of momentum behind us if i look at some of the big drivers that are driving that momentum probably at the top of the list would be the maturing swaps and securities and we do try to outline what that benefit could be on slide showing those various maturities and they do pick up momentum as we move through the year and into next year so id probably list that as one of the biggest drivers but i would also say loan volume is going to almost be an equally large driver if you look at the guide that we gave it implies a pretty significant hockey stick up in the last couple of quarters of the year and so were certainly pick up some income there probably on a lesser basis obviously well get some more days in the second half of the year and then the liability sensitivity which will not be as large but will be a factor will start to kick in in the second half of the year or two so it will be a nice smooth trajectory upward and we do feel really good about that momentum ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great okay and as a followup just on the deposit side you mentioned that you think deposits will end higher at the end of the year i think the mix is still important how do you expect that dda to total deposit mix to go i mean granted its all good in a the absolute range if its still all moving up but just can you help us understand the mix thanks comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah happy to do that and just to reclarify that will be excluding brokered deposits time brokered deposits since obviously we dont consider those customer related those are down quite a bit even since the end of so that guidance was excluding those but putting that aside we do expect the mix to stay somewhat consistent right now well continue to monitor it and as you know a little bit higher for longer environment but its been holding up very good todate and as we look out into the future we do expect it to continue to hold up to the extent it dips below which were not projecting at this time its more likely to be due to the success with interest bearing deposits as opposed to any challenge with noninterestbearing so we think our yeah mix will continue to be peer leading and a real competitive advantage for us ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks ken operator thank you the next question is coming from john pancari of evercore isi please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning also on the nii expectation i know you indicated that the curve has essentially pushed the nii trough into the second quarter but you also mentioned some of the dynamics of an improving trajectory can you maybe give us some color if we do not get a forward curve and we do not get cuts at all in what does that mean for your nii not only the timing of the trough but the broader outlook and then can you just remind us what fed cut assumption do you have currently in your expectation james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah i mean right now on the expectations we follow the forward curve that came out right after the cpi reports so were sticking pretty closely to that which reflects just under two cuts in the second half of the year if we dont get those cuts i did mention a liability sensitivity and thats a very slight sensitivity position were very close to interest neutral so i would not want to overplay that i think if we dont get the cuts because we are so close to interest neutral its not so much the sensitivity that causes the challenge but i think what causes the challenge for the whole industry is with flat rates you still have the potential for depositors to ask for higher pay rates so i do think probably all banks will see slight increases in pay rates if over the course of the year and into next year if rates werent going to change i do expect that to comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 be a slight impact but those would be the two factors we lose a tiny bit of liability sensitivity which is more of a minor factor for this year but you also run the risk of continued rising pay rates as we move through the year also john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great that helps thank you and then separately on the loan growth side i know you revised your average loan growth guide to down i mean you cited some muted demand but improving pipeline and the expectation of a back half pickup in growth can you maybe talk about the confidence in that pickup where do you see loan generation strengthening what anecdotal data supports that expectation because clearly were seeing industry pressure at this point peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc hey john this is peter so yeah when you say down thats the average yearoveryear and our outlook now is or pointtopoint for and i would say as we did in the comments here its pretty broad based weve got some give and takes as we go throughout the year across our portfolio i think in general though middle market is kind of where we feel probably the best about that we did a lot of rationalization in coming into that i think is sort of affected us for the first quarter and will a little bit in the second but were pretty much past that rationalization and i think from here on we feel good about being able to project the to pointtopoint and again id say its pretty broadbased across really all of our businesses that you see in the deck that we show there are kind of some that i would say are probably more impacted by the interest rates higher for longer than others but i would say that thats mostly kind of in our small business business banking maybe private banking space but in general middle market and up i think it seems like were seeing really really good opportunities and again the pipeline has grown and really feel like thats going to be an opportunity throughout the year john pancari q analyst evercore isi thanks and did you comment on your utilization rate for the quarter peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc i believe its in our deck but its down just a little bit on utilization across the portfolio john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 john pancari q analyst evercore isi thank you peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yes curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks john operator thank you the next question is coming from scott siefers of piper sandler please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thank you guys good morning thank you for taking the questions so jim was hoping and a lot of good detail on slide regarding the swaps and the securities thatll be become a pretty meaningful tailwind as we go forward are you able to sort of help size just the way you sort of think about things internally just order of magnitude of how much nii could improve over the course of the next couple of years and some of your peers have given sort of a longer out margin outlook just anything youre comfortable giving i think theres sort of a wide range of expectations for what earnings could look like at comerica over the next couple of years so just anything that helps sort of narrow the cone a little would be great james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah happy to do that scott its going to depend somewhat on how we redeploy that liquidity so there is going to be a range of outcomes there but we do pick up increasing momentum as we move through this year thatll continue into next year next year we are going to be pretty far north of million of net benefit netting out the maturing securities and swaps versus what we might reinvested in and that benefit next year will also increase positive momentum upward as we move through and so the exit rate for going into will also be very substantial so there is a pretty incredible tailwind coming our direction as it relates to some of these maturities r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then maybe if you could speak in a bit more detail around thoughts on the capital management youve been very appropriately conservative i think the rate moves in the first quarter in particular kind of validated that but just curious if theres a point where you just get more comfortable in resuming comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 repurchase in spite of kind of the volatility in the rate backdrop just given what we know will be coming due and sort of going away over the next couple of years james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah that is something we continue to monitor very closely obviously the first as weve said many times before the first use of capital for us is for our customers and as you heard from peter we are expecting pretty significant loan growth in the second half of the year so we want to make sure were there to support the customers and certainly were going to be in very good shape from that standpoint in terms of turning on the share repurchase i think were going to be in really strong shape from a capital ratio standpoint even with that loan growth but we continue to look at the interest rate environment and the aoci and the new endgame rules whenever they should happen to come out we want to make sure were comfortable from that standpoint and we have seen the interest rate environment kind of shift on us in recent months and the momentum seems to be a little more upward than backwards downwards so that gives us some pause in terms of turning on the share repurchase and we would like to see some stability in interest rates and the overall curve before we turn the share repurchase back on so that continues to be the number one factor that were looking at r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you very much curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks scott operator thank you our next question is coming from steve alexopoulos of jpmorgan chase please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone good morning so last quarter when the forward curve i think had six cuts in it jim you talked about nim dipping down to bit in then a steady climb i think you said by the end of we could get to a nim that was above the level which was to it sounds now that the nim will likely bottom i think youre saying in do you think you could still get up to that level by the end of the year james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc hey good morning steve yeah i do we never give a precise nim percentage for the reasons ive talked about in the past but i will clarify even though we see the dollars of net interest income troughing in the second quarter i do think nim percentage has troughed in the first quarter that we just saw and thats because the balance sheet comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 will continue to shrink a little bit as we on average have repaid some debt maturities and seeing cash come down and again thats one of the reasons i never offer a precise percentage on nim percentage steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc because the two of them have two different answers but we do see nim percentage continuing to rise up as we move through the year i think well be closer to that to quite frankly in the second quarter if you exclude the bsby impact youll see that were going to have a million bsby negative impact in the second quarter compared to the positive million we saw in the first quarter youll see that in the bsby amortization slide but excluding that we do expect to be approaching the in the second quarter and at this point i would expect to be near or slightly above by the end of the year so we are on a very positive trajectory as it relates to both net interest income dollars and nim percentage steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yes that is helpful its interesting the key to all of this seems to be this hockey stick youre talking about of loan growth coming back in the back half of the year its interesting that you look like current gdp is fairly strong your markets in particular its fairly strong you have a general middle market balances still declining and i feel like weve been down this road before not only with comerica with the industry where pipelines improve but then we dont see it translate into actual loan growth what gives you that confidence like what is going to change with that economic picture right now versus the second half where you will suddenly see so much more commercial loan growth in the second half peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc steve its peter i mean i guess that i would say prior to the banking crisis we were seeing pretty good loan growth across all of our portfolio particularly in middle market youre right our geographies i mean i think the diversity of our portfolio continues to show really really well and in middle market in our geographies were having really good results believe it or not in michigan in texas california is probably the most challenged but a lot of our national businesses are not necessarily geographic specific and so i think that sort of broadbased regular growth is what we would expect to see across a lot of our businesses and weve got different levers that we can pull on how much we want to do in one business at any one time and i think we feel really good about the overall trajectory in the second half of the year so youre right i mean the first quarter came in a little lower than we maybe had expected but i think what were seeing in the pipeline growth and our customer sentiment continues to improve quarteroverquarter and so thats what gives us the confidence that we expect to see that in the second half of the year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it and peter do we need to see the fed cutting rates to get this loan growth story moving like if we dont get rate cut this year do you are you guys still confident well see that improvement in the second half comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thats a really good question i would say that the last days thats probably a little bit of our factor in sort of going from to to i would say a little bit in some markets that interest rate issue is bigger than others and in some businesses as i said a little while ago i think you see that in business banking i think you see that in small business i would say california middle market is a little more interest rate sensitive it seems like than our other markets but when you look at kind of our broader specialty businesses i dont know that the interest rate outlook is per se a headwind or tailwind really for that space so again i think the diversity of the portfolio gives us some good tailwinds into whatever kind of interest rate environment were going to see but i guess i would say the smaller in more consumeroriented businesses smaller businesses probably have a little bit of an interest rate headwind to them but thats not a large large percentage of our book overall steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it great thanks for taking my questions peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yes operator thank you the next question is coming from bernard vongizycki of deutsche bank please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning bernard bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys good morning so you introduced the expense recalibration last quarter and i just want to get an update on the optimization of the real estate footprint and head count reductions i think head count declined about versus last quarter and you noted the remaining will get done in  so how do we think about that million cost savings being realized throughout the year james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc good morning bernard its jim we still feel very good about that million were very much on track to what we had expected relative to head count we did recognize some of that change in head count in the first quarter some colleagues have been notified but actually hadnt moved off the payroll yet so we havent seen all that head count reduction yet but we have seen a piece of it there is a much smaller portion of that head count that has been redeployed into other open positions but we were expected to fill those positions anyway and so we will continue to see some attrition of talent just as we continue to implement the savings ideas but virtually all colleagues have been notified at this point and were very much on track comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 i had mentioned in the last call that we do plan on reinvesting many of that savings and some of that investment a fair amount of it will be in risk management profile and the risk framework and some of that will entail hiring colleagues in that space so you wont necessarily see the same drop on a net basis that we talked about on a gross basis in the last call but i would just summarize it to say that we are very much on track with that million that weve talked about bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then just youve highlighted the nice progress obviously on reducing that fhlb advances and brokered deposits how should we think about the opportunity to further reduce wholesale funding throughout the rest of the year james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc well weve at this point weve done a large portion of what we plan to do we dont have any nearterm fhlb maturities we finished a lot of that up this quarter and so we dont necessarily want to prepay that and incur the penalty so i think were where were going to be in large part of that fhlb borrowings for right now we do have a lot of brokered deposits most of our brokered deposits on the books do mature this year and we will let some of those roll off the books permanently and some of those we will roll over so it depends on the shape of the balance sheet at that point we do have a senior debt issuance that matures later this summer and depending on the state of the capital markets weve been love to go out and term out more of our funding so thats going to depend on market receptiveness and overall credit spreads but youre not going to see as significant of a change in summary in the remaining nine months as what youve seen in recent months and what you saw in the first quarter bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay got it thanks for taking my questions james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you operator thank you the next question is coming from manan gosalia of morgan stanley please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 hey good morning so i wanted to ask on deposit i can see that theyre tracking relatively flat across the commercial bank but i think rate expectations move more meaningfully in the back half of the quarter and again more recently after the quarter ended is there much of a headwind from commercial clients maybe taking a look like taking another look at their nib balances in the higher for longer rate environment maybe if you can talk about what do you hearing from them is that something they could do or do you think thats pretty much that move from nib to ib is pretty much done at this stage peter sefzik a chief banking officer senior executive vice president comerica inc manan its a good question this is peter i would say overall we believe that that move from in nib to ib is over but i think youd probably still have some moving parts to jims point if interest rates stay higher for longer that conversation probably continues throughout the year but i dont think its at the pace that what we saw the last months so what we continue to hear is that our customers are really confident in comerica theyre really happy with what were providing them products and services for their liquidity and we feel like the rates that were putting out are very competitive so overall the feedback that were getting from our managers and our customers is i would tell you it feels like the answer to that is yes that we think its over but i think particularly in our larger businesses thats going to be a regular dialogue throughout the year as we kind of see what the interest rate outlook is i would remind you though when you look at the you talk about the commercial bank deposits weve got a very healthy retail bank deposit base very healthy wealth management deposit base both of which have really performed really well lately and so i think that when you look at the balance sheet for us again the diversity of our deposit base is terribly powerful on a go forward basis so theres a lot of levers that we can move when it comes to interest rates and how we go out and attract deposits manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah appreciate that yeah that didnt go unnoticed maybe just shifting over to credit the npls and criticized assets both increased qonq i mean i know you mentioned that the migration should be manageable but how much of this is just a normalization in the level of npas and criticized assets versus the impact of higher for longer rates on your borrowers and also if you can throw any more light on what youre seeing in specific industries melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc sure this is melinda thanks manan appreciate the question yeah i would characterize credit overall as being in really good shape and i know the term normalization has been used a lot over the last couple of quarters but i would characterize our movement as definitely in that normalization phase all of our metrics still are meaningfully below kind of our longterm average particularly the nonperforming assets are less than half of what our normal range would be so those are very very well controlled the increase in the criticized category this quarter came almost exclusively from a portion of our large corporate portfolio in the services senior housing space and so weve been watching this portfolio for a couple of quarters as jim mentioned in his comments we tend to focus on a newer construction type projects these are progressive living type facilities that are very very appealing to an aging population but they have elements thats comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 more real estate oriented so very sensitive to high interest rates but its also an operating business in the healthcare space so theyve had a lot of labor challenges coming out of covid theyve also had a lot of challenges just in getting back to a occupancy level that would allow them to get to stabilization impacted again by some of the inflationary pressures so we this quarter over the last couple of quarters weve been diving deep into this portfolio we did a portfolio review and felt like we took a very appropriately conservative posture around risk rating weve been in the business for years weve got very experienced colleagues on the line credit and our special assets team that is monitoring this portfolio we have one nonperforming asset we have very strong customers and the majority of the portfolio has recourse so i think the i feel pretty good about what the outcome here is going to be although headwinds will continue to be a higherforlonger rate environment theres a lot of tailwinds for this space including an aging population the demographic that this portfolio serves would tend to be a little bit more affluent because it is all private pay so again the senior housing portfolio was the biggest mover in the quarter everything else is actually performing quite well i would call commercial real estate very stable and in fact if you look in the slides theres some positive trends in commercial real estate leveraged portfolio is very stable automotive is stable and tls always has elevated criticized and losses there have been very manageable so i think well continue to see some moderate level of migration but our reserve levels are very appropriate for where we are in the cycle manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great very helpful thank you melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc welcome curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks manan operator thank you the next question is coming from mike mayo of wells fargo please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you mike melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc hi curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning i heard your credit is strong or really good shape you had lower chargeoffs quarterover quarter criticized loans are below historical loan loss reserves are flat and you also added on slide youve had no big net chargeoffs in commercial real estate since so its been a decade since anything major but im just trying to reconcile kind of a good environment today based on your comments with the headwinds from external factors possibly in the future so specifically multifamily whats that about half of your total commercial real estate in california and texas and i think some of the issues out there and correct me if im wrong but falling rental rates higher interest rates higher cap rates and impending loan maturities so the question is under what scenarios would comerica feel the need to build reserves on multifamily or other cre thanks melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc mike this is melinda thanks for the question so lets talk just a little bit about our multifamily portfolio youre right we do have a large portfolio there weve been in this business for many many decades it is a product category that we specifically leaned into post great recession because of its general resiliency our underwriting criteria is very conservative in this space we are a loantocost lenders so the amount of equity that goes into these projects generally a to we are having very successful exits when loans are ready to either mature or properties are sold appraisals although they are down from what we underwrote are still well within guidelines in fact below guidelines because of the amount of equity that we have on the front end so we are seeing a little bit of softness in rent growth we underwrite to sensitize rent so theres a tremendous amount of leeway within the project so we have as you said we have no criticized assets weve had no chargeoffs we have zero delinquencies where its appropriate for exits that the borrower has decided to either sell the property or move it into longterm financing there is still that opportunity plenty of equity in the projects to make that happen so i feel very very confident the majority of this portfolio the vast majority is floating rate so its already absorbed kind of current rates i mean if rates were to continue to go up if we had an upward trajectory there would be a little bit more downward pressure but i dont see a scenario honestly where we have losses in this portfolio just given who we do business with how we underwrite and where we stand from a collateral perspective mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats helpful so when you say the appraisals are down from when you underwrote them how much are the appraisals down and what would be kind of a trigger point that would cause some concern melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc appraisals the recent appraisals call it in the last days or so are down anywhere from to which again most of our loantovalues are sub60 so were still well within reasonable guidelines from a loanto value perspective so were just not seeing were not seeing massive deterioration of value in the multifamily space there are some headwinds for multifamily obviously theres a lot of supply coming on line but theres also tailwinds i mean where our projects are tend to be in areas where employment and population growth is comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 strong that would be texas particularly and again because of the conservative underwriting even with rent growth declining and some amount of small amount of concessions needed to get these projects to stabilization we just dont see any credit deterioration mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and one last pushback again you have the track record youve been in the business decades youve had a decade of great performance but when you said theres no scenarios where youd have serious losses there is that a little bit do you want to be a little bit more conservative with that statement because that seems pretty strong i mean thats a highlevel conviction for sure melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc so i think if if i think about what if we go into a massive recession is it possible yes i think were pretty confident that the economy is on a reasonably good footing and the outlook for a soft landing is certainly what the consensus is so even if rates went up call it basis points or basis points i think this portfolio would still perform so yeah im pretty confident that were in really good footing now with all that said we do have reserves on this portfolio and we continue to build the reserve on our commercial loan commercial real estate book just in case thats why the reserves are there and so again even if we did have some losses were well reserved mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks mike operator thank you the next question is coming from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so good morning good morning jim i want to go back to the securities comments and you have a couple comments in the deck when do we think the security book troughs on a dollar basis i know youre starting to reinvest a little bit but just conceptually the mix of the balance sheet over the next couple of years bonds cash loans loan to deposit how do we think about this the ultimate trough of the bond book james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc good morning chris yeah right now we still are carrying a little higher level securities than we typically would we do think were going to get to the point somewhat of a trough probably lets call it in the first quarter of next comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 year give or take where we will start to reinvest in our mbs portfolio as we imply in the slides we are doing some very minor amounts of treasury reinvestments starting around now but those are relatively small amounts in the past if you look at our securities as a percentage of the balance sheet its going to vary and it should vary based on the composition of the balance sheet and deposit levels and the types of deposits we have but in the past weve carried securities on the balance sheet anywhere from midtohigh teens of total assets i would see that probably going up a couple percentage points going forward just because were hearing and putting ourselves relatively against higher liquidity runoffs just to be that much more conservative given what we saw with the regional bank crisis last year and the higher regulatory bar and so we probably wont carry relative to history a little higher percentage than we have in the past but were still not there quite yet but i suspect we will be by the first quarter or so of next year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats helpful and then maybe one quick modeling you mentioned that the discrete tax benefit what was the dollar amount of that in the quarter james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc on a net basis it was million christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you chris operator thank you the next question is coming from zach westerlind of ubs please go ahead zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc hi curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning zach zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc my question is good morning my question is just on the nii guide i think a key piece of that was on around the beta assumptions so i was wondering if you could provide any color on that and kind of like what are your assumptions around the down beta compared to the upcycle beta thanks comerica inc cma corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2024 james j herzog a chief financial officer senior executive vice president comerica inc yeah good morning zach yeah we actually are assuming in the guide that we stick pretty close to that sensitivity ph alternate sensitivity that we provided on the asset sensitivity slide which is and were at a cumulative beta of course right now so we would expect initially to go down something close to the current cumulative beta of we would expect probably up to a one month lag likely relative to fed cuts but i will emphasize that every cycle is a little bit different in terms of how quickly the industry is allowed to cut and i continue to say that it depends on frankly the reason for the fed cuts if its a very orderly take down and its a very soft landing you might see a little bit more delay in those cuts and if its due to some concern in the economy makes it a lot easier to enforce some of those cuts so its going to really depend on how the overall landscape of the economy lays out and the reason for those cuts but we feel pretty confident that we can get some significant reductions from those customers that most recently pushed the beta up and i continue to say that were on a little bit of a lifo basis last in first out some of the bigger increases that weve seen came in the last few months from a beta standpoint and those will probably be the easiest ones to push back down since they were closer to that beta level so anyway the short answer to your question is we are assuming a beta on the way down with about a onemonth lag zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc understood thanks very much curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you zach operator thank you at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to curt farmer president chairman and chief executive officer for closing comments curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer
