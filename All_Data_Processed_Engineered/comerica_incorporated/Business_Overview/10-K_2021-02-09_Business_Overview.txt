business segments finance is also reported as a segment comerica operates in three primary geographic markets texas california and michigan as well as in arizona and florida with select businesses operating in several other states and in canada and mexico we provide information about the net interest income and noninterest income we received from our various classes of products and services under the caption analysis of net interest income on page f5 of the financial section of this report under the caption ratevolume analysis on page f6 of the financial section of this report and under the caption noninterest income on pages f7 through f8 of the financial section of this report competition the financial services business is highly competitive comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their three primary geographic markets of texas california and michigan as well as in the states of arizona and florida they also compete in broader national geographic markets as well as markets in mexico and canada they are subject to competition with respect to various products and services including without limitation commercial loans and lines of credit deposits cash management capital market products international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management services loan syndication services consumer lending consumer deposit gathering mortgage loan origination consumer products fiduciary services private banking retirement services investment management and advisory services investment banking services brokerage services the sale of annuity products and the sale of life disability and longterm care insurance products comerica competes largely on the basis of industry expertise the range of products and services offered pricing and reputation customer convenience quality customer service and responsiveness to customer needs and the overall relationship with our clients our competitors are large national and regional financial institutions as well as smaller financial institutions some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas market area may make available to their customers a broader array of product pricing and structure alternatives and due to their asset size may more easily absorb credit losses in a larger overall portfolio some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and processes increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer further comericas banking competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered they may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to increase in the future in addition to banks comericas banking subsidiaries also face competition from other financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer and commercial finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures in addition the industry continues to consolidate which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions while potentially strengthening the franchises of acquirers supervision and regulation banks bank holding companies and financial institutions are highly regulated at both the state and federal level comerica is subject to supervision and regulation at the federal level by the board of governors of the

has been some recalibration of the postfinancial crisis framework however comericas business remains subject to extensive regulation and supervision further it is too soon for comerica to predict what

categories defined by the frb each weighted differently based on the level of credit risk that is ascribed to such assets or commitments based on counterparty type and asset class a depository institutions or holding companys capital is divided into three tiers common equity tier cet1 additional tier and tier cet1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders equity less certain deductions for goodwill intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards if any additional tier capital primarily includes any outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus comerica has also made the election to permanently exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to debt and equity securities classified as availableforsale cash flow hedges and defined benefit postretirement plans from cet1 capital tier capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for credit losses on september the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provides banking organizations that implement the current expected credit loss cecl standard during the calendar year

substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bank holding companys particular condition risk profile and growth plans failure to be well capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators including restrictions on comericas or its bank

improvement act fdicia requires among other things the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet certain minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized an institution that fails to remain well capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution as of december each of comericas bank subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded those required for an institution to be considered well capitalized under these regulations as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapitalbased safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality various risk and management exposures eg credit operational market interest rate etc and executive compensation the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards fdicia also contains a variety of other provisions that may affect the operations of depository institutions including reporting requirements regulatory standards for real estate lending truth in savings provisions the requirement that a depository institution give days prior notice to customers and regulatory authorities before closing any branch and a prohibition on the acceptance or renewal of brokered deposits by depository institutions that are not well capitalized or are adequately capitalized and have not received a waiver from the fdic dividends comerica incorporated is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries since comericas consolidated net income and liquidity consists largely of net income of and dividends received from comericas bank subsidiaries comericas ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares depends upon its receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries there are statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the payment of dividends by subsidiary banks to comerica as well as by comerica to its shareholders certain but not all of these requirements are discussed below no assurances can be given that comericas bank subsidiaries will in any circumstances pay dividends to comerica comerica bank and comerica bank trust national association are required by federal law to obtain the prior approval of the frb andor the occ as the case may be for the declaration and payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the board of directors of such bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of i such banks net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for that year plus ii the retained net income as defined and interpreted by regulation for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january comericas subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately million from retained net profits of the preceding two years comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of million in billion in and billion in comerica and its bank subsidiaries must maintain a cet1 capital conservation buffer of to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions including dividends furthermore federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a bank or bank holding company from paying dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the fdicia prompt corrective action regime discussed above which applies to each of comerica bank and comerica bank trust national association a bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming undercapitalized in addition comerica bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to comerica and requires prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels frb supervisory guidance generally provides that a bank holding company should not pay dividends unless the bank holding companys net income over the last four quarters net of dividends paid is sufficient to fully fund the dividends the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and the bank holding company will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios the supervisory guidance also provides that a bank holding company should inform the frb reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding companys capital structure bank holding companies also are required to consult with the frb before redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments including common stock or materially increasing dividends transactions with affiliates federal banking laws and regulations impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions between a bank and its affiliates including between comerica and its nonbank subsidiaries on the one hand and comericas affiliate insured depository institutions on the other for example section of the federal reserve act limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions loans and other covered transactions with any particular nonbank affiliate including financial subsidiaries to no more than of the institutions total capital and limits the aggregate outstanding amount of any insured depository institutions covered transactions with all of its nonbank affiliates to no more than of its total capital covered transactions are defined by statute to include i a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate ii a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate iii a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate iv the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan v the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate and vi securities borrowing or lending transactions and derivative transactions with an affiliate to the extent that either causes a bank or its affiliate to have credit exposure to the securities borrowinglending or derivative counterparty section of the federal reserve act also generally requires that an insured depository institutions loans to its nonbank affiliates be at a minimum secured and section of the federal reserve act generally requires that an insured depository institutions transactions with its nonbank affiliates be on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same or at least as favorable as those prevailing for comparable transactions with nonaffiliates federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by fdicinsured banks such as comerica bank and comerica bank trust national association and their subsidiaries to their directors executive officers and principal shareholders data privacy and cybersecurity regulation comerica is subject to many us federal us state and international laws and regulations governing consumer data privacy protection which require among other things maintaining policies and procedures to protect the nonpublic confidential information of customers and employees the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act generally prohibit financial institutions including comerica and its subsidiaries from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes primarily marketing unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure other laws and regulations at the international federal and state levels limit comericas ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact customers with marketing offers the grammleachbliley act also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information because we have a limited presence in new york we are subject to certain requirements of the new york department of financial services cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies which include maintaining a cybersecurity program and policies and breach notification requirements in october the federal banking regulators issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions including comerica and their thirdparty service providers the proposed standards would expand existing cybersecurity regulations and guidance to focus on cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness in addition the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector comerica continues to monitor the development of this rule data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus for example in june of the governor of california signed into law the california consumer privacy act of the ccpa the ccpa which became effective on january applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds the ccpa will give consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions the right to opt out of the sale of the consumers personal information and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights the ccpa contains several exemptions including an exemption applicable to information that is collected processed sold or disclosed pursuant to the grammleachbliley act the california attorney general adopted regulations implementing the ccpa on august comerica has a physical footprint in california and is required to comply with the ccpa in addition similar laws may be adopted by other states where comerica does business the federal government may also pass data privacy or data protection legislation like other lenders comerica bank and other of comericas subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities use of such data is regulated under the fair credit reporting act fcra and the fcra also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus prescreening individuals for credit offers sharing of information between affiliates and using affiliate data for marketing purposes similar state laws may impose additional requirements on comerica and its subsidiaries fdic insurance assessments the dif provides deposit insurance coverage for certain deposits up to per depositor in each deposit account category comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system where the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the dif the assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly and could increase if for example criticized loans andor other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases for comericas fdic insurance expense totaled million antimoney laundering regulations comerica is subject to several federal laws that are designed to combat money laundering terrorist financing and transactions with persons companies or foreign governments designated by us authorities aml laws this category of laws includes the bank secrecy act the money laundering control act and the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of or usa patriot act the aml laws and their implementing regulations require insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies procedures and controls to detect prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing the aml laws and their regulations also provide for information sharing subject to conditions between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions as well as among financial institutions for counterterrorism purposes federal banking regulators are required when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering activities of the applicants to comply with these obligations comerica and its various operating units have implemented appropriate internal practices procedures and controls office of foreign assets control regulation the office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofacadministered sanctions take many different forms for example sanctions may include restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons ofac also publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons blocked assets eg property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences interstate banking and branching the interstate banking and branching efficiency act the interstate act as amended by the doddfrank act permits a bank holding company with frb approval to acquire banking institutions located in states other than the bank holding companys home state without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited under state law but subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bank holding company prior to and following the proposed acquisition control no more than percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the us and no more than percent of such deposits in that state or such amount as established by state law if such amount is lower than percent the interstate act as amended also authorizes banks to operate branch offices outside their home states by merging with outofstate banks purchasing branches in other states and by establishing de novo branches in other states subject to various conditions in the case of purchasing branches in a state in which it does not already have banking operations de novo interstate branching is permissible if under the law of the state in which the branch is to be located a state bank chartered by that state would be permitted to establish the branch a bank holding company or bank must be well capitalized and well managed in order to take advantage of these interstate banking and branching provisions comerica has consolidated the majority of its banking business into one bank comerica bank with banking centers in texas arizona california florida and michigan as well as canada source of strength and crossguarantee requirements federal law and frb regulations require that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength to each subsidiary bank and commit resources to support each subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when a bank holding company may not be able to provide such support without adversely affecting its ability to meet other obligations the frb may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the frb believes might jeopardize the bank holding companys ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank under these requirements comerica may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary banks should they experience financial distress capital loans by comerica to its subsidiary banks would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the subsidiary banks in the event of comericas bankruptcy any commitment by comerica to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of its subsidiary banks would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment similarly under the crossguarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the fdic either as a result of the failure of a banking subsidiary or related to fdic assistance provided to such a subsidiary in danger of failure the other banking subsidiaries may be assessed for the fdics loss subject to certain exceptions an fdic crossguarantee claim against a depository institution is superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against such depository institution supervisory and enforcement powers of federal and state banking agencies the frb and other federal and state banking agencies have broad supervisory and enforcement powers including without limitation and as prescribed to each agency by applicable law the power to conduct examinations and investigations impose nonpublic supervisory agreements issue cease and desist orders terminate deposit insurance impose substantial fines and other civil penalties and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject comerica or its banking subsidiaries as well as officers and directors of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil and criminal penalties bank regulators regularly examine the operations of bank holding companies and banks and the results of these examinations as well as certain supervisory and enforcement actions are confidential and may not be made public resolution plans as a depository institution with billion or more of total consolidated assets comerica bank is required to periodically file a resolution plan with the fdic on april the fdic released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking anpr with respect to the fdics bank resolution plan requirements meant to better tailor bank resolution plans to a firms size complexity and risk profile the anpr offers two alternative approaches to resolution planning for commenters to consider and solicits comment on how to tailor the requirements of the rule to reflect differences in size complexity and other factors among the population of large insured depository institutions and on whether to increase the current threshold of billion in assets that triggers application of the rule incentivebased compensation comerica is subject to guidance issued by the frb occ and fdic intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers senior executives as well as other employees who either individually or as part of a group have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements i should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii should be compatible with effective controls and riskmanagement and iii should be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements they should be promptly addressed enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies similar to other large banking organizations comerica has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the frb the federal reserve bank of dallas and the texas department of banking since as part of that review comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation programs throughout the organization the individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plans design and implementation comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on comerica it is comericas intent to continue monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation practices in the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section of the doddfrank act section directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss this proposal supplements the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule imposes enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation comerica is monitoring the development of this rule the volcker rule comerica is prohibited under the volcker rule from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for its own account and having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds covered funds the volcker rule regulations contain exemptions for marketmaking hedging underwriting and trading in us government and agency obligations and permit certain ownership interests in certain types of covered funds to be retained they also permit the offering and sponsoring of covered funds under certain conditions the volcker rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities comerica has compliance programs required by the volcker rule and has either divested or received extensions for any holdings in covered funds additional information on comericas portfolio of indirect through funds private equity and venture capital investments which includes the covered funds is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements located on page f55 of the financial section of this report in october the five federal agencies with rulemaking authority with respect to the volcker rule finalized changes designed to simplify compliance with the volcker rule the final rule formalized a threetiered approach to compliance program requirements for banking entities based on their level of trading activity as a banking entity with moderate trading assets and liabilities less than billion comerica is subject to simplified compliance requirements in june regulators finalized a rule further modifying the volcker rules prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring covered funds the final rule modifies three areas of the rule by streamlining the covered funds portion of the rule addressing the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds and permitting banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address comerica continues to follow volcker rule developments derivative transactions as a state member bank comerica bank may engage in derivative transactions as permitted by applicable texas and federal law title vii of the doddfrank act contains a comprehensive framework for overthecounter otc derivatives transactions even though many of the requirements
