the financial section of this report under the caption ratevolume analysis in the financial section of this report and under the caption noninterest income in the financial section of this report competition the financial services business is highly competitive comerica and its subsidiaries mainly compete in their primary and secondary geographic markets and also compete throughout the continental us mexico and canada as they pursue certain businesses on a national scale that fall outside of the primary markets such as us banking mortgage banker environmental services and national dealer services they have strategically placed offices in faster growing markets where there is a concentration of customers and industries they serve comerica has established commercial offices in north carolina and south carolina private banking offices in georgia and made investments in the mountain west region of the united states comerica is subject to competition with respect to various products and services including without limitation commercial products such as loans and lines of credit deposits cash management including payments solutions and card services capital markets international trade finance letters of credit foreign exchange management and loan syndications consumer products such as loans deposits and origination of mortgage loans and credit cards and wealth management services such as comprehensive financial planning trust and fiduciary services investment management and advisory brokerage private banking and business transition planning services comerica competes largely on the basis of industry expertise the range of products and services offered pricing and reputation convenience quality of service responsiveness to customer needs and the overall customer relationship comericas competitors include financial institutions of all sizes some of comericas larger competitors including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in comericas markets may have a broader array of products and structure alternatives and due to their size may more easily absorb credit losses some of comericas competitors larger or smaller may have more liberal lending policies and aggressive pricing standards for loans deposits and services increasingly comerica competes with other companies based on financial technology and capabilities such as mobile banking applications and funds transfer further comericas competitors may be subject to significantly different or lesser regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered some competitors may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the cost of regulations in addition to banks comerica and its banking subsidiaries also face competition from financial intermediaries including savings and loan associations consumer and commercial finance companies leasing companies venture capital funds credit unions investment banks insurance companies and securities firms competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase as technology advances have lowered the barriers to entry for financial technology companies with customers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives including crowdfunding digital wallets and money transfer services the ability of nonbanks to provide services previously limited to traditional banks has intensified competition because nonbanks are not subject to many of the same table of contents regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures finally the industry continues to consolidate which eliminates some regional and local institutions while potentially strengthening acquirers comerica believes that the level of competition in all geographic markets will continue to

protection act egrrcpa as described below there was some recalibration of the postfinancial crisis framework however banks bank holding companies and financial institutions businesses remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision the failure of certain banks in the spring of played a role in another increase in bank regulation at least some of which could apply to comerica the community

to as basel iii endgame that would result in significant changes to the us regulatory capital rules under egrrcpa for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of billion or more comericas total consolidated assets are below this billion threshold but comerica continues to invest in potential preparation should it meet that threshold or regulators lower that threshold if comerica becomes subject to these requirements or becomes subject to any other new laws or regulations related to capital and liquidity such requirements could limit comericas ability to pay dividends or make share repurchases or require comerica to reduce business levels or to raise capital which would have a material adverse effect on comericas financial condition and results of operations in addition to

banking agencies to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet certain minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital tiers well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized an institution that fails to remain well capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain noncapitalbased safety and soundness standards for institutions any such agency supervises the standards relate generally to among others earnings liquidity operations and management asset quality

transfers to surplus or to fund the retirement of preferred stock at january comericas subsidiary banks could declare aggregate dividends of approximately million from retained net profits of the preceding two years comericas subsidiary banks declared dividends of million in billion in and million in furthermore federal regulatory agencies can prohibit a bank or bank holding company from paying dividends under circumstances in which such payment could be deemed an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the fdicia prompt corrective action regime discussed above a bank is specifically prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company if payment would result in the bank becoming undercapitalized in addition the bank is also subject to limitations under texas state law regarding the amount of earnings that may be paid out as dividends to comerica and requires prior approval for payments of dividends that exceed certain levels frb supervisory guidance generally provides that a bank holding company should not maintain its existing rate of dividends on common stock unless the organizations net income over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organizations capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition and the organization will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios the supervisory guidance also provides that a bank holding company should inform the frb reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding companys capital structure the guidance suggests that bank holding companies consult with the frb before redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments or materially increasing dividends in addition frb regulation requires bank holding companies to provide notice to

of the disclosure other laws and regulations at the international federal and state levels limit comericas ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact customers with marketing offers the grammleachbliley act also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information federal banking and securities regulations also impose certain requirements on comerica and its subsidiary banks in the event of a cyber or computerrelated security incident in the federal banking regulators issued the interagency rule for computersecurity incident notification

assessments the dif provides deposit insurance coverage for certain deposits up to per depositor in each deposit account category comericas subsidiary banks are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system where the assessment rates for an insured depository institution are determined by an assessment rate calculator which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each institution poses to the dif the assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity under the current system premiums are table of contents assessed quarterly and could increase if for example criticized loans andor other higher risk assets increase or balance sheet liquidity decreases or a banks supervisory ratings worsen for comericas fdic insurance expense totaled million on october the fdic finalized a rule that would increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of the fdic as required under the federal deposit insurance act established a plan in september to restore the dif reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of percent within eight years this plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate based on the fdics recent projections however the fdic determined that the dif reserve ratio is at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of september without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rates the increased assessment would improve the likelihood that the dif reserve ratio would reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline consistent with the fdics amended restoration plan the rule became effective as of january as a result of bank failures during early regulators invoked a systemic risk exception in an effort to strengthen public confidence in the banking system and protect depositors as required by law the fdic announced that any losses to the dif to support uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banking organizations on november the fdic adopted a final rule to

company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bank holding company fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the frb believes might jeopardize the bank holding companys ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank under these requirements comerica may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary banks should they experience financial distress capital loans by comerica to its subsidiary banks would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the subsidiary banks in the event of comericas bankruptcy any commitment by comerica to a federal bank regulatory agency

complexity and risk profile in connection with this rulemaking the fdic placed a moratorium on resolution plans until the rulemaking process was complete on june the fdic lifted the moratorium on resolution plan submissions for institutions with billion or more in total assets under the fdics statement on resolution plans for idis an institution will be required to submit resolution plans when it has billion or more in total assets as determined based upon the average of the institutions four most recent reports of condition and income on august the fdic released a proposed rule that would require insured depository institutions with assets of at least billion but less than billion such as the bank to submit resolutionrelated informational filings comerica is monitoring the development of this proposal incentivebased compensation comerica is subject to guidance issued by the frb occ and fdic intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers senior executives as well as other employees who either individually or as part of a group have the ability to expose the banking organization to material amounts of risk is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements i should provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii should be compatible with effective controls and riskmanagement and iii should be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors banking organizations are expected to review regularly their incentive compensation arrangements based on these three principles where there are deficiencies in the incentive compensation arrangements they should be promptly addressed enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness particularly if the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies similar to other large banking organizations comerica has been subject to a continuing review of incentive compensation policies and practices by representatives of the frb the federal reserve bank of dallas and the texas department of banking since as part of that review comerica has undertaken a thorough analysis of all the incentive compensation programs throughout the organization the individuals covered by each plan and the risks inherent in each plans design and implementation comerica has determined that risks arising from employee compensation plans are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on comerica it is comericas intent to continue monitoring regulations and best practices for sound incentive compensation practices in the frb occ and several other federal financial regulators revised and reproposed rules to implement section of the doddfrank act section directed regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements or any feature of any such arrangement at covered financial institutions that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss this proposal would supplement the final guidance issued by the banking agencies in june consistent with the doddfrank act the proposed rule would impose heightened standards for institutions with billion or more in total consolidated assets which includes comerica for these larger institutions the proposed rule would require the deferral of at least percent of incentivebased payments for designated executives and significant risktakers who individually have the ability to expose the institution to possible losses that are substantial in relation to the institutions size capital or overall risk tolerance moreover incentivebased compensation of these individuals would be subject to potential clawback for seven years following vesting further the rule would impose enhanced risk management controls and governance and internal policy and procedure requirements with respect to incentive compensation comerica is monitoring the development of this proposal the volcker rule comerica is prohibited under the volcker rule from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for its own account and having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds covered funds the volcker rule regulations contain exemptions for marketmaking hedging underwriting and trading in us government and agency obligations and permit certain ownership interests in certain types of covered funds to be retained they also permit the offering and sponsoring of covered funds under certain conditions the volcker rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities comerica has compliance programs required by the volcker rule and has either divested or received extensions for any holdings in covered funds table of contents in october the five federal agencies with rulemaking authority with respect to the volcker rule finalized changes designed to simplify compliance with the volcker rule the final rule formalized a threetiered approach to compliance program requirements for banking entities based on their level of trading activity as a banking entity with moderate trading assets and liabilities less than billion comerica is subject to simplified compliance requirements in june regulators finalized a rule further modifying the volcker rules prohibition on banking entities investing in or sponsoring covered funds the final rule modifies three areas of the rule by streamlining the covered funds portion of the rule addressing the extraterritorial treatment of certain foreign funds and permitting banking entities to offer financial services and engage in other activities that do not raise concerns that the volcker rule was intended to address comerica continues to follow volcker rule developments derivative transactions as a state member bank the bank may engage in derivative transactions as permitted by applicable texas and federal law title vii of the doddfrank act contains a comprehensive framework for overthecounter otc derivatives transactions even though many of the requirements do not impact comerica directly since the bank does not meet the definition of swap dealer or major swap participant comerica continues to review and evaluate the extent to which such requirements impact its business indirectly on november the cftc issued a final rule that sets the permanent aggregate gross notional amount threshold for the de minimis exception from the definition of swap dealer at billion in swap dealing activity entered into by a person over the preceding months comericas swap dealing activities for purposes of the de minimis exception are currently below this threshold the initial margin requirements for noncentrally cleared swaps and securitybased swaps were effective for comericas swap and securitybased swap counterparties that are swap dealers or major swap participants on september and such counterparties are required to collect initial margin from comerica the initial margin requirements were issued for the purpose of ensuring safety and soundness of swap trading in light of the risk to the financial system associated with noncleared swaps activity consumer
