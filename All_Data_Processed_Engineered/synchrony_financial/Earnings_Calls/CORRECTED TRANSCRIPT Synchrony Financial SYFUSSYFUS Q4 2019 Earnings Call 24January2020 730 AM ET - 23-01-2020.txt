call 24jan2020 loan receivables were down however on a core basis which excludes walmart and the yamaha portfolio that we moved to loans held for sale in the fourth quarter loan receivables were up on a core basis the loan receivable growth drove growth in interest and fees purchase volume was up and average active accounts increased the efficiency ratio was including a restructuring charge of million for employee costs which had a basis point impact on the efficiency ratio this quarter as we continue to drive cost efficiency for the company we grew deposits billion or over last year and much of this growth has come through direct deposits which grew our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source for our growth and we continue to invest in our bank to help attract new deposits and retain existing customers while organic growth continues to present the largest opportunity for us and we have demonstrated our ability to not only grow our existing programs but also

corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 i will take a moment to highlight our platform results on slide in retail card loans were down but increased on a core basis with solid growth driven by our digital partners other metrics were down driven by the sale of the walmart portfolio we are excited about our new partnership with verizon in addition to the other partnerships we announced in and look forward to launching these new programs this year payment solutions delivered a strong quarter with broadbased growth across the sales platform and particular strength in home furnishings and home specialty that resulted in loan receivable growth of or on a core basis interest and fees on loans increased primarily driven by the loan receivables growth purchase volume was up and average active accounts increased we signed a number of new programs and renewed key partnerships this quarter we continued to drive growth organically through our partnerships and card networks these networks along with other initiatives such as driving higher card reuse which now stands at approximately of purchase volume excluding oil and gas have helped to drive solid results and position the payment solutions platform for future growth carecredit also delivered another strong quarter receivables growth of was led by our dental and veterinary specialties interest and fees on loans increased primarily driven by the loan receivables growth purchase volume was up and average active accounts increased we continue to expand our network and the utility of our card most recently through our partnership with kaiser permanente which helped to drive the reuse rate to of purchase volume in the fourth quarter throughout the year we drove strong growth across our sales platforms we extended and expanded relationships signed exciting new partnerships launched new programs increased the utility of our cards and networks and grew our payment solutions platform to over billion and our carecredit network to over billion in receivables our efforts and achievements provide a strong foundation for the future with that ill turn the call over to brian wenzel to review our financial performance for the quarter and year and our outlook for brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks margaret and good morning everyone ill start on slide of the presentation this morning we reported fourth quarter earnings of million or per diluted share this include the remaining reduction in the reserve related to the sale of the walmart consumer portfolio in october as margaret noted earlier the reduction totaled million or million aftertax and provided an eps benefit of to the quarter we generated solid yearoveryear growth in several areas as noted on slide excluding walmart and the yamaha portfolio which was moved to loans held for sale in the fourth quarter loan receivables were up on a core basis interest and fees on loan receivables were also up on a core basis over last year driven by the growth in receivables on a core basis purchase volume growth was and average active accounts increased over last year overall were pleased with the underlying growth we generated across the business as well as the riskadjusted returns on this growth synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 rsas increased million or from last year improved program performance and growth primarily drove the increase the increase also included the rsa impact resulting from the million release of reserves due to the reclassification of loan receivables to held for sale for yamaha rsas as a percent of average receivables was for the quarter the rsa percent was impacted by the sale of the walmart portfolio which operated at an rsa percent below the company average in addition to the factors driving the increase in rsas the provision for loan losses decreased million or from last year the reduction was mainly driven by the lower core reserve build and a reduction in net chargeoffs the core reserve build for the fourth quarter was million other income increased million over last year mainly due to lower loyalty cost as a result of the walmart program conversion other expenses were basically flat to last year but included a restructuring charge of million included in employee costs so overall the company continued to generate solid results in the fourth quarter ill move to slide to cover our net interest income and margin trends net interest income decreased from last year primarily driven by a decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables due to the sale of the walmart portfolio on a core basis interest and fees on loan receivables increased the net interest margin was compared to last years margin of the main factors driving the margin performance were a decline in loan receivables mix as a percent of total earning assets the mix declined from to driven by holding excess liquidity of approximately billion resulting from the proceeds of the sale of the walmart portfolio a basis point decrease in the loan receivables yield to primarily driven by the sale of the walmart portfolio and a basis point increase in total interestbearing liabilities cost to primarily due to the higher benchmark rates later in the call ill provide more insight on the direction of the net interest margin for including the impact from the sale of the walmart portfolio next ill cover our key credit trends on slide in terms of specific dynamics in the quarter ill start with our delinquency trends the 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year and the 90plus delinquency rate was compared to last year if you exclude the impact of the paypal credit program and the walmart portfolio the 30plus delinquency rate and the 90plus delinquency rate were flat compared to last year reflecting continued stable credit trends focusing on net chargeoff trends the net chargeoff rate was compared to last year the reduction in the net chargeoff rate was primarily driven by walmart and improving credit trends this was partially offset by the purchase accounting impact in related to the paypal credit program excluding the impact of the paypal credit program and the walmart portfolio the net chargeoff rate was approximately basis points lower than last year the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loan receivables was the core reserve build in the fourth quarter was million excluding the impact of the final reduction in the reserve related to the walmart portfolio which was million and a release of the reserves of million for the yamaha portfolio which was reclassified to held for sale in the fourth quarter the yamaha release had no impact on net earnings due to the rsa offset i discussed earlier synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 in summary the core credit trends have leveled off and are slightly better than our expectations we expect the core trends to show stability as we move forward assuming stable economic conditions we continue to see good opportunities for growth at attractive riskadjusted returns later ill provide an outlook on credit expectations for the year including the impact of adopting cecl moving to slide ill cover our expenses for the quarter overall expenses came in at billion basically flat compared to last year this includes a restructuring charge of million included in employee costs in the fourth quarter while we did see an increase in expenses driven by growth this was offset by cost reductions from walmart we achieved our cost reductions goal for walmart and those cost reductions will be in the expense run rate for the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter increased to the increase was primarily driven by walmart which operated at a lower efficiency ratio than the company average higher rsas including the impact from the yamaha portfolio and also included the restructuring charge moving to slide over the last year weve grown our deposits billion or this puts deposits at of our funding compared to last year while we slowed overall deposit growth in the second half of in anticipation of the proceeds from the walmart sale we did continue to grow lower cost direct deposits at a strong pace in the fourth quarter focusing on capital and liquidity we ended the quarter at cet1 under the fully phasedin basel iii rules a slight increase over last year in november we completed our first preferred stock issuance totaling million at a fixed rate of the issuance had strong demand and was significantly oversubscribed during the quarter we continued to execute on our capital plan we announced in may we paid a common stock dividend of per share and repurchased billion or million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter at the end of the fourth quarter we have approximately billion of remaining share repurchase capacity of the billion board authorized plan which runs through june total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion which equated to of our total assets this is up from last year reflecting the approximate billion of excess liquidity were holding from the proceeds from the sale of the walmart portfolio overall we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously were committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases next on slide ill recap our performance compared to the outlook we provided last january starting with loan receivables our core growth of was in line with our outlook range of to organic growth remained the primary driver of the solid results strong value props on our cards effective marketing strategies continued investments in technology digital assets and data analytic capabilities are enhancing our ability to drive organic growth as well as win new programs we continue to see strong growth of to in our payment solutions and carecredit sales platforms net interest margin was for the year in line with the to range we expected we did see the margin impact resulting from the sale of the walmart portfolio in the fourth quarter and the impact will continue into which i will cover in our outlook synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 rsas as a percent of average receivables came in higher than our outlook last january rsas were for the year compared to our outlook of to the higher rsa percent was mainly driven by improved program and credit performance in and included the rsa impact resulting from the release of reserves related to yamaha our net chargeoff rate of was below our to outlook range for the year credit trends moderately improved in slightly better than our expectations the sale of the walmart portfolio also had a positive impact on the net chargeoff rate in the fourth quarter and that will continue into the efficiency ratio for the year was slightly above our expectations this was mainly due to higher rsas that resulted from improved program and credit performance during and also included the restructuring charge we recognized during the fourth quarter finally excluding the impact of the reductions in the walmart reserve we generated a return on assets of versus our expectations of approximately on slide ill recap the estimated impact of adopting cecl the adoption of cecl was effective on january 1st so no impact on the initial adjustment is recorded to retain earnings and does not impact net earnings or eps the initial impact on the allowance for loan losses from the adoption of cecl on january 1st was an increase of approximately billion or of the yearend balance in line with our expectations the reduction to retained earnings from the aftertax impact is approximately billion as well as creating a deferred tax asset of approximately million on a regulatory basis we elected to phase in the approximate billion impact on capital at per year in each year from to on a cet1 transition basis this will impact the ratio by approximately basis points per year during the phase in period we want to continue to emphasize our view that cecl is an accounting versus an economic change cecl does not affect the cash flows generated by the company how we view the lifetime value of an account or the irr of marketing investments we are providing the outlook which includes the anticipated impact of cecl and have highlighted those specific measures where we expect to see the impact from cecl to provide comparability on how our expectations align with beginning with the first quarter we expect to provide similar visibility to help with the comparison to the prior year where the historical loss method was utilized moving on to our outlook on slide our macro assumptions for includes stable key benchmark and unemployment rates throughout the year our outlook for receivable growth is in the to range as margaret noted we have new programs such as venmo and verizon that well be launching throughout the year as a result we expect receivables growth to accelerate in the second half of the year we expect the purchase volume will run at our historical rate of to times broader retail sales and for online and mobile to continue its strong growth synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 we believe our net interest margin will run in the to range for the year lower than where margin has run historically and with normal seasonality we see quartertoquarter one factor driving lower margin expectation is the excess liquidity of approximately billion that we will be carrying on our balance sheet from the proceeds of the walmart sale we expect the excess liquidity will be deployed through growth as the year progresses however it will impact our margin by an estimated basis points in the other factor is the impact of not having the higher yields the walmart portfolio contributed regarding the net interest margin performance throughout the year we expect it to run closer to in the first half of the year then trend back closer to the during the second half of the year as we deploy the excess liquidity we expect that rsas as a percent of average receivables will be in the to range for the single largest driver of the expected increase in the rsa outlook is the sale of the walmart portfolio which operated at a lower rsa percent than our overall rate the outlook is more in line with our historical run rate and reflects continued strong performance of our programs while there will be no rsa offset on the initial cecl adjustment to reserves the ongoing impact of cecl will be included in the rsa which will provide a partial offset to the reserve increase that offset is muted in the first half of and then more fully realized in the second half of the year in accordance with the calculations of the rsa and our program agreements in terms of credit we expect the net chargeoff rate for will be in the to range versus the in the sale of the walmart portfolio has a positive impact on the net chargeoff rate regarding loan loss reserve builds we expect the total reserve build for the year under cecl will be in the million to million range versus million to million if we continue reserving under the same methodology as this represents approximately a million increase in reserve provisioning due to the implementation of cecl there are factors that can impact these ranges such as changes in economic trends consumer behavior portfolio and product mix and the underlying assumptions used in determining the allowance for loan losses we expect to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of approximately in line with also impacting the efficiency ratio will be the technology and people investments necessary to launch the new programs we have noted these are upfront investments we must make to broaden our capabilities and build the infrastructure around the programs ahead of the actual launch the total estimated impact on eps from launching these programs is approximately of eps dilution which includes investments ahead of the launch operating costs and reserves related to the growth of these new programs while starting up these programs has a dilutive effect on eps in were excited about the future potential they provide the preferred stock dividends will start this year and will be paid quarterly beginning in midfebruary the dividends for the full year will amount to million or a reduction in eps finally consistent with our track record excluding the impact of cecl we expect to generate a return on assets of approximately in which includes the dilution related to launching the new programs synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 as part of this outlook i want to provide a view on certain key earnings drivers for the first quarter we expect the net interest margin to remain near in the first quarter due to the factors i noted previously typically we see the net chargeoff rate trend seasonally higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter due to the seasonal decline in receivables the increase has historically been in the range of basis points and we expect the trend in the first quarter to be similar we expect that rsas as a percent of average receivables will be in the to range with and without cecl impact regarding reserve builds we expect the build to be million to million with cecl and million to million excluding the impact of cecl we expect the efficiency ratio to be approximately for the first quarter then the ratio to trend down as the year progresses with that ill turn it over to brian doubles to highlight the strategies that will help drive future results brian d doubles president synchrony financial thanks brian ill close with a recap of our strategic priorities which are focused on driving longterm value creation while diversifying for the future a top priority as always is the growth of our core partnerships opportunities to grow will continue to be evaluated through the lens of the riskadjusted returns they produce to strengthen our relationships we will seek to continue to deliver innovative new products and capabilities that add value to cardholders and the programs and drive card usage and brand loyalty we will also continue to launch new programs where we believe the partnership can deliver the opportunity for growth at attractive risk adjusted returns we will also seek to diversify through targeted strategies in payment solutions carecredit and our synchrony branded products this will help us to achieve a more diverse revenue base through the acceleration of growth in small programs and new products we will focus on growing payment solutions through enhanced pointofsale capabilities and innovative product offerings in carecredit we will continue to work on broader acceptance and further expansion of the network with an emphasis on health systems like our recently announced partnership with kaiser permanente this is an area where we see a significant opportunity we will also continue to invest in our synchronybranded products the auto and home networks and the synchrony mastercard lastly we will leverage our recent acquisitions to develop and grow new revenue sources in egifting and pets technology and data analytics remain a key focus as we strive to provide bestinclass customer experiences we believe this customerfirst approach will be an increasingly important growth driver we will continue the expansion of advanced data analytics leveraging customerlevel performance dynamics and further develop capabilities to deliver frictionless customer experiences were also focused on alternative data and machine learning to further drive innovation advanced underwriting and authentication these investments are critical to driving growth in our existing programs as well as securing renewals and winning new programs like venmo and verizon synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 it remains a key priority to operate our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile we have proven our ability to do this and it will remain a top priority for us in the future we expect to maintain strong capital and liquidity to support our operations business growth credit ratings and regulatory targets finally we will continue to utilize our strong capital position to support growth launch new programs invest in products and capabilities and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we believe we are well positioned for longterm growth and we look forward to driving results for our partners cardholders and shareholders in and beyond i will now turn it over to greg to begin the qa portion of our call greg wade ketron senior vice president managing director of investor relations synchrony financial that concludes our comments on the quarter we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one followup question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning ryan brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so i wanted to start off with a question on the net interest margin so it had been running in the call it to range since you went public and deployed all your liquidity now just to think about the moving pieces youre saying for the first quarter which means you need to be 155plus for the rest of the year to reach the middle of the guide synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 so i know its hard to forecast very far out given all the moving pieces but should we think about 1550plus as a more normal margin range once we get beyond this liquidity impact and then second are there any other levers particularly on the funding side you could have to drive this back closer to that historical range thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks ryan so yes were trending towards the in the front half of the year really as we work through the billion of excess liquidity we have from walmart coming off the fourth quarter we obviously are trying to work the funding profile and manage that to deploy that liquidity as fast as possible including through organic growth really in the first couple of quarters of as we guided the back half of the year should trend towards that so when you think about it yearover year theres really the two major impacts right the first one is burning off this excess liquidity the second is the impact of the walmart portfolio which operated at a higher margin than the company average and other portfolios so obviously walmart was out for a part of the fourth quarter so when you add those events we should trend back towards that in the back part of the year ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay got it and maybe just to squeeze in a question on costs so i thought i heard you say that you achieved all of the walmart cost savings in the run rate i just wanted to double check if that was the case and can you maybe just help us understand the moving pieces on the expense growth going forward i know brian doubles talked about some of them but margaret maybe you could expand on what are some of the big strategic investments that youre making and would you view this as a year of accelerating cost growth and we could potentially get back to something lower beyond this year thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so ill handle the first part and then give it over to margaret so as you think about the cost again were guiding to approximately which is just basis points higher than the full year average of yes we did get the cost reductions that we anticipated for walmart out and theyll be fully baked into the run rate as we move forward the impact slightly on the efficiency ratio again is walmartrelated because of the high revenue that came off with that portfolio and what it generated it ran at a much lower efficiency ratio as a portfolio than the company average so thats the slight tick up that youll see there margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah and i think ryan on investments its really a couple of things so first is really the investment were making in venmo and verizon both of these programs are going to really be fully digitized inapp experiences and so weve added a number of agile teams to really develop a number of apis to really deliver for those partners we have ph the launch fund we have people that we need to add so those are really a big part of the strategic initiative in terms of those two programs more broadly were continuing to invest in a couple of key areas we talked a little bit about carecredit were adding resources and technology enhancements there particularly as we go into health systems which we believe is a really great investment and one where well get a great return over time synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 and just broadly i would say from a technology perspective we continue on this journey of really driving digitization and frictionless customer experiences id say the other area were very focused on is really what i would call the customer journey so i think weve done a really good job on the front end meaning how you apply and buy and using your mobile capabilities but were really looking at how do we get more efficiency out of our back office in terms of using digitization to really excel that experience for the customer so it is a bit of investment i think the biggest kind of add to the year is really though the verizon and venmo investment were making and in our mind those are two great opportunities for us for future growth and we think that that investment is really going to be the right investment to make for the company ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and thanks for all the color on cecl brian d doubles a president synchrony financial thanks ryan operator thank you our next question comes from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe a q orenbuch analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great i was hoping that and i kind of hate to ask a question like this kind of precise but you did billion of net interest income in the fourth quarter and usually you have a little bit of a seasonal decline in  and then start growing given that you do expect the margin to be higher and assets to grow and walmart was almost entirely out of  is it reasonable that other than normal seasonal impacts that we should expect to see growth in nii from the  level brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks moshe yes as you think about the fourth quarter walmart was in for approximately call it days so that impact when you think about the quarter there will be a slight dilution as it relates to that and then really its the excess liquidity that were carrying thats impacting along with normal seasonality ph when you think sequentially quarteroverquarter moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc right but that excess liquidity isnt impacting dollars of net interest income in a material way right brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah its also impact yes it is impacting on dollars synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc okay second question just on the expenses you talked about the charge and then that was in the  and then some investments maybe just because you did say that youre going to have an improvement over time kind of back on the efficiency side maybe just can you talk a little bit about the approach that youre taking to those investments how you would see them paying back over what period of time and how we should think about that brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so if you think about the investments margaret highlighted it so you think about the investments in verizon and venmo theres different pieces of it right we have to prestage people right so we have teams been up and standing up here to get these programs ready well have certain launch costs as you think about research thats done on the consumer the value proposition et cetera that phases in as margaret talked about were then standing up the it and infrastructure these are sizable opportunities and we need to be at fullscale relative to the launches both verizon in the first half and venmo in the second half and given the nature of these two opportunities there are specific things around data lake around how were doing digital servicing as margaret talked about api so that cost builds up right as we move through the year so that piece is the incremental we run with hopefully a very good cost discipline in the business we got the cost reduction we wanted from walmart were continuing to try to drive out and drive efficiencies in the business and the processes whether it sits in the enterprise operations side or across all our core functions and we look at the business from multiple different lenses and how we manage expenses and well be fairly disciplined as we move through moshe a orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks so much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you operator thank you our next question is from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning and appreciate all the cecl commentary thank you so when we think about the loan growth expectations that we have in and the growth that we saw this year correct me if im wrong but it seems like the core portfolio is growing mid singledigits which is lower than what we have seen in the past can you guys talk about sort of how that will migrate over time because you do have a set of more highergrowth merchants now in the portfolio and then maybe how yeah i guess how it would migrate higher over the next several years would be the question there synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks sanjay so as you think about growth were projecting to this year were coming off of last year if you think about from the to range our average growth was to ex the paypal acquisition so were growing in line with that again verizon and venmo will come in theyll phase in again theyre de novo programs with one launch in the first half one launch in the second half were not providing longterm guidance relative to the growth rate but obviously they are startup programs and that trajectory well obviously provide guidance as we move into so were inside historical norms if you look inside the portfolio there are moving pieces yes we have some fastgrowing portfolios but we also have some pockets that are not growing as fast that im sure you can recognize and they work in concert so again were comfortable with the to range we have this year its within guidance and then clearly well look at the trajectory of the new programs that were launching this year sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i guess two sort of data pointrelated followups the preferred stock issuance what drove that was it just diversifying funding sources and then the chargeoff rate the relative chargeoff rate to this years guidance if we were to take out walmart in do we have the metric around that like what that chargeoff rate would have been thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah with regard to your first question we have talked longterm about our capital strategy and really moving our capital levels cet1 et cetera in line with peers along this journey we started out with an cet1 were down to now part of that longterm capital strategy has been diversification to match our peers so it was always part of the strategy it was included in our capital plan that we filed with the regulators and was approved by our board earlier this year so it was part of our diversification efforts really to lower the overall cost of equity so it was important for us to get it done the timing of which the market was very attractive we got our rate for the preferred a significant amount of institutional and retail investors so it was significantly oversubscribed we obviously wanted access to the market and wanted to do it before and any potential disruptions that may come to the market from unforeseen events so thats really the rationale behind why we did it and your second question was on just remind me sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah the chargeoff rate like do we have the equivalent of that chargeoff rate ex walmart for brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah were not going to provide it sanjay ex walmart but what id say is this is we gave you an indication probably months ago about what that rate was whats happened since then obviously the portfolio has synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 deteriorated from billion to the roughly billion that we sold it at as well as the fact that the credit refinements that we put in place several years ago really helped to start reducing that so the impact this year was not as significant right as what wed indicated months ago sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you brian j wenzel a sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you operator our next question is from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning can you talk a little bit more about the interplay of cecl and the rsa i mean just on the surface the increase in provision seems like a pretty sizable amount but i guess theres an offset can you just talk more about that i know you touched on it earlier brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks don yeah so as you think about the rsa obviously weve been talking to our partners for several months about the change and how it impacts the rsas i just want to be clear we are passing for those rsas that participate in reserves the rsa the full amount of cecl will be reflected in the rsa we did not amend any of our agreements to either exclude or reduce the amount of reserve provisioning that those agreements associated with so i just want to be clear on that as you think about cecl and the impact to the rsa i think it needs to be important to ground things the primary platform that uses rsas is the retail card platform that platform actually has a lower provisioning relative to cecl given its products and how it interacts the payment solutions and carecredit business given the longer duration promotional activity that happens there actually attracts a larger cecl increase as you move through also impacting that theres a slight lag that happens the way with which the calculations work as it passes through so again youll see that in the full run rate in the year particularly in the back half of the year as we move forward donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you and then just quickly on underwriting are you making any changes to your underwriting right now or are you sort of in a steady state are you seeing any competitors loosen up just given the sort of better economic outlook margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 yeah we have not loosened up what i would say is weve been pretty consistent in our underwriting obviously were always making slight changes i think one of the things weve talked about in the past is weve done a lot of investing in how were creating our models and the data that were using both externally and internally and so i think were much more strategic in how we look at underwriting and thats really helped us i think continue to see the good performance were seeing in delinquencies and chargeoffs so were being pretty consistent i think this is the time where you want to just continue to be very consistent and thoughtful as you think about where we are in the cycle donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks don operator thank you we have our next question from ryan cary with bank of america ryan cary q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning guys margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning ryan cary q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i think most of the discussion around loan growth acceleration in is resulting from the new program launches like venmo and verizon but could there be any benefit from paypal as the conversion is now behind you and has there been discussion about moving out to more of an integration phase or is this more likely to benefit is longer more likely to take a little bit longer term to ramp margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial no i think look i think paypal is a fastgrowing portfolio for us its performing the way we thought it would perform i think what we talked about last year was getting the portfolio converted which happened in june it was a fairly big and sophisticated conversion what were really focused on now with the paypal team is really looking at how we accelerate growth i think venmos a little different in the sense that its a startup so it will take us a little longer to get that growth going but id say overall were pretty pleased about the growth that were seeing its the kind of growth we want to see and i think as we add some of these new more digitallydriven partners that will continue to play into our portfolio synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 i do want to make one point that despite maybe some of the retailers struggling a little more one of the things i think were definitely winning on is on the mobile side and were definitely seeing growth in mobile and i think as we went through holiday that was a big part of our win i think with our partners and our partners are continuing to depend on us to really deliver capability to them to really drive growth digitally so i think thats something that were going to continue to focus on as well brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah let me just add one point of clarity as you think about the primary amount of the growth for the year when you think about the to is coming off the existing book so while were launching verizon and venmo given the timing of it during first half and second half when youre thinking about that growth on end of period its not going to be a big movement this year its something as we think about in future years thats going to be an accelerator so just to make sure were clear that the existing portfolio is driving that growth ryan cary q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay okay and just wanted to ask one on the gpr card i think youd said there are number of direct mailings in the quarter im just curious about the resulting adoption and uptake and how that compared to your expectations do you expect to accelerate direct marketing on the gpr card for next year brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah so look we continue to see really good trends on the card id say theyre generally better than our expectations on both of the campaigns that weve done were seeing good activation good usage nice retention of the balances but as i said last quarter were being very disciplined around profitability and returns so and then short term weve got modest growth expectations were being very thoughtful look we realize its a very competitive market and were trying to target profitable accounts so we really we like this space we like what were seeing so far but were going to be disciplined on how we approach this ryan cary q analyst bank of america merrill lynch great thank you brian j wenzel a sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you operator we have our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i wanted to dig in a little bit on the rsa and just make sure i understand i know you gave the range for the full year to but then you talked about how beginning of the year it will be lower and synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 end of the year will be higher is that within the range that youre identifying or is this range the average for the full year and the quarterlies could be beyond the range thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the to is the average for the full year betsy so again weve given you some projections in the first half the real moving piece here obviously is the cecl impact which is a little bit more muted the way the contractual calculations work that then normalizes in the back half of the year but the to is the full year estimate betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so we could see the quarterlies be either side of that or within youre not really telling us right i just want to make sure brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah again its going to average out to to it could be at the lower end or it could be the higher end obviously its going to vary relative to the program performance and the credit performance of the portfolio so it could vary but again i think betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial across the full year it will get back betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay brian j wenzel a sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial to the range betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then separately just on verizon interesting new partner maybe margaret you could speak a little bit to the set of services and products that youre going to be offering them that was attractive to them as to why they picked you and then could you speak a little bit more to what kind of market opportunity you think is out there given what verizon represents synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so first were going to be doing their cobrand card it will be branded verizon were working very closely with them to really make sure this is a stateoftheart digitallydriven card were pretty excited about some of the things were working on were not going to communicate the value prop and things like that because thats going to happen when we do the launch look they have about retail phone connections so this is a pretty big opportunity for us and were excited about the partnership theyre highly engaged id say we won the deal because of some of the investments weve been making i think we turned the corner on the question mark in my mind of are we digitally savvy and i think based on the winners that we the programs we won this year i think were winning because of these investments that weve made and the investments that were going to continue to make so very excited about verizon betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc million customers thats what youre talking about margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial no like phone connections its actually phone lines betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial its how they calculate it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thanks brian d doubles a president synchrony financial thanks betsy operator thank you our next question is from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my questions this morning margaret and brian you both referenced the data analytics and machine learning that youre investing in and also commented that youve already started to strategically apply those insights i am curious what youre seeing right now in terms of consumer behavior synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 theres a lot of talk about bifurcation amongst consumers and given the breadth of your portfolio i am wondering what you guys are seeing and how you are applying that strategically margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial im not sure what you mean by bifurcation meaning good customers and bad customers from a credit perspective or richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc well no more economically that theres such a divergence in the economy and im curious if you are seeing greater or lesser opportunity particularly in the middle and lower income brackets margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial no i dont think we our underwriting standards are based on the consumers capability to pay for the credit card so thats core to how we underwrite i think the things that were looking to further enhance is leveraging data from our partners for instance id say more in how we set a credit line upfront so if the partner shares with us that this particular consumer shops very heavily we might give a higher credit line than we normally would based on that data i think one of the important aspects of our business different than maybe the general purpose credit card space is you can apply and buy right away so weve got to be very disciplined from a line size perspective when we give an initial line and thats where i think were really learning and really driving some good customer experience because were sharing the data between us and the partner i think the other area is helping us on fraud and true name and using identity and things like that that are really helping us so for instance weve leveraged payfone as an example where now on our mobile app you only have to fill out three lines and thats really helping us do a better job at identifying that customer and again a lot of this has to do with because were an applyandbuy company we have to be very diligent in identifying that if the right customer thats applying brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah rick maybe one thing just to add to that i think its what weve seen so far is now that our partners are sharing things like spend levels number of visits to the store average basket size payment behavior those metrics which result in what we call an engagement index really cuts across income levels and so were finding that to be a very powerful predictor in terms of how those accounts are going to perform how theyre going to behave from a spend perspective but also a loss perspective and fraud as well so its benefiting us in a number of different areas richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great okay that detail is very helpful thank you guys very much brian d doubles a president synchrony financial thanks rick synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 operator and we have our next question from bill carcache with nomura william carcache q analyst nomura instinet thanks good morning margaret and brian doubles i wanted to ask you a question about whether you could give us a sense of your interest level in synchronys exposure to potentially merchant receivables and essentially making loans to merchants backed by their sales is there any potential growth opportunity there that you see for synchrony is it something you havent given much thought to but would consider any color you can give us on that would be great margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah thats not a space that were i would say we are considering i think we have laid out our strategy as being focused on i think were going to stick to the things we really know and grow that way i dont if you brian d doubles a president synchrony financial no yeah i mean look were a consumer lender thats what were good at were going to stick to our knitting there and we see a ton of great growth opportunities in our existing business which we outlined so i think never say never but its not on the strategic map right now i think weve got a ton of great growth opportunity in all three of our platforms we like what were seeing in the directtoconsumer space so were going full throttle in those areas and well revisit at some point in the future but right now a lot of growth opportunity in the core william carcache q analyst nomura instinet understood and so then perhaps sticking with the consumer is there any interest level and perhaps taking a look at international consumer at some point or again is the growth opportunity enough in the us that you see thats probably not something that you would consider nearterm again any color you can give on that would be helpful as well brian d doubles a president synchrony financial yeah bill look its something weve considered weve talked about it the leadership team and with the board again i think we see enough opportunity right now in our current market and in the us that we dont feel the need to go international but never say never the business does work in certain markets overseas weve seen that well continue to assess it but nothing in the short term william carcache q analyst nomura instinet understood thank you for taking my questions brian d doubles a president synchrony financial sure synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2020 margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial thank you greg wade ketron a senior vice president managing director of investor relations synchrony financial vanessa we have time for one more question operator thank you sir our final question comes from john hecht with jefferies john your line is open john hecht q analyst jefferies llc sorry guys thanks for taking my questions i guess final question here is maybe talk about the pipeline of different opportunities and then i guess from a broad perspective it seems like the more recent partner wins have been more technologically based with verizon paypal venmo and so forth and is there any changing dynamics with who youre going after and is there any changing dynamics with respect to the competitive environment margaret m keane a chief executive officer director synchrony financial yes ill start with the second part i think the competitive environment is pretty has been pretty consistent i dont think anyones doing anything too crazy out there so i think we feel pretty good about where were placed in the competitive environment i think look we still want to win core retail deals so this and if you look at our payment solutions business a lot of what we won was the core of that business i think these opportunities have come along or have been i think somewhat unique in terms of them coming to the marketplace theres just not a lot of big retail deals that are out there right now in terms of existing portfolios we can we continue to see a number of smaller midsized deals that we have in our pipeline i would say all three platforms have a pretty good pipeline of opportunity and were very focused on that so i think youll see us down the road youll see more retail deals its not like were walking away from that space i just think this is what was in the market and opportunity for us to in some cases differentiate our portfolio a little bit john hecht q analyst jefferies llc great thanks very much greg wade ketron senior vice president managing director of investor relations synchrony financial okay thanks everyone for joining us this morning the investor relations team
