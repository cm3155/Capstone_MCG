synchrony financial thanks kathryn and good morning everyone synchrony continued to execute on our key strategic priorities and deliver strong financial results for the second quarter including net earnings of million or per diluted share a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of these results were driven by synchronys differentiated business model and our deep understanding of the needs and expectations of our customers and partners consumer health also remained strong during the second quarter which supported continued demand for the wide variety of products and services that our partners merchants and providers offer as a result synchrony added million new accounts grew average active accounts by and achieved our highest purchase volume ever in a quarter of billion a yearoveryear increase of and or a increase on a core basis dual and cobranded cards accounted for of core purchase volume and increased from the prior year consumer spend was broadbased across our platforms leading to double digit growth in our diversified value health wellness digital and home auto platforms as well as single digit growth in our lifestyle platform synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 we also continue to see higher engagement across our portfolio as purchase volume per account grew by compared to last year the continued strength in purchase volume contributed to loan receivables growth of yearoveryear or on a core basis our dual and cobranded cards accounted for of core receivables and increased from the prior year we also continue to extend our reach and engage more customers thanks to our ability to deliver our seamless experiences attractive value propositions and broad suite of flexible financing options across our evergrowing network of distribution channels to that end we recently announced the launch of synchrony setpay pay in through fiservs clover pointofsale and business management platform this buy now pay later offering further expands the suite of payment and financing options and will be part of the pay with synchrony app on the clover app market for merchants through our partnership synchrony is able to expand our customer reach and distribution through hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the country synchronys longterm partnership with adventhealth one of the largest notforprofit healthcare providers in the us is another example of how we continue to expand and deepen our reach in health wellness adventhealth will offer carecredit as its primary patient financing option and will accept carecredit nationwide in more than facilities including hospitals urgent care centers outpatient clinics and physician practices as outofpocket health expenses continue to rise for consumers synchronys carecredit is a way for people to pay for care not covered by insurance including deductibles coinsurance and copays carecredits flexible financing options will be available for all points of care and within the patients adventhealth account which includes epics mychart portal enabling patients to manage their care needs alongside the resulting financial obligations in addition to extending options for consumers to pay for care carecredit will also help streamline the health systems payment processes in short synchrony is increasingly anywhere our customer is looking to make a payment or finance a purchase big or small in person or digitally we can meet them whenever and however they want to be met with a broad range of products and services to meet their needs in any given moment this ability to deliver the versatility of our financial ecosystem seamlessly across channels industries and retailers and providers alike is what positions synchrony so well to sustainably grow particularly as customer needs change and market conditions evolve we have one of the largest active account bases in the us with more than million active accounts and yet our typical customer has less than two of our products on average as we continue to expand our distribution channels and more effectively leverage our various marketplaces and networks synchrony can connect our partners with more customers and drive still greater lifetime value expansion say for example our home auto care networks where combined annual visits surpassed million last year and carecreditcom which received almost million provider views in as well as health systems across the country and our strategic partnerships with pointofsale platforms like clover no matter how you look at it synchrony is increasingly delivering the power of our networks on behalf of both our customers and our partners whether its through the expansion of our existing customer wallet share or increasing our reach to new customers we are driving efficient and sustainable growth because of our increasingly ubiquitous presence and the universal utility of our offering from revolving lines like our private label dual and cobranded cards to our broad range of installment offerings and secured and commercial products synchronys financial ecosystem can deliver the right financing offer for the right product at the right time all while optimizing the value they see and of course this is all enabled by our dynamic technology stack synchrony has prioritized innovation for many years and have the digital capabilities to facilitate deep integrations with sophisticated partners as well as simple synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 functionality for smaller local businesses we can be as plugandplay or as customized as necessary without increasing our level of investment as synchrony leverages our proprietary data analytics and underwriting through these integrations we deliver not only seamless experiences but also consistently powerful outcomes for both our customers and partners the breadth and depth of our consumer lending expertise informs every aspect of our customer and partner strategies and allows us to support them and provide a great experience the level of continuity that synchrony provides across channels spend categories and partners as well as through business and market changes drives both loyalty and resilience for synchrony and our stakeholders from partners with digital omni presence across spend categories and pointofsale and merchants that offer great value across discretionary and nondiscretionary needs to providers like doctors and dentists and major health systems like adventhealth and st lukes and practice management software like epic synchrony is increasingly at the centre of a broad range of financing needs empowering our customers with choice and best inclass value propositions that truly make a difference this drives greater diversity and resilience in our portfolio both in terms of our sales platforms and the industries we serve as well as consumer spend categories our customers finance everyday purchases like gas groceries and routine medical expenses as well as more episodic needs like buying a new mattress or replacing a refrigerator they drive great value from our general purpose and dual and cobrand cards coupled with the bestinclass rewards they can earn on their spend about half of our outofpartner spend is comprised of nondiscretionary spend like bill pay discount store drugstore healthcare grocery and auto and gas and of course synchrony also derives resilience from our disciplined approach to growth at appropriate riskadjusted returns our sophisticated data analytics and our proprietary underwriting have enabled synchrony to reach more customers and offer them greater financial flexibility while also maintaining or improving upon the predicted level of risk in fact since synchrony has more than doubled our purchase volume receivables and interest income while also growing our mix of prime and super prime customers by percentage points meanwhile we built a very strong balance sheet including a stable deposit base that represents more than of our funding at any given time consistent and efficient access to the debt capital markets and a robust capital and liquidity position such that we currently operate with cet1 ratio at tier and credit reserve ratio so when you bring it all together synchrony is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth and resilient riskadjusted returns even as market conditions change and the needs of our customers and our partners evolve we leverage our proprietary data and analytics diversified product suite and dynamic tech stack to maintain low customer acquisition costs deliver consistent credit performance and drive greater customer lifetime value we align our partners interest with our own through retail share arrangements which are designed to deliver consistent riskadjusted returns for synchrony through changing market conditions while also sharing program profitability with our partners and we utilize a stable and efficient funding model to provide continuity to our customers and partners when they need it most and with that ill turn the call over to brian to discuss the second quarter financial performance in greater detail brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone synchrony delivered another strong financial performance for the second quarter highlighting the benefits of our highly diversified business across our sales platforms our synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 partners merchants providers and customers and underpinned by the continued health of the consumer this quarter we achieved the highest quarterly purchase volume as a company exceeding billion which reflected a increase compared to last year on a core basis which excludes the impact of our recently sold portfolios in the prior and current year quarters purchase volume grew yearoveryear from a platform perspective our diversified value health wellness digital and home auto platforms each continue to generate doubledigit yearoveryear growth in purchase volume reflecting strong demand for the variety of goods and services we finance as well as the broad partner merchant and provider networks that connect our customers and partners at the platform level home auto purchase volume was higher due to continued strength in home as well as higher autorelated spend reflecting the waning effects from the pandemic period the preference for consumers to invest in the maintenance of their existing vehicles given the supply chain issues on new and used vehicle sales and the impact of inflationary pressures on gasoline purchases and automotive parts in diversified value purchase volume increased driven by the strong retailer performance and higher customer engagement the yearoveryear increase in digital purchase volume generally reflected the growth across the platform we experienced greater customer engagement including higher average active accounts and spend per active among our more established programs and continued momentum in our new program launches the increase in health wellness purchase volume was driven by broadbased growth in active accounts and higher spend per active account driven by our dental pet and cosmetic categories our lifestyle platform generated purchase volume growth of reflecting strong retailer sales and growth in our music specialty and luxury verticals partially offset by the ongoing impact of inventory shortages in our outdoor vertical and particularly strong growth in the prior year period loan receivables grew yearoveryear to billion or on a core basis we also continue to see sequential growth driven by strong purchase volume and partially offset by higher payment levels net interest income increased to billion primarily reflecting the increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables payment rate for the second quarter when normalizing for the impact of the portfolio sold during  was approximately basis points higher than last year and approximately basis points higher than our historical average the net interest margin was in the second quarter a year overyear increase of basis points the primary driver of our nim expansion was a basis point increase in the mix of loan receivables relative to total interestearning assets primarily due to the growth in average receivables and lower liquidity this accounted for basis points of the yearoveryear increase in our net interest margin in addition the second quarters basis point improvement in loan yield contributed to a basis point improvement in net interest margin while the slight increase in interestbearing liability costs reduced net interest margin by basis point rsas were billion in the second quarter and of average receivables the million yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our partner programs and also included an approximately million impact associated with our reinvestment of the gain on sale from portfolios sold during the second quarter the reinvestment was in support of the growth initiatives in association with the value proposition launch synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 as a reminder the rsa is designed to create mutual alignment of interest while each agreement is unique to the partner program we generally structure the majority of our economic arrangements such that the investment and upside opportunities are shared so as slide demonstrates the rsa enables our partners to share in the profitability of our programs while also providing economic protection to our business in a rising credit loss environment the level of rsa payment to our partner declines because the higher credit costs become a larger offset to the programs profitability in addition the minimum profitability threshold within each rsa ensures that synchrony achieves an appropriate riskadjusted return before any incremental program economics are shared with the partner these minimum return thresholds also provide a buffer to our business in the occasional event of a regulatory change such that the profitability of the program performance is impacted by for example a change in fees collected this dynamic also was demonstrated on slide due to the strength of our riskadjusted return when the card act became effective in given the questions regarding the potential changes to late fee regulation i thought id highlight two things first over of our late fee revenue flows through our rsa agreements and will be subject to sharing with our partners second greater than of the late fees are covered through either repricing rights or change in law provisions effectively change in regulation provisions which were included in our program agreements adopted after the card act was implemented this is another example of how the rsa functioned as alignment of interest with our partners as market conditions change next lets focus on provision for credit losses which was million for the quarter a yearoveryear increase due to the impact of a reserve release last year and partially offset by lower net chargeoffs other income increased million primarily reflecting the impact of the million gain on sale from the portfolio sold during the quarter excluding the impacts of the gain and certain reinvestments of the portion of the proceeds other income would have been lower yearoveryear primarily due to the impact of higher loyalty costs that were partially offset by interchange revenue yearoveryear other expenses increased to billion due to the impact of higher employee costs marketing spend information processing and other expenses our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was compared to last year excluding the effects of the reinvestment expenses deployed from the gain and sale proceeds the efficiency ratio would have been an approximate basis point improvement the increase in employee costs versus last year reflected higher head count driven by growth and insourcing as well as higher hourly wages and other compensation adjustments total other expenses included million of costs related to additional marketing and site strategy actions as we reinvest the million gain on sale through these and other growth and efficiency initiatives as detailed in the appendix of our presentation we expect that the gain on sale and reinvestment in  and the remainder of this year will net out as eps neutral on a full year basis in summary synchrony generated net earnings of million or per diluted share for the second quarter we also generated a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of these strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitallyenabled model combined with the compelling value of the financial products and services we offer through our financial ecosystem not only were we able to support the strong customer demand with a diverse range of products but were able to do so while maintaining cost discipline and strong riskadjusted returns synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 next ill cover our key credit trends on slide at a macro level we continue to see signs of gradual normalization across the credit spectrum of the portfolio that said even with this normalization our and vintages continue to perform better than our vintages and payment rates remain elevated versus last year as well as compared to our historical average with regard to delinquency our 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year and our plus delinquency rate was compared to last year the yearoveryear delinquency comparisons were primarily impacted by the prior year periods historic lows at which point the impacts of covid19 stimulus and forbearance action had the greatest impact on the portfolio our portfolio of strong delinquency trends have continued to drive yearoveryear improvement in our net charge off rate which was compared to last year an basis point improvement yearoveryear primarily reflecting the very strong consumer our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was down basis points from the in the first quarter lets focus on some key trends that continue to support our strong performance and confidence we have in our business first the consumer remains in a strong position the combination of robust labor markets wage growth and elevated savings continues to support the desire to spend and repay their financial obligations while also managing through the impacts of the inflationary pressures according to external data stimulus spending segments have generally remained consistent from march through june about twothirds of consumers have either spent a portion of their stimulus or have the entire amount of stimulus they receive still saved the remaining third of consumers has spent the entirety of the cash stimulus they received during the last two years when taking a look across the balance tiers the top two tiers of the stimulus recipients those with balances above have seen modest balance decreases while the lower tier balances less than have remained flat during the second quarter consumers rotated their spend within discretionary and non discretionary categories as they manage higher costs from inflationary pressures while still fulfilling their everyday purchases in general we saw a slight variability across our out of partner spend volume and frequency trends these fluctuations likely indicate that the consumer is not actively reducing total spend or frequency but rather rotating their overall spend so for example in certain categories like grocery it appears that our customer is managing to ticket size and substituting items that are a greater priority whether that means choosing a generic brand or forgoing a less desired item or ph treat in terms of gas station spend however average transaction values have accelerated with rising gas prices but transaction frequency has generally held constant if not increased slightly all this is to say we continue to see trends of a strong consumer who is moving through their daytoday and spending money without meaningfully changing their choices or priorities second the differentiated strength of our business as well as the underlying trends within our portfolio that we have discussed today continue to demonstrate synchronys ability to deliver consistent riskadjusted returns through changing market conditions in addition to the inherent resilience that comes from the diversification of our portfolio across spend categories financing options distribution channels and customer demographics synchrony derives financial strength through our sophisticated cycletested underwriting the predictive power of our credit decisioning and account management capabilities supports more stable loss performance around our target credit loss range of to even as economic conditions change and consumer creditworthiness evolves synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 from peak loss rate of during the great financial crisis the last decades average of approximately loss level our portfolio has grown and evolved meaningfully and even as the mix of partners and credit quality of our portfolio has shifted over that same decade synchrony has grown significantly and delivered resilient riskadjusted returns within a band of to its also important to note that weve delivered these returns even as interest and fees have been coming at somewhat lower levels due to the elevated ph payment rates during the last two years moving on to another synchrony strength our funding capital and liquidity synchronys balance sheet has been built to be resilient over time we have diversified our business in support of our ability to generate consistent riskadjusted returns and considerable capital this in turn has allowed us to grow and evolve our balance sheet such that we can fund growth efficiently without having to make tradeoffs with regard to whats in the best long term interest of our business and our various stakeholders lets start with the strong and stable foundation of synchronys funding our deposit base deposits at the end of the second quarter reached billion an increase of billion compared to last year our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by billion this resulted in deposits being of our funding compared to last year with both securitized and unsecured funding each comprising of our funding sources at quarter end total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion which equated to of our total assets down from last year as a reminder before i provide the details on our capital position it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the cecl transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies the impact of cecl has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet the annual transitional adjustment pertains strictly to our regulatory capital metrics we ended the quarter at cet1 under the cecl transition rules basis points lower than last years level of the tier capital ratio was of the cecl transition rules compared to last year the total capital ratio decreased basis points to and the tier capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phasedin basis decreased to compared to last year we continue to deliver robust capital returns to our shareholders in the second quarter we returned million to shareholders through million of share repurchases and million of common stock dividends when considering our existing capital position today combined with the meaningful earnings and capital generation of our business synchrony is particularly well positioned to execute our capital plan as guided by our business performance market conditions and subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions as of quarter end our total remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending june sic was billion finally lets review our full year outlook which is summarized on slide of our presentation and incorporates the following macroeconomic assumptions interest rate increases during qualitative tightening measures a slowing economy resulting from these actions continued higher inflationary conditions and no additional impacts from the pandemic we continue to anticipate broadbased strength and purchase volume as consumer savings declines and payment rate moderates while on a lag we also expect purchase volume growth to moderate given the strong purchase volume and loan receivables growth weve achieved in the first half of this year we expect ending loan receivables to grow in excess of versus the prior year to the extent that payment rate moderates further we would anticipate purchase volume to moderate and loan receivable growth to accelerate we expect our net interest margin to be approximately for the full year as we move through the back half net interest margin will be modestly lower due to the impacts of seasonal funding to support growth our net synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 interest margin outlook also reflects the anticipated impact of rising benchmark rates as well as the increase in interest and fees driven by the primary movement in payment rate moderation higher interest and fees will be partially offset by the impact of reversals as credit normalizes and the impact of benchmark rates on funding to that end we now expect net chargeoffs of approximately for the full year reflecting the strong credit performance we experienced in the first half as we move through the second half of the year we continue to expect delinquency to rise modestly we continue to expect reserve builds in to be generally assetdriven absent a meaningful change in the macroeconomic environment rsa expense will continue to reflect the impact of strong program performance and robust purchase volume growth but should continue to moderate as net chargeoffs rise we now expect rsa as a percent of average loan receivables to be approximately for the full year in terms of other expense we continue to expect quarterly levels to be approximately billion this outlook excludes the impact of the million gain on sale that we are reinvesting in our business this year as a reminder we deployed million of the gain on sale proceeds in and expect to deploy the remaining million to million in the second half such that the gain in reinvestments will be eps neutral for the full year we remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage to the extent that our receivables or revenue growth is not tracking ahead of expense growth for the full year we will moderate our spending where appropriate while still prioritizing the best longterm investments example of such is the opportunity might be to lower the workforce additions or reducing other discretionary spending so to conclude synchrony is operating from a position of strength as we progress through we are confident in our business ability to continue to deliver sustainable attractive riskadjusted growth and resilient peerleading range of riskadjusted returns even if market conditions change ill now turn the call back over to brian for his closing thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian very few consumer financing providers in the market today have synchronys unique combination of broad customer base and wide range of partners and providers diverse product suite and deep distribution channels innovative technology capabilities and robust funding capital and liquidity synchronys core strengths enable us to consistently and efficiently connect our customers and our partners and provide continuity through highquality outcomes including the right financing product at the right time with attractive value propositions and a bestinclass experience for our customers incremental customers with stronger lifetime value for our partners and sustainable growth and consistently strong riskadjusted returns for our stakeholders and with that ill turn the call back to kathryn to open the qa kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session operator instructions operator please start the qa session synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question is from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey ryan brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so brian maybe can you impact the net interest margin guidance a bit i think you said hikes which is a little below the market and i guess is the change in guidance reflective of the outperformance or any other drivers and maybe can you just talk about the deposit pricing strategy from here given the pace of hike and whats included in for betas in terms of the updated margin guidance brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yes thanks ryan ill try to unpack that question in pieces so the first is when we look at our reserve modeling and how we think about the back half we use were probably at now as we said in the past we are generally interest rate insensitive were billion liability sensitive now so the fact that the rates kind of come through does not have a big impact on our business and really shouldnt reflect or shouldnt really impact our net interest margin in the back half of the year number one as you think about deposit betas this has been an interesting topic and i think people are looking back really to the last cycle quite a bit with regard to the betas and i think the important part is to understand for us as our issuer specific book we do have a bigger ph shift between savings and cds the duration is down a little bit from what used to be months to months but were savings now when you look at the rate starts where the rates were at the start of the cycle they are much higher than what they were at the start of this cycle so beta is a little bit higher its competitive were going to continue to move with the market but we have a lot of growth to fund in the back half of the year so the deposit betas will be slightly higher than the past cycle but clearly manageable i think as we think of margin in the back half of this year the real key is going to be how much liquidity we have in our average interest earning assets so we expect that whatever the interestbearing liability cost increase will be largely offset with higher interest and fee income so that will be almost ill call it neutral so to speak in the back half and then youre just going to feel the effects as we move into the third quarter to prefund growth for the fourth quarter that will cause what i would call a normal seasonal decline in margin as we move forward synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and if i can ask a followup maybe for both of you so the reserve today is at still above day one cecl despite obviously very low losses i know this partially is hard to answer but can you maybe just help us understand how you think about reserve building in a modest downturn maybe relative to past cycles and can you maybe just talk about how you think about the relationship between rising unemployment and losses in a recession just given the strong liquidity position that brian doubles had outlined that consumers are in in the prepared remarks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes let me take that ryan so i think if you were to think about where we are from a delinquency standpoint our reserve just on a modeled basis right a pure model would probably be lower than day one today so i know a lot of folks are sitting around saying well youre approaching day one given the credit performance you would argue that probably would have been lower than day one if were back in that period of time i think as we move forward were going to see the relationship that you normally see between unemployment and chargeoffs will hold for a little bit but i think given where it is how low it is given the high amount of savings similar to what we saw both back in and back in the gfc youll probably break correlation between unemployment and net chargeoff rate so i think its important to watch that but its also going to be important actions we take i think as people think about the path to normalization i think some people are underestimating were at such a low rate now we have the ability to take actions to control the chargeoff to the extent the macroeconomic environment deteriorates quickly thats very different than if we were at our mean net chargeoff rate so we would anticipate reserves as we move forward to mainly be growth driven and we hopefully will be able to manage if the macroeconomic deteriorates inside of what we think that mean loss rate is brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yes i think ryan just expand on that a little bit weve been pleasantly surprised all year by the strength of the consumer were running at below half of our target loss rate in the business so to brians point weve got a lot of room to move and well have plenty of time to move if we need to if we start to forecast a worsening macroeconomic scenario as we head into but the consumer from all aspects whether you look at spend whether you look at credit at this point in time is still really strong i think theyve got the excess savings i think twothirds of customers either saved a portion or all of the stimulus so thats going to take a few quarters to burn through and were looking at this every day and if we think as we move into i think we feel really good about how were positioned for the balance of this year but as we move into if we need to make some modifications to kind of keep us within our target loss rate well absolutely do that operator thank you we have our next question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 great thanks and brian doubles you talked a little bit about offering of additional products to existing customers maybe i was hoping you could kind of expand on that a little bit maybe talk about how you could do that what areas of the portfolio you think are best kind of situated for that and maybe what that could add to your growth rate over the intermediate term brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah sure moshe i think this is one of the most exciting things that were working on frankly is this multi product suite and these offerings for our partners and one of the things thats changed really over the last i would say over the last six months is partners in our discussions with them they realize that theres an opportunity for them to rationalize and be a little more thoughtful about their pointofsale and the products that they offer their customers and this is where we think we actually have a big advantage in that weve got a very robust product suite whether its a paying for a longerterm installment private label cobranded dual card we think of it almost like a menu where we can go into a partner and say look this is what we have these are the products that we think fit your customer based on their purchases and their spend patterns and theyre pretty excited about that and i think that the benefit also for us is we can do that in a way where were earning a very attractive return and at the same point we should be able to reduce costs for our partners and so i would just tell you theres a lot of engagement both big partners as well as small to midsized partners and the other big part of this that we dont spend enough time talking about is just the integration model and i think this is a big differentiator for us as well so as you know we have big partners we have small partners and providers in health wellness and they have i would say different needs in terms of how we integrate with them so well have a big partner that is very interested in a robust full api technology stack integration so its seamless within their app venmos a good example of that all the way down to the small dentists who needs something very simple where the customer can just apply while theyre sitting in the waiting room and we can offer that spectrum of integration solutions thats a really big deal because the one thing that weve seen which is really important right now is the technology resources that sit inside of our partners whether big or small they dont have the bandwidth frankly and we need to make it super easy for them to integrate our products our solutions give them access to those financing options clovers another great example thats we just announced were opening up setpay pay in inside of our app which sits on the clover platform thats a really big deal because that allows us to build something once and distribute it to thousands of partners all at the same time so as you think about our strategy to take a step back you really have to think about it as having a very comprehensive product suite to meet the needs of very different and diverse partners but then also what are your integration strategies and how do you make that seamless and easy for the partner base so again one of the most exciting things that were working on across the business right now moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc perfect thanks and just as a followup from a credit standpoint as you started the year there was some caution i guess you had some caution about how some of your customers who had been lets say received deferments elsewhere might perform and obviously that concern has kind of burned through could you just talk a little bit about and you mentioned a lot about the state of the liquidity of your customers what are you looking synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 at to kind of gauge their health at this stage i mean what are the key things that you would look at and say wow thats now thats better or were seeing that normalization continue thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes thanks moshe so i think when we think about the consumer today youre right the ones that received indiscernible forbearance was ones we tracked very early on in the year we continue to watch very closely the population of people who are still on student loan forbearance so were tracking that population of people as they move through from a performance standpoint we look at a couple of different things we obviously look at how a spending behavior pattern changes we drill in from a credit standpoint we drill into payment behavior pattern increases and watch who is paying statement pay whos paying the minimum pay whos paying between those two and see if we see any dramatic shifts that are occurring inside those populations and we look at that relative to credit grade and again we have not seen any real signs of a broadbased deterioration certain cohorts have migrated back to 2019ish pandemic levels but we have not seen broadbased deterioration that goes into the low unemployment that goes into hourly wages that goes into increased savings so theres a lot of things that are still in there so were watching a lot with regard to spending and behavioral patterns that are in there and again population of people really i think the student loans are the ones that are of the greatest interest to us right now operator thank you we have our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning betsy brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc brian doubles wanted to just dig in a little bit on the credit quality of the book you mentioned during your prepared remarks about how the portfolio has been skewing to prime superprime and wanted to get your sense as to how youre thinking about that trajcects over the next year or so maybe even just a couple of quarters if you want im wondering if youre anticipating that with the new programs that will continue and how that is at all ameliorated by the increase in the near prime subprime portfolio increasing their borrowing as inflation continues to kick in here just wondering how you think that trajects thanks synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yes look ill start and ask brian to comment look i think the portfolio has never been in better shape than it is right now no matter how you look at it you look at the delinquencies the loss rate roughly half of what we would target in this kind of environment coupled with the fact that weve seen this really strong migration which has been intentional over time to skew more prime and less subprime and i think were not contemplating anything as we move into the back half of this year into that would change that profile we feel again really good about the operating environment right now if you remember going back when losses started to reach these alltime lows we didnt take the opportunity to open up on underwriting if anything what we did was we kind of dialed back some of the cuts that we made or modifications that we made in the beginning of the pandemic but we stayed very disciplined and there were clearly opportunities where we could have went deeper where we could have put our foot on the gas but we knew that we were in this window where the consumer was really stronger benefiting from the stimulus but we didnt take that opportunity to go a lot deeper in fact we maintained our discipline and thats how were going to continue to run the business through the back half of the year and into and so i wouldnt envision a big shift in that prime near prime mix i dont know brian if youd add anything brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes the two things id probably add is one origination of new accounts today underindexes into nonprime so i think from that standpoint to echo brians comments were not ph leaning in there lines continue to be lower in the nonprime segment than prepandemic levels i do think over the course of time you will see the nonprime migrate up a little bit as you continue to see the unwind of score migration that happened during the pandemic and as balances return back to a more normalized level but thats not really underwritingdriven thats really a reversal of the trend that you saw during the pandemic betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then on the followup this is a really nittygritty little question so sorry for the question but on page in the guide on credit normalization youre saying that dqs credit normalization will continue with dqs rising modestly in and i think in the last deck you used the word slow rise so what am i supposed to take from that like modestly and slow rise seem to me to be the same type of message but maybe im wrong there brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes betsy first of all we do appreciate all questions even if they are nittygritty so what i tip back and say youre going to see modest rise its not changing perspective with regard credit has overperformed in the first half of the year which means the starting point in the back half is a little bit differently but we dont see a drastically different trajectory from where we are here through the end of the year credit will be better for the entire year than when we sat here days ago and most certainly six months ago but we feel really good about credit as we move through the back half of the year and we feel good how that sets us up to be honest with you in even given the uncertain macroeconomic background operator thank you we have our next question from john pancari with evercore isi synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial good morning brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi back to the reserve your comment that the reserves build from here should be more assetdriven does that mean that you think a stable reserve ratio is likely for the near term and then also from a cecl perspective i know you indicated in your broader economic guidance you expected economy to slow so even from a cecl perspective wouldnt that warrant some creditrelated reserve build as the economic scenarios that you factor in worsen thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes thanks for the question john so the way we look at the model obviously we have the base credit model that looks at the delinquency formation today and how that rolls out to loss over our reasonable supportable period we have done a number of overlays on there which are more stressful with regard to how the consumer will evolve and how the macroeconomic situation evolve so i think with those overlays you get to a point where we have what i would call an elevated reserve relative to day one cecl and where the portfolio sits today absent that so i think as you think about moving forward in the environment to the extent that an adverse situation an adverse macroeconomic situation develops those overlays in theory become embedded into the core reserve model and therefore you have growthdriven reserve here over the near term operator thank you our next question is from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i guess first question is on the rsa obviously you guys expect it to now be at the low end of the prior guidance im just curious whats driving that i was a little surprised because the loss rate also is expected to be lower and that usually the two kind of work in inverse ways so maybe if you could just talk about that brian wenzel brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 yeah you have two different dynamics you have obviously some of the operating favorability that you have coming through there is mix that comes through here as well as gap coming out of the portfolio that brings you back down that operated at a slightly higher rsa percent all that brings you down to the lower end of the range sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and so going forward we should expect it to be more correlated to the various operating metrics given gaps out brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah yes it should correlate to it we also back on page of the deck we also one of the things that i know people are trying to model rsas in a way that they can be more predictable i think we showed a metric here which is rsa relative to purchase volume because remember there is a significant portion of the rsas that is volume oriented that tends to be a more stable metric i think you can look at it quarteroverquarter seasonality and i think will help people as they try to build their models as they go through it again we do believe that were going to migrate back to that to level as net chargeoffs normalize and as the revenue interest of the revenue and yield normalize as well sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and my followup question is for brian doubles obviously you talked about the launch of pay in with on clover im just curious how much of that product is actually being utilized by merchants where you have a relationship versus not is it your own customers today and then also theres been a significant dislocation in valuations for players in this space im just curious if theres anything you might do differently on a goforward basis as a result of that thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah so sanjay i would say the majority right now is with existing partners thats where weve been having discussions over the past nine months give or take and integrating and launching what i would tell you though is clover is really an opportunity for us to reach a broader distribution of partners that dont do business with us today and make it really easy and seamless for them just to download our app and then pick from our various financing options so thats really the exciting part as we think about going forward is that one to many integration opportunity which is frankly different than how weve managed the business in the past so i think thats an exciting part of our strategy going forward and then i would say just on valuations generally i think that does potentially create some opportunities for us we run a very active ma pipeline one of the things we were a little disappointed as we went through the pandemic we thought valuations would check up a little bit they did not but were starting to see some of that now and that could create some opportunities for us whether its capabilities that would be easier to buy than build some things like that but i would tell you we are very disciplined around ma we only look to do things that are not only strategic but also eps accretive and so weve got a pretty disciplined process around that so i think there may be some more opportunities here just on the margin but well maintain that discipline operator thank you our next question is from mihir bhatia with bank of america synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america good morning and thank you for taking my questions maybe i wanted to start with asking about loyalty program costs those have been increasing whether we look at it as a percentage of interchange revenue or purchase volume and i was curious as to what is driving that is that just competition or are there particular programs renewals promotions ongoing that is making that line inflect higher just trying to understand how you expect that line to shake out longer term i think historically it used to be around of interchange revenue maybe a little bit more but its pretty materially higher now so just trying to understand more context there brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes thank you first of all good morning mihir yes so id say this is less a function of competition more a function of weve done some value props over the past months to months and we are seeing increased purchase volume through that as our value propositions have resonated with consumers so there isnt necessarily a reflection of changing to the competitive environment ph to refreshing value props that we normally do and weve done it across a number of different programs which is driving some of the higher loyalty again some of the loyalty sits on our books the vast majority sits with our partners which is why the rsa is what it is because theyre paying the value prop cost from their proceeds out of the rsa i think as you look forward one of the interesting things youre going to see youll see it really began in the third quarter is theres roughly million of interchange that we will lose as our portfolios we sold this quarter have gone away and the loyalty costs were borne by those partners so what youll see is in theory a widening of that gap beginning in the third quarter as we move out the offset to that million call it 80plus percent comes out of the rsa so they move in different directions but from a pl standpoint its neutral again i think in most programs where we collect interchange and we pay the value prop its the same some of the programs you got to remember are ones where we dont collect interchange that are private label products where we may be paying a loyalty cost and again this goes back into we had record purchase volume ever for this company during this quarter we had record purchase volume last year for this company record purchase volume for the first quarter of this year so that volume is going to generate higher loyalty costs so its less about renewals and other things its really about our products resonating with consumers mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america thank you that is very helpful thank you and then just wanted to follow up a little bit on betsys question about just the credit profile evolution how much of that is being driven by just your underwriting standards maybe just talk about what those look like today versus say or even just trying to understand how things are changing in the context of indiscernible brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes so if you walk through the pandemic right the early stages call it the beginning part of the second quarter we tightened our standards right now again we are very different than most credit card issuers we dont pull back entirely its our distribution model so we dont necessarily do that we tend to do things that we would call synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 smarter with regard to credit so instead of giving someone a dual card well give them a private label card were a little bit more restrictive on some of the growth related credit line increases so we wouldnt do proactive credit line increases and at the margin we would tighten up origination i think as we moved into the second quarter of when we saw the environment not being as potentially pessimistic as we did a year earlier we began to unwind some of those actions and some of those refinements so again i think if you look at the standards that exist today theyre probably a little bit tighter than i think levels but approaching that but our line sizes again are lower but the good news is i think we continue to introduce different data points into our decisions that makes us allows us to make smarter decisions both at the time of origination and at the time in which were doing account management ie authorizations et cetera that allows us to have a better profile i think when we look at the vintages in and they still are outperforming that of and the vintage a little bit worse than because again we had probably a looser refinement strategy in versus but both are significantly better than prepandemic levels and i think sets us up and thats one of the keys it sets us up for what were going to see in so were very as we sit here today optimistic about the credit profile of the company operator thank you we have our next question from brian foran with autonomous research brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning i was actually going to ask about the vintages which you just touched on but is there any sense you can give on the magnitude of outperformance versus delinquencies controlled for month seasoning or however you want to measure it just trying to get a sense of is it a little or a lot or somewhere in between on how much the and vintages are outperforming brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial what id say is is probably in the middle between and and is significantly lower is probably how id frame it brian we dont break out actual performance of the vintage themselves with regard to coincident delinquency or loss rate but as a frame of reference 2021s in the middle but significantly below brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp and then maybe on competitive intensity i mean you touched a lot of different competitors i guess broadly maybe its fair to say your traditional card competitors are maybe still getting a little bit more intense competitively or maybe reaching a plateau but against that theres been a pretty big retrenchment seen since some of the newer fintech competitors so maybe two questions when you balance it all out is it kind of a net neutral or is competition actually maybe pulling back because of the fintech side and any opportunities that that fintech retrenchment does present i know you touched on maybe some of the ma but maybe organic opportunities that it presents brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 yeah i think the competitive set has been fairly stable actually i dont think that whether youre a mature competitor one of our larger competitors or the smaller fintechs i dont think that theyve changed their strategies or their competitive intensity plus or minus given the uncertainty as we head into and i think you might see some of that as we get more to the back half of the year and some of these signs become a little bit more real if that does materialize but i would say the competitive set has been pretty consistent pricing and economics has continued to be pretty rational one of the things that we were looking for as we went through the pandemic is do we start to see competition really take advantage of a best ever credit environment i think we saw some of that on the fintech side but the more traditional competitors stayed pretty disciplined we stayed disciplined i think that will be helpful going forward and i think the real question is what does this look like as we head into and beyond operator thank you we have our next question from kevin barker with piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you you mentioned some additional macro overlays on your reserving ratios or just looking at your overall cecl reserving could you give us a little bit more detail on some of those major macro overlays that you have embedded within the reserving and then at what point would you start to say that the reserving level needs to rise or like what unemployment rate would you say we start to need to see significant moves in the reserve level brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks kevin so when you look at our baseline model we start with the moodys baseline which is generally going to be a flat what i would call unemployment environment and a gdp thats generally flat to decelerating over the next couple of years i think when we start to look at the allowance and look at the overlays that get put in there right were looking at forecasts that have the cpi accelerating so we think about it in two different ways the first is probably the easiest way to think about it is late stage performance so we think about it as you have a deteriorating unemployment environment that stresses your latestage delinquencies which will flow through the model rather quickly thats really where we look at it we look at it in that context of being the roll rates that exist in that overlay as being more dramatic than what we saw prepandemic level so its a faster roll to loss the other ph little overlay that we put on it is really related to what we say is related coming out of the russiaukraine war that we see out there and what that does is we have early stage deteriorating more quickly an upswing in bankruptcies which are probably at historic lows and that flows through the model with not as much deterioration in the back end or a severe deterioration in the back end so you have a much bigger piece flowing through the model so those are the ways in which weve kind of done the overlays lets try to correlate it because again i think kevin the one thing thats demonstrated a couple of periods of time here is that you have seen a dislocation between what had been very correlated metrics unemployment to loss traditionally youll see a correlation between gas prices and entry rate in what i would call early stage performance were not seeing that today so youve broken correlation and thats really because of the effects of the stimulus and the forbearance that come through synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 so we have taken it really in two different ways and two different scenarios to create different overlays which is one a severe backend deterioration and two a more frontend deterioration that flows through with what i would call a sharper increase in nonaged losses kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co so given the uncertainty that we have out there and the different macro scenarios that could play out and obviously the cycle could be different have you considered being a little bit more conservative in deploying capital in this environment just given the uncertainty we have in the outlook brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial a couple of things kevin one were operating at over basis points above our cet1 so start there were in a very different position than probably all of our peers and those in the banking industry so start with that premise number one two under most scenarios we have a strong business that generates a lot of capital and even under stress scenario we didnt lose money during the pandemic in any quarter so we continued to generate capital during that period three we just got done with our preliminary run of our second quarter stress test our normal stress test and then we run the moodys s6 and s7 stress tests and we remain in a very solid position so as we look at the environment as we sit here today look at those stress look at our position we dont believe theres a reason today to curtail our current share repurchase plans that being said we continually look at the macroeconomic environment and we continue to look at our ability to generate capital through earnings and if we need to make an adjustment similar to march of we will but again as we sit here today given the stress that we run the severe stress that we run we feel comfortable with our current capital plan thats in place operator thank you we have time for one more question our final question is from mark devries with barclays mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yes thank you really appreciate all the color you gave on kind of what youre observing from spend behavior given the inflationary pressures are you seeing any though any kind of divergence in trend across the credit spectrum or are those trends pretty consistent from kind of superprime all the way down to nonprime brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes so what id say mark is were seeing positive what i would call transaction values and frequency and consistency of frequency across all credit grades i think the strongest credit ph grading we see is actually in the prime so not superprime and not nonprime but we are seeing continued strength in the non prime so theres nothing discernible as i look across the credit grade either on a transaction value basis or a frequency basis nor do we see it across any of the sales platforms its remarkably consistent the performance and the growth across all the platforms by credit grade synchrony financial syf corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2022 so again i think when we look at the data and i look at the data by category what were seeing is that the consumer is not changing spending dollarwise and their behaviors theyre just making different decisions inside their everyday spend and its not even just moving from discretionary nondiscretionary theyre just being more discriminate with regard to how theyre spending their money and it really goes to the power of the diversification that we have in our sales platforms and inside of our sales platforms mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc got it and then just a followup the payment rate also doesnt really seem to be getting affected given inflation which seems pretty bullish but kind of what are your expectations for that as we kind of look out for the back half of the year brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes again weve anticipated that youre going to see a moderation in the payment rate as we move back we have seen a little bit of a shift in the payment behavior patterns between statement pays and min pays in between so weve seen some of that moderation weve seen some cohorts go back to levels we expect it to begin to migrate back the migration ill be honest with you from our expectations back in january has been a little bit slower than we anticipated which just goes back to the overall strength of the consumer but we do expect it to slow just probably a little bit slower pace than i anticipated at the beginning part of the year which again is positive from a credit standpoint and again the strength in our purchase volume is helping us to get to that 10plus percent loan receivable growth by the end of the year operator brian thank you thank you ladies and
