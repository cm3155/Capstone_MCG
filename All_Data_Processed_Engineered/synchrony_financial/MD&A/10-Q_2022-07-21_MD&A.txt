item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report and in our the tax return in the current year additionally we are under examination in various states going back to we believe that there are no issues or claims that are likely to significantly impact our results of operations financial position or cash flows we further believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties that could result from such examinations note legal proceedings and regulatory matters in the normal course of business from time to time we have been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business activities certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we are also involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental agencies regarding our business collectively regulatory matters which could subject us to significant fines penalties obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses diminished income and damage to our reputation we contest liability andor the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter in accordance with applicable accounting guidance we establish an accrued liability for legal and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies which are both probable and reasonably estimable legal proceedings and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance and we may be exposed to losses in excess of any amounts accrued for some matters we are able to determine that an estimated loss while not probable is reasonably possible for other matters including those that have not yet progressed through discovery andor where important factual information and legal issues are unresolved we are unable to make such an estimate we currently estimate that the reasonably possible losses for legal proceedings and regulatory matters whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability and for which we are able to estimate a possible loss are immaterial this represents managements estimate of possible loss with respect to these matters and is based on currently available information this estimate of possible loss does not represent our maximum loss exposure the legal proceedings and regulatory matters underlying the estimate will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from current estimates our estimate of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings the existence of numerous yet to be resolved issues the breadth of the claims often spanning multiple years unspecified damages andor the novelty of the legal issues presented based on our current knowledge we do not believe that we are a party to any pending legal proceeding or regulatory matters that would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition or liquidity however in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on among other factors the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our earnings for that period and could adversely affect our business and reputation below is a description of certain of our regulatory matters and legal proceedings on november a putative class action lawsuit retail wholesale
