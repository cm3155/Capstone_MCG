item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report and in our of this report the duration and magnitude of the effects of covid19 continue to be unknown and as such the expectations and guidance for provided during the companys earnings conference call on january can no longer be relied upon while the magnitude of the impact from covid19 is uncertain and difficult to predict we anticipate the following key trends will be affected growth in loan receivables and interest income we have experienced significant declines in consumer purchase activity following the outbreak of covid19 and associated governmental preventative measures such as closures of nonessential businesses interest and fees on loans decreased for the three months ended june primarily due to the sale of the walmart consumer portfolio sale which drove a decline compared to the prior year period of approximately the remaining decrease in interest and fees on loans along with a decline in loan receivables of and a reduction in purchase volume for our ongoing partners of in all instances for the quarter ended june were primarily due to the impacts of covid19 in addition we have experienced a reduction in benchmark interest rates and we have also provided for a temporary period of time forbearance in terms of waivers of interest and fees and deferrals of minimum payments for qualifying cardholders that are impacted by covid19 and request relief the decreases in loan receivables and benchmark interest rates along with the forbearance actions have led to the reductions in interest income for the three months ended june while initial economic reopening phases have led to growth in purchase volume compared to the prior year for the last two weeks of the second quarter of we expect the above factors will likely result in a reduction in the growth of our interest income for the remainder of as noted above the extent of the impacts from these conditions is currently uncertain and dependent on various factors these factors include the nature of and duration for which the preventative measures remain in place including responses to recent increases in covid19 infections nationally and the type of any additional stimulus measures and other policy responses that the us government may adopt adoption of asu financial instrumentscredit losses measurement of credit losses on financial instruments cecl in response to the covid19 pandemic in march the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was signed into law and includes a provision that permits financial institutions to defer temporarily the use of cecl however in a related action the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that allows banking organizations to mitigate the effects of the cecl accounting standard in their regulatory capital banking organizations that are required under us accounting standards to adopt cecl this year can elect to mitigate the estimated cumulative regulatory capital effects of cecl for up to two years this twoyear delay is in addition to the threeyear transition period that the agencies had already made available the company has elected to adopt the option provided by the interim final rule which will largely delay the effects of cecl on its regulatory capital for the next two years after which the effects will be phasedin over a threeyear period from january through december under the interim final rule the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital deferred until the phasein period includes both the initial impact of our adoption of cecl at january and of subsequent changes in our allowance for credit losses during each quarter of the twoyear period ended december asset quality prior to covid19 we had experienced slightly improving asset quality trends that reflected stable us unemployment rates and consumer confidence in addition over30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of periodend loan receivables decreased to at june from at june primarily driven by an improvement in customer payment behavior and the effects of the sale of the walmart consumer portfolio forbearance actions we have taken for our customers impacted by covid19 have also contributed to a temporary reduction in the companys delinquencies as customers are not incurring changes to their delinquent status while enrolled in this shortterm program these accounts may not advance to the next delinquency cycle including eventually to chargeoff in the same time frame that would have occurred had the forbearance relief not been granted we anticipate that the current levels of filings for unemployment benefits in the united states while partially mitigated by the effects of governmental actions such as the cares act which included unemployment benefits currently scheduled to expire in july will result in an increase in the companys delinquencies and net chargeoff rate in the second half of and into as compared to the prior year similarly we have experienced an increase to our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses during the three and six months ended june attributable to the impact of covid19 to the extent the current environment continues beyond our expectations or deteriorates further we may experience further increases to our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses related to covid19 retailer share arrangement payments under our program agreements to the extent we experience further reductions in interest income and also increases in expected net chargeoffs related to covid19 discussed above we expect that the growth in absolute terms of our payments to our partners under our retailer share arrangements compared to the prior year will decrease for a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties relating to covid19 for our results of operations and business condition see item risk factors for a discussion of how certain trends and conditions impacted the three and six months ended june see results of operations seasonality                                                                                              in our retail card and payment solutions platforms we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from august through a peak in late december with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down the seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations delinquency metrics and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods in addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net chargeoff rates in the first and second quarters our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net chargeoff rates in the third and fourth quarters because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in chargeoffs as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end consistent with this historical experience we generally experience a higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period as compared to the end of a calendar year in addition despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end reflecting these same seasonal trends results of operations                                                                                              highlights for the three and six months ended june below are highlights of our performance for the three and six months ended june compared to the three and six months ended june as applicable except as otherwise noted net earnings decreased to million for the three months ended june primarily driven by lower net interest income and higher provision for credit losses partially offset by decreases in retailer share arrangements and other expense net earnings decreased to million for the six months ended june primarily driven by higher provision for credit losses as well as lower net interest income partially offset by decreases in retailer share arrangements and other expense these changes were primarily due to the impact of covid19 and the effects from the sale of the walmart consumer portfolio in we adopted the new cecl accounting guidance in january and recorded an increase to our allowance for loan losses of billion in addition the increases in provision for credit losses for the three and six months ended june included million or million aftertax and million or million aftertax respectively attributable to applying the new cecl guidance as compared to the prior accounting guidance loan receivables decreased to billion at june compared to june primarily driven by lower purchase volume and a decrease in average active accounts for our ongoing partner programs due to the impact of covid19 as well as the sale of loan receivables associated with the yamaha portfolio net interest income decreased to billion and to billion for the three and six months ended june respectively primarily due to a decrease in interest and fees on loans due to the walmart consumer portfolio sale and the impact of covid19 partially offset by a decrease in interest expense reflecting lower benchmark interest rates retailer share arrangements decreased to million and to billion for the three and six months ended june respectively reflecting the initial impact of covid19 on program performance over30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of periodend loan receivables decreased basis points to at june and the net chargeoff rate decreased basis points to and basis points to for the three and six months ended june respectively provision for credit losses increased by million or and or for the three and six months ended june respectively primarily driven by a higher reserve build reflecting the projected impacts of covid19 the increases attributable to cecl discussed above and the effects of the prior year reductions in reserves for credit losses of million and million respectively related to the walmart consumer portfolio sale our allowance coverage ratio allowance for credit losses as a percent of periodend loan receivables increased to at june as compared to at june primarily due to the impact of the cecl implementation and impacts from covid19 other expense decreased by million or and million or for the three and six months ended june respectively primarily driven by the cost reductions related to the sale of the walmart consumer portfolio the lower purchase volume and average active accounts experienced in the current quarter and reductions in certain discretionary spend these decreases were partially offset by higher operational losses expenditures related to our response to covid19 and charitable contributions made in the

account vintages account seasoning economic conditions recent trends in delinquencies account collection management forecasting uncertainties expectations about the future and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses we estimate our allowance for credit card loan losses using pools of homogeneous loans further experience is not available for new portfolios therefore while we accumulate experience we utilize our experience with the most closely analogous products and segments in our portfolio the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and expectations about the future and are subject to the regulatory examination process which can result in changes to our assumptions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for credit losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates of expected credit losses see managements discussion and analysiscritical accounting estimates in our s policy changes and loan volumes and amounts holistically for assessing the portfolio credit loss content we also evaluate portfolio risk management techniques applied to various accounts historical behavior of different account vintages account seasoning economic conditions recent trends in delinquencies account collection management forecasting uncertainties expectations about the future and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses we regularly review our collection experience including delinquencies and net chargeoffs in determining our allowance for credit losses we also consider our historical loss experience to date based on actual defaulted loans and overall portfolio indicators including delinquent and nonaccrual loans trends in loan volume and lending terms credit policies and other observable environmental factors such as unemployment and home price indices the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current and forecasted conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process which can result in changes to our assumptions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for credit losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates chargeoffs are deducted from the allowance for credit losses when we judge the principal to be uncollectible and subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance generally at the time cash is received on a chargedoff account delinquent receivables are those that are days or more past due based on their contractual payments nonaccrual loan receivables are those on which we have stopped accruing interest we continue to accrue interest until the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes days past due with the exception of noncredit card accounts for which we stop accruing interest in the period that the account becomes days past due troubled debt restructurings tdr are those loans for which we have granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties where we do not receive adequate compensation tdrs are identified at the point when the borrower enters into a modification program under the cares act banks may elect to deem that loan modifications do not result in tdrs if they are related to the novel coronavirus disease covid19 executed on a loan that was not more than days past due as of december and executed between march and the earlier of a days after the date of termination of the national emergency or b december at june we have not made such an election additionally other shortterm modifications made on a good faith basis in response to covid19 are not considered tdrs under asc subtopic this includes delays in payment that are insignificant or shortterm eg up to six months modifications such as payment deferrals fee waivers or extensions of repayment terms to borrowers who were current prior to any relief borrowers considered current are those that are less than days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented the same loan receivable may meet more than one of the definitions above accordingly these categories are not mutually exclusive and it is possible for a particular loan to meet the definitions of a tdr and nonaccrual loan and be included in each of these categories the categorization of a particular loan also may not be indicative of the potential for loss loan modifications and restructurings our loss mitigation strategy is intended to minimize economic loss and at times can result in rate reductions principal forgiveness extensions or other actions which may cause the related loan to be classified as a tdr we use longterm modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a loss mitigation strategy to improve longterm collectability of the loans that are classified as tdrs the longterm program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than months and reducing the interest rate on the loan the longterm program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments we also make loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources such as a consumer credit counseling agency program the loans that are modified typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal interest or fees the determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions meet the tdr criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances accordingly tdrs are identified at the point when the borrower enters into a modification program see note loan receivables and allowance for credit losses for additional information on our loan modifications and restructurings our allowance for credit losses on tdrs is generally measured based on the difference between the recorded loan receivable and the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan if the loan is collateral dependent we measure impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs data related to redefault experience is also considered in our overall reserve adequacy review once the loan has been modified it returns to current status reaged only after three consecutive minimum monthly payments are received post modification date subject to a reaging limitation of once a year or twice in a fiveyear period in accordance with the federal financial institutions examination council guidelines on uniform retail credit classification and account management policy issued in june revenue recognition purchased loans loans acquired by purchase are recorded at fair value which may result in the recognition of a loan premium or loan discount for acquired loans with evidence of morethaninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination the initial allowance for credit losses at acquisition is added to the purchase price to determine the initial cost basis of the loans and loan premium or loan discount loan premiums and loan discounts are recognized into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the loans the company develops an allowance for credit losses for all purchased loans which is recognized upon acquisition similar to that of an originated financial asset subsequent changes to the expected credit losses for these loans follow the allowance for credit losses methodology described above under allowance for credit losses see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our annual consolidated financial statements in our examination during the period in connection with the cap program the irs provided formal notice of examination of our and tax years we believe that there are no issues or claims that are likely to significantly impact our results of operations financial position or cash flows we further believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties that could result from such examinations note legal proceedings and regulatory matters in the normal course of business from time to time we have been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business activities certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages we are also involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental agencies regarding our business collectively regulatory matters which could subject us to significant fines penalties obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses diminished income and damage to our reputation we contest liability andor the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter in accordance with applicable accounting guidance we establish an accrued liability for legal and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies which are both probable and reasonably estimable legal proceedings and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance and we may be exposed to losses in excess of any amounts accrued for some matters we are able to determine that an estimated loss while not probable is reasonably possible for other matters including those that have not yet progressed through discovery andor where important factual information and legal issues are unresolved we are unable to make such an estimate we currently estimate that the reasonably possible losses for legal proceedings and regulatory matters whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability and for which we are able to estimate a possible loss are immaterial this represents managements estimate of possible loss with respect to these matters and is based on currently available information this estimate of possible loss does not represent our maximum loss exposure the legal proceedings and regulatory matters underlying the estimate will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from current estimates our estimate of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment given the varying stages of the proceedings the existence of numerous yet to be resolved issues the breadth of the claims often spanning multiple years unspecified damages andor the novelty of the legal issues presented based on our current knowledge we do not believe that we are a party to any pending legal proceeding or regulatory matters that would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition or liquidity however in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on among other factors the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our earnings for that period and could adversely affect our business and reputation below is a description
