including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses we may also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or

generally do not require the members or dealers to offer our products to their customers under the terms of the program agreements buying groups and industry associations generally agree to support and promote the respective programs these arrangements may include signup fees and volumebased incentives paid by us to the groups and their members synchronybranded networks our synchronybranded networks are focused on specific industries where we create either companybranded or company and partnerbranded private label credit cards that are usable across all participating locations within the

as a managing general agent this acquisition allows carecredit to offer comprehensive financial options to consumers for veterinary care carecredit partners the vast majority of our partners are individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers which includes networks of healthcare practitioners that provide elective and other procedures that generally are not fully covered by insurance the remainder are primarily national and regional healthcare providers and healthfocused retailers such as pharmacies at december we had a network of carecredit providers and healthfocused retailers that collectively have over locations during over locations either processed a carecredit application or made a sale on a carecredit credit card no one carecredit partner accounted for more than of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended december we enter into provider agreements with individual healthcare providers who become part of our carecredit network these provider agreements are similar to the dealer agreements that govern our relationships with the merchants and dealers offering our payment solutions products in that the agreements are not exclusive and typically may be terminated at will upon days notice multiyear agreements are in place for larger multilocation relationships across all markets there are typically no retailer share arrangements with partners in carecredit at december we had relationships with over professional and other associations including the american dental association and the american veterinary medical association

certifications and meets our underwriting criteria we also screen potential partners for reputational issues we work with professional and other associations manufacturers buying groups industry associations and healthcare consultants to educate their constituents about the products and services we offer we believe our ability to attract new partners is aided by our customer satisfaction rate

platforms we work directly with our partners using their distribution network communication channels and customer interactions to market our products to their existing and potential customers we believe our presence at partners points of sale instore online and mobile locations and our ability to make credit decisions instantly for a customer already predisposed to make a purchase enables us to acquire new customer accounts at a lower cost than issuers of general purpose cards to acquire new customers we collaborate and deeply integrate with our partners and leverage our marketing

technology allows us to process customer information obtained from our partners through our risk models such that when these customers seek to make payment for goods and services at our partners pointsofsale we can offer them credit instantly if appropriate based on our experience due to the personalized and immediate nature of the offer quickscreen significantly outperforms traditional directtoconsumer preapproved channels such as direct mail or email in response rate and dollar spending in payment solutions we also market the value of crossnetwork benefits to our partners for example the synchrony car care credit card offers motorists the convenience of one card to pay for comprehensive auto care at thousands of service and parts locations as well as fuel at gas stations nationwide in addition we launched synchrony home network which allows customers to finance items from home décor to mattresses to flooring at thousands of participating home locations nationwide acquiring and marketing to carecredit customers we market our products through our network of providers by training them on the advantages of carecredit and by creating marketing materials for providers to use to promote the program and educate customers our training helps our providers learn to discuss payment options during the pretreatment consultation phase including the option to apply for a carecredit credit card and the offer of promotional credit according to a survey of our carecredit customers indicated they would have postponed or reduced the scope of treatment if financing was not offered by their provider consumers can apply for our carecredit products in the providers office or online via the web or mobile device as the market continues to evolve we are increasingly seeing more customers from mobile and internet channels consumers are going online to look for information about the types of procedures or care they need where to receive that care and how to pay for it as such we are promoting carecredit directly to potential and existing customers using digital marketing our provider locator on our website allows customers to search among the more than locations that accept the carecredit credit card by desired geography and provider type according to our records our carecredit provider locator averaged over million searches per month during the year ended december we believe our partners recognize the locator as an important source of new customer acquisition and information about their practice we believe going direct to consumers through digital marketing will have several benefits customers will have a better understanding of the types of care they can pay for the different financing options available and where they can use carecredit in addition whether they choose to apply online or in the providers office once approved they can move forward with the care they want or need to feel better enterprise customer engagement ece analytics after a customer obtains one of our products our marketing programs encourage ongoing card usage by communicating the benefits of our products value propositions examples of such programs include promotional financing offers cardholder events product and partner discounts dollaroff certificates account holder sales reward points and offers new product announcements and previews and other specific partner value offerings these programs are executed through our partners and our own direct to consumer distribution channels our ece and data analytics teams help us optimize these programs through detailed testandlearn tracking of cardholder responsiveness and subsequent behavior this data is leveraged by applying machine learning and other analytic techniques to create tools that allow for customized marketing messages and promotional offers to cardholders for example if a cardholder consistently responds to a coupon sent by text message versus other channels we will tailor future marketing messages to be delivered by text message and use such insight to identify other populations that are likely to behave in similar ways our dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card programs are further enhanced by the collection and analysis of data on customers spend patterns at both our partners and at other retailers the objective of these efforts is to drive incremental volume for our programs while maximizing return on investment our extensive marketing activities targeted to existing customers have yielded high levels of reuse across both our payment solutions and

component of our management and growth strategy credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from customer default when customers are unable or unwilling to meet their financial obligations to us our credit risk arising from credit products is generally highly diversified across approximately million open accounts at december without significant individual exposures we manage credit risk primarily according to customer segments and product types customer account acquisition we have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and have developed varying credit decision guidelines for the different partners we originate credit accounts through several different channels including instore mail internet mobile telephone and preapproved solicitations in addition we have and may in the future acquire accounts that were originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners regardless of the channel in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit we follow a series of credit risk and underwriting procedures in most cases when applications are made instore or by internet or mobile the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of our credit decision immediately we generally obtain certain information provided by the applicant and obtain a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus the credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary scoring models developed to calculate a credit score the credit risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line assignments for each portfolio and product type we periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to projected performance and adjust the minimum score or the opening credit limit to manage credit risk we also apply additional application screens based on various inputs including credit bureau information alternative data our previous experience with the customer and information provided by our partner to help identify additional factors such as potential fraud and prior bankruptcies before qualifying the application for approval we compare applicants names against the specially designated nationals list maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury ofac as well as screens that account for adherence to usa patriot act of the patriot act and credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the card act requirements including ability to pay requirements we also use preapproved account solicitations for certain programs potential applicants are prescreened using information provided by our partner or obtained from outside lists and qualified individuals receive a preapproved credit offer by mail or email acquired portfolio evaluation our risk management team evaluates each portfolio that we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies our credit risk guidelines as part of this review we receive data on the thirdparty accounts and loans which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain core characteristics such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information in addition we benchmark potential portfolio acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks finally our risk management team must approve the acquisition taking into account the results of our risk assessment process once assets are migrated to our systems our account management protocols will apply immediately as described below under customer account management credit authorizations of individual transactions and collections customer account management we regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts this ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customers performance with respect to their account with us as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customers broader credit performance to monitor and control the quality of our loan portfolio including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to score each active account on its monthly cycle date proprietary risk models together with the credit scores obtained on each active account no less than quarterly are an integral part of our credit decisionmaking process depending on the duration of the customers account risk profile and other performance metrics the account may be subject to a range of account actions including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits credit authorizations of individual transactions once an account has been opened when a credit card is used to make a purchase instore at one of our partners locations or online pointofsale terminals or online sites have an online connection with our credit authorization system which allows for realtime updating of accounts each potential sales transaction is passed through a transaction authorization system which considers a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be approved or declined and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted fraud investigation we provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings new account fraud and transactional fraud we have developed a proprietary fraud model to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customers established pattern our proprietary model is also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our customers we also are continuously implementing new and improved technologies to detect and prevent fraud such as utilizing embedded security chips emv for our active dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card products with all our retail partners collections all monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts collections personnel generally initiate contact with customers within days after any portion of their balance becomes past due the nature and the timing of the initial contact typically a personal call email text message or letter are determined by a review of the customers prior account activity and payment habits we reevaluate our collection efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques including internal collection activities use of external vendors and the sale of debt to thirdparty buyers as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent we limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the transaction authorization processes the imposition of credit limits and criteriabased account suspension and revocation processes in certain situations we may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules decrease interest rates andor waive fees to aid customers experiencing financial difficulties in their efforts to become current on their obligations to us customer service                                                                                              customer service is an important feature of our relationship

payment solutions programs which have dedicated toll free numbers our carecredit platform has its own dedicated tollfree customer service phone number we also have dedicated tollfree customer service phone numbers for our deposit business we service all programs through our nine domestic and three offshore call centers we blend domestic and offshore locations as an important part of our servicing strategy to maintain service availability beyond normal work hours in the united states and to seek optimal costs customer service for cards issued to customers in canada is supported through agents based in the united states given the nature of our business and the high volume of calls we maintain several centers of excellence to ensure the quality of our customer service across all of our sites examples of these centers of excellence include back office quality assurance customer experience training workforce and capacity planning surveillance and process control production services

                          products and services we leverage information technology to deliver products and services that meet the needs of our customers and partners and enables us to operate our business efficiently the integration of our technology with our partners is at the core of our value proposition enabling among other things customers to apply and buy at the point of sale and many of our partners to settle transactions directly with us without an interchange fee a key part of our strategic focus is the continued development of innovative efficient flexible technology and operational platforms to support marketing risk management account acquisition and account management customer service and new product innovation and development we believe that the continued investment in and development of these platforms is an important part of our efforts to increase our competitive capabilities reduce costs improve quality and provide faster more flexible technology services therefore we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems processes and competencies to meet our business needs as part of our continuous efforts to enhance our technological capabilities we may either develop these capabilities internally or in partnership with thirdparty providers our internal approach involves deployment of crossfunctional product teams often in collaboration with our partners focused on driving rapid delivery of inhouse product innovation and development and the commercialization of new products in addition at times we also partner with thirdparty providers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure based on strategies and in some cases architecture designed by us we leverage fiserv including their recent acquisition of first data for our credit card transaction processing and production and our retail banking operations data security the protection and security of financial and personal information of our consumers is one of our highest priorities we have implemented a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards that we believe provide an appropriate level of protection to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of our companys and our customers information this includes protecting against any known or evolving threats to the security or integrity of customer records and information and against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information our information security program is continuously adapting to an evolving landscape of emerging threats and available technology through data gathering and evaluation of emerging threats from internal and external incidents and technology investment security controls are adjusted on a continuous basis we work directly with our partners on an ongoing basis to expand our intelligence ecosystem and facilitate awareness and communications of events outside of the company we have developed a security strategy and implemented multiple layers of controls embedded throughout our technology environment that establish multiple control points between threats and our assets our security program is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store process or have access to sensitive data and we require the same level of protection from such thirdparty service providers we evaluate the effectiveness of the key security controls through ongoing assessment and measurement in addition we identify risks that may threaten customer information and utilize both internal and external resources to perform a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms systems and applications used to provide our products and services we employ backup and disaster recovery procedures for all the systems that are used for storing processing and transferring customer information and we periodically test and validate our disaster recovery plans further we regularly utilize independent assessors to evaluate the appropriateness of our overall program we are compliant with the payment card industry pci program intellectual

assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for losses which compares this allowance for losses to projected net chargeoffs over the next months in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance we do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis but instead estimate its allowance for credit card loan losses on a portfolio basis further experience is not available for new portfolios therefore while we are developing that experience we set loss allowances based on our experience with the most closely analogous products in our portfolio the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process which can result in changes to our assumptions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates in june the fasb issued asu financial instrumentscredit losses measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which is effective for the company on january this asu replaces the existing accounting standard for credit losses and will change the accounting model for how credit losses will be recognized in our consolidated financial statements see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies new accounting standards to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the new accounting standard for credit losses and its expected impact to the companys allowance for loan losses fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities as well as contingent consideration obligations assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances primarily include acquired loans loans that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral cost method and equity method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs a fair value measurement is determined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued new accounting standards                                                                                              see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting

may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on form 10k or elsewhere the following information should be read in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda the consolidated financial statements and related notes in consolidated financial statements and supplementary data and regulationrisk factors relating to regulation of this form 10k report our business routinely encounters and address risks some of which will cause our future results to be different sometimes materially different than we anticipate discussion about important operational risks that our business encounters can be found in the business descriptions in our business and the mda section of this form 10k report below we describe certain important strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks our reactions to material future developments as well as our competitors reactions to those developments will affect our future results macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition key macroeconomic conditions historically have affected our business results of operations and financial condition and are likely to affect them in the future consumer confidence unemployment and other economic indicators are among the factors that often impact consumer spending behavior and demand for credit poor economic conditions reduce the usage of our credit cards and other financing products and the average purchase amount of transactions on our credit cards and through our other products which in each case reduces our interest and fee income we rely primarily on interest and fees on our loan receivables to generate our net earnings our interest and fees on our loan receivables was billion for the year ended december poor economic conditions also adversely affect the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us increasing delinquencies bankruptcies charge offs and allowances for loan losses and decreasing recoveries for example our over30 day delinquency rate as a percentage of periodend loan receivables was at december during the financial crisis compared to at december and our fullyear net chargeoff rate was for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december the assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix account maturation as well as broader consumer trends such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness economic growth in the united states can slow due to higher unemployment rates lower housing values concerns about the level of us government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address this as well as economic and political conditions in the us and global markets a prolonged period of slow economic growth or a significant deterioration in economic conditions or broader consumer trends including wage growth savings rates and consumer indebtedness would likely affect consumer spending levels and the ability and willingness of customers to pay amounts owed to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business key credit trends results of operations and financial condition macroeconomic conditions may also cause net earnings to fluctuate and diverge from expectations of securities analysts and investors who may have differing assumptions regarding the impact of these conditions on our business and this may adversely impact our stock price our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners substantially all of our revenue is generated from the credit products we provide to customers of our partners pursuant to program agreements we enter into with our partners as a result our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners historically there has been turnover in our partners and we expect this will continue in the future for example in we announced that we would not be renewing our retail card program agreement with walmart program agreements with our retail card partners and national and regional retailer and manufacturer payment solutions partners typically are for multiyear terms these program agreements generally permit our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons including in some cases if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria we fail to achieve certain targets with respect to approvals of new customers as a result of the credit criteria we use we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds or we are not adequately capitalized or certain force majeure events or changes in our ownership occur or a material adverse change in our financial condition occurs a few payment solutions programs with national and regional retailer and manufacturer partners also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified notice to us eg several months in addition programs with manufacturers buying groups and industry associations generally are made available to payment solutions partners such as individual retail outlets dealers and merchants under dealer agreements which typically may be terminated at will by the partner on short notice to us eg days there is significant competition for our existing partners and our failure to retain our existing larger partner relationships upon the expiration or our earlier loss of a relationship upon the exercise of a partners early termination rights or the expiration or termination of a substantial number of smaller partner relationships could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including growth rates and financial condition to the extent we do not acquire new partners of similar size and profitability or otherwise grow our business in addition existing relationships may be renewed with less favorable terms to the company in response to increased competition for such relationships the competition for new partners is also significant and our failure to attract new partners could adversely affect our ability to grow a significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small number of retail card partners and the loss of any of these retail card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations based upon interest and fees on loans for the year ended december excluding the walmart program discussed above our five largest programs are gap jcpenney lowes paypal and sams club these programs accounted in aggregate for of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended december and of loan receivables at december our programs with lowes and paypal each accounted for more than of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended december see our businessour sales platformsretail card partners the program agreements generally permit us or our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date under various circumstances as described in the preceding risk factor some of our program agreements also provide that upon expiration or termination our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loans generated with respect to its program and all related customer data the loss of any of our largest partners or a material reduction in the interest and fees we receive from their customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition our business is heavily concentrated in us consumer credit and therefore our results are more susceptible to fluctuations in that market than a more diversified company our business is heavily concentrated in us consumer credit as a result we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks particular to us consumer credit than a more diversified company for example our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that affect the us economy consumer spending and consumer credit we are also more susceptible to the risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at consumer credit or the specific consumer credit products that we offer including promotional financing due to our carecredit platform we are also more susceptible to increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions targeted at healthcare related procedures or services in contrast to other industries our business concentration could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our results depend to a significant extent on the active and effective promotion and support of our products by our partners our partners generally accept most major credit cards and various other forms of payment and therefore our success depends on their active and effective promotion of our products to their customers we depend on our partners to integrate the use of our credit products into their store culture by training their sales associates about our products having their sales associates encourage their customers to apply for and use our products and otherwise effectively marketing our products in addition although our retail card programs and our payment solutions programs with national and regional retailer partners typically are exclusive with respect to the credit products we offer at that partner some payment solutions programs and most carecredit provider relationships are not exclusive to us and therefore a partner may choose to promote a competitors financing over ours depending upon cost availability or attractiveness to consumers or other factors typically we do not have or utilize any recourse against these nonexclusive partners when they do not sufficiently promote our products partners may also implement or fail to implement changes in their systems and technologies that may disrupt the integration between their systems and technologies and ours which could disrupt the use of our products the failure by our partners to effectively promote and support our products as well as changes they may make in their business models that negatively impact card usage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition if our partners engage in improper business practices do not adhere to the terms of our program agreements or other contractual arrangements or standards or otherwise diminish the value of our brand we may suffer reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations cyberattacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business in the normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential information regarding our partners and our customers we also have arrangements in place with our partners and other third parties through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and business continuity programs our facilities and systems and those of our partners and thirdparty service providers are vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events we and our partners and thirdparty service providers have experienced all of these events in the past and expect to continue to experience them in the future these events could interrupt our business or operations result in significant legal and financial exposure supervisory liability damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services although the impact to date from these events has not had a material adverse effect on us we cannot be sure this will be the case in the future information security risks for large financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies including mobile and other connected devices to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime perpetrators of fraud hackers terrorists and others in addition to cyberattacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions that are designed to disrupt key business services such as consumerfacing web sites our business performance and marketing efforts may increase our profile and therefore our risk of being targeted for cyberattacks and other security breaches including attacks targeting our key business services websites executives and partners we are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources we employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection we also face risks related to cyberattacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and deposit transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various thirdparties including our partners retailers that are not our partners where our dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards are used merchant acquiring banks payment processors card networks eg visa and mastercard and our processors eg first data and fiserv some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyberattacks and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure future security breaches or cyberattacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them we also rely on numerous other thirdparty service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them while we regularly conduct security assessments of significant thirdparty service providers we cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach the access by unauthorized persons to or the improper disclosure by us of confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary information software methodologies and business secrets could interrupt our business or operations result in significant legal and financial exposure supervisory liability damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition there have been a number of wellpublicized attacks or breaches directed at others in our industry that have heightened concern by consumers generally about the security of using credit cards which have caused some consumers including our customers to use our credit cards less in favor of alternative methods of payment and has led to increased regulatory focus on and potentially new regulations relating to these matters further cyberattacks or other breaches in the future whether affecting us or others could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of our cards and increased costs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions in the operation of our computer systems and data centers could have a material adverse effect on our business our ability to deliver products and services to our partners and our customers service our loans and otherwise operate our business and comply with applicable laws depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems and data centers as well as those of our partners and thirdparty service providers these computer systems and data centers may encounter service interruptions at any time due to system or software failure natural disaster or other reasons in addition the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain current and integrate new systems may also cause service interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause our failure to comply with applicable laws all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer credit industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies and business processes may be better than those we currently use the pace of technology change is high and our industry is intensely competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete and better ones become available a failure to maintain current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be less competitive all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our results are impacted to a significant extent by the financial performance of our partners our ability to generate new loans and the interest and fees and other income associated with them is dependent upon sales of merchandise and services by our partners the retail and healthcare industries in which our partners operate are intensely competitive our partners compete with retailers and department stores in their own geographic areas as well as catalog and internet sales businesses our partners in the healthcare industry compete with other healthcare providers our partners sales may decrease or may not increase as we anticipate for various reasons some of which are in the partners control and some of which are not for example partner sales may be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions having a national regional or more local effect on consumer spending business conditions affecting the general retail environment or a particular partner or industry or catastrophes affecting broad or more discrete geographic areas if our partners sales decline for any reason it generally results in lower credit sales and therefore lower loan volume and associated interest and fees and other income for us from their customers in addition if a partner closes some or all of its stores or becomes subject to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding or if there is a perception that it may become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding its customers who have used our financing products may have less incentive to pay their outstanding balances to us which could result in higher chargeoff rates than anticipated and our costs for servicing its customers accounts may increase this risk is particularly acute with respect to our largest partners that account for a significant amount of our interest and fees on loans see a significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small number of retail card partners and the loss of any of these retail card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations moreover if the financial condition of a partner deteriorates significantly or a partner becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding we may not be able to recover for customer returns customer payments made in partner stores or other amounts due to us from the partner a decrease in sales by our partners for any reason or a bankruptcy proceeding involving any of them could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to cover losses on our loans we maintain an allowance for loan losses a reserve established through a provision for losses charged to expense that we believe is appropriate at december to provide for incurred losses in our loan portfolio in addition for portfolios we may acquire when we enter into new partner program agreements any deterioration in the performance of the purchased portfolios after acquisition results in incremental loss reserves growth in our loan portfolio generally would lead to an increase in the allowance for loan losses the process for establishing an allowance for loan losses is critical to our results of operations and financial condition and requires complex models and judgments including forecasts of economic conditions in addition effective january the company will adopt asu financial instruments credit losses measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which requires us to adopt a new impairment model known as the cecl model the new model will require upon origination of a loan the recognition of all expected credit losses over the life of the loan based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding our loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses we may underestimate our expected losses and fail to maintain an allowance for credit losses sufficient to account for these losses in cases where we modify a loan if the modified loans do not perform as anticipated we may be required to establish additional allowances on these loans we will continue to periodically review and update our new methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to establish our allowance for credit losses to reflect our view of current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts moreover our regulators as part of their supervisory function periodically review our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use for calculating and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses our regulators based on their judgment may conclude that we should modify our current methodology models or the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments increase our allowance for credit losses andor recognize further losses we will implement further enhancements or changes to our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments as needed we cannot assure you that our loan loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses future increases in the allowance for credit losses or actual losses as a result of any review update regulatory guidance or otherwise will result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if assumptions or estimates we use in preparing our financial statements including those related to the new cecl accounting guidance effective for our company on january are incorrect or are required to change our reported results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected we are required to make various assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements under gaap including for purposes of determining asset impairment reserves related to litigation and other legal matters valuation of income and other taxes and regulatory exposures and the amounts recorded for certain contractual payments to be paid to or received from partners and others under contractual arrangements in addition significant assumptions and estimates are involved in determining certain disclosures required under gaap including those involving the fair value of our financial instruments if the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect the actual amounts realized on transactions and balances subject to those estimates will be different and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition following adoption of the new cecl accounting guidance on january we will be required to make various assumptions and estimates in determining allowances for credit losses under the cecl model the cecl model permits the use of judgment in determining an approach which is most appropriate for the company based on facts and circumstances we expect that the impact of adopting this new standard at the effective date will result in a material increase to the companys allowance for loan losses of approximately billion or and result in a decrease in regulatory capital amounts and ratios as a result of adoption once adopted upon origination of a loan the estimate of expected credit losses and any subsequent changes to such estimate will be recorded through provision for loan losses in our consolidated statement of earnings given the expected material increase to our allowance for credit losses under the new cecl guidance any subsequent changes we make to our underlying assumptions and estimates may result in a material adverse impact to our results of operations and the companys ability to return capital to our shareholders if our assumptions or estimates underlying our allowance for credit losses are incorrect or are required to change this could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimates and note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements adverse financial market conditions or our inability to effectively manage our funding and liquidity risk could have a material adverse effect on our funding liquidity and ability to meet our obligations we need to effectively manage our funding and liquidity in order to meet our cash requirements such as daytoday operating expenses extensions of credit to our customers payments of principal and interest on our borrowings and payments on our other obligations our primary sources of funding and liquidity are collections from our customers deposits funds from securitized financings and proceeds from unsecured borrowings if we do not have sufficient liquidity we may not be able to meet our obligations particularly during a liquidity stress event if we maintain or are required to maintain too much liquidity it could be costly and reduce our financial flexibility we will need additional financing in the future to refinance any existing debt and finance growth of our business the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as financial market conditions generally including the availability of credit to the financial services industry consumers willingness to place money on deposit in the bank our performance and credit ratings and the performance of our securitized portfolios disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital credit or deposit markets such as the uncertainty and volatility experienced in the capital and credit markets during periods of financial stress and other economic and political conditions in the global markets and concerning the level of us government debt and fiscal measures that may be taken over the longer term to address these matters may limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance maturing liabilities on desired terms including funding costs in a timely manner or at all as a result we may be forced to delay obtaining funding or be forced to issue or raise funding on undesirable terms which could significantly reduce our financial flexibility and cause us to contract or not grow our business all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions in addition at december we had an aggregate of billion of undrawn credit facilities subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under our securitization programs and an unsecured revolving credit facility our ability to draw on such commitments is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including the applicable securitization trust having sufficient collateral to support the draw and the absence of an early amortization event moreover there are regulatory reforms that have been proposed or adopted in the united states and internationally that are intended to address certain issues that affected banks in the last financial crisis these reforms generally referred to as basel iii subject banks to more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements to the extent that the basel iii requirements result in increased costs to the banks providing undrawn committed capacity under our securitization programs these costs are likely to be passed on to us in addition in response to basel iii some banks in the market including certain of the private lenders in our securitization programs have added provisions to their credit agreements permitting them to delay disbursement of funding requests for days or more if our bank lenders require delayed disbursements of funding andor higher pricing for committing undrawn capacity to us our cost of funding and access to liquidity could be adversely affected while financial market conditions are generally stable there can be no assurance that significant disruptions uncertainties and volatility will not occur in the future if we are unable to continue to finance our business access capital markets and attract deposits on favorable terms and in a timely manner or if we experience an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected our inability to grow our deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to grow our business we obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers or through brokerage firms that offer our deposit products to their customers at december we had billion in direct deposits and billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger who channels brokerage account deposits to us a key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to fund our growth through direct deposits the deposit business is highly competitive with intense competition in attracting and retaining deposits we compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits features and benefits of our products the quality of our customer service and the competitiveness of our digital banking capabilities our ability to originate and maintain retail deposits is also highly dependent on the strength of the bank and the perceptions of consumers and others of our business practices and our financial health adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to difficulties in attracting and retaining deposits accounts negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas including lending practices regulatory compliance inadequate protection of customer information or sales and marketing activities and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct the demand for the deposit products we offer may also be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns changes in customer preferences reductions in consumers disposable income regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of competing products competition from other financial services firms and others that use deposit funding products may affect deposit renewal rates costs or availability changes we make to the rates offered on our deposit products may affect our profitability and liquidity the federal deposit insurance act the fdia prohibits an insured bank from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the banks normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is well capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates there are no such restrictions under the fdia on a bank that is well capitalized and at december the bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well capitalized for purposes of the fdia however there can be no assurance that the bank will continue to meet those requirements limitations on the banks ability to accept brokered deposits for any reason including regulatory limitations on the amount of brokered deposits in total or as a percentage of total assets in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity any limitation on the interest rates the bank can pay on deposits could competitively disadvantage us in attracting and retaining deposits and have a material adverse effect on our business damage to our reputation could negatively impact our business maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining customers partners investors and employees in particular adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could also make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy of increasing retail deposits at the bank and may lead to decreases in deposits harm to our reputation can arise from many sources including employee misconduct misconduct by our partners outsourced service providers or other counterparties litigation or regulatory actions failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality inadequate protection of customer information and compliance failures negative publicity regarding us or others engaged in a similar business or activities whether or not accurate may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition a reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets synchronys senior unsecured debt currently is rated bbb stable outlook by fitch ratings inc fitch and bbb stable outlook by standard poors sp the banks senior unsecured debt currently is rated bbb stable outlook by fitch and bbb stable outlook by sp although we have not requested that moodys investor services inc moodys provide a rating for our senior unsecured debt we believe that if moodys were to issue a rating on our unsecured debt its rating would be lower than the comparable ratings issued by fitch and sp the ratings for our unsecured debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors that may not be within our control such as macroeconomic conditions and the rating agencies perception of the industries in which we operate and the products we offer the ratings of our assetbacked securities are and will continue to be based on a number of factors including the quality of the underlying loan receivables and the credit enhancement structure with respect to each series of assetbacked securities as well as our credit rating as sponsor and servicer of our publicly registered securitization trusts these ratings also reflect the various methodologies and assumptions used by the rating agencies which are subject to change and could adversely affect our ratings the rating agencies regularly evaluate our credit ratings as well as the credit ratings of our assetbacked securities a downgrade in our unsecured debt or assetbacked securities credit ratings or investor concerns that a downgrade may occur could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets if the ratings on our assetbacked securities are reduced put on negative watch or withdrawn it may have an adverse effect on the liquidity or the market price of our assetbacked securities and on the cost of or our ability to continue using securitized financings to the extent anticipated our inability to securitize our loan receivables would have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity cost of funds and financial condition we use the securitization of loan receivables which involves the transfer of loan receivables to a trust and the issuance by the trust of assetbacked securities to thirdparty investors as a significant source of funding our average level of securitized financings from third parties was billion and billion for the years ended december and respectively for a discussion of our securitization activities see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfunding liquidity and capital resourcesfunding sourcessecuritized financings and note variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the securitization market for credit cards will not experience future disruptions the extent to which we securitize our loan receivables in the future will depend in part upon the conditions in the securities markets in general and the credit card assetbacked securities market in particular the availability of loan receivables for securitization the overall credit quality of our loan receivables and the conformity of the loan receivables and our securitization program to rating agency requirements the costs of securitizing our loan receivables and the legal regulatory accounting and tax requirements governing securitization transactions in the event we are unable to refinance existing assetbacked securities with new assetbacked securities we would be required to rely on other sources of funding which may not be available or may be available only at higher cost further in the event we are unable to refinance existing assetbacked securities from our nonbank subsidiary securitization trust with new securities from the same trust there are structural and regulatory constraints on our ability to refinance these assetbacked securities with bank deposits or other funding at the bank and therefore we would be required to rely on sources outside of the bank which may not be available or may be available only at higher cost a prolonged inability to securitize our loan receivables on favorable terms or at all or to refinance our assetbacked securities would have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity cost of funds and financial condition the occurrence of an early amortization of our securitization facilities would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds our liquidity would be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of events resulting in the early amortization of our existing securitized financings during an early amortization period principal collections from the loan receivables in our assetbacked securitization trust in which the early amortization event occurred would be applied to repay principal of the trusts assetbacked securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund purchases of newly originated loan receivables this would negatively impact our liquidity including our ability to originate new loan receivables under existing accounts and require us to rely on alternative funding sources which might increase our funding costs or might not be available when needed our loss of the right to service or subservice our securitized loan receivables would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds synchrony currently acts as servicer with respect to our nonbank subsidiary securitization trust and the bank acts as servicer with respect to our other two securitization trusts if synchrony or the bank as applicable defaults in its servicing obligations an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant assetbacked securities andor synchrony or the bank as applicable could be replaced as servicer servicer defaults include for example the failure of the servicer to make any payment transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents a breach of representations warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents the delegation of the servicers duties contrary to the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer such an early amortization event would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor if either synchrony or the bank defaults in its servicing obligations with respect to any of our three securitization trusts a third party could be appointed as servicer of such trust if a thirdparty servicer is appointed there is no assurance that the third party will engage us as subservicer in which event we would no longer be able to control the manner in which the related trusts assets are serviced and the failure of a third party to appropriately service such assets could lead to an early amortization event in the affected securitization trust which would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor lower payment rates on our securitized loan receivables could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition certain collections from our securitized loan receivables come back to us through our subsidiaries and we use these collections to fund our purchase of newly originated loan receivables to collateralize our securitized financings if payment rates on our securitized loan receivables are lower than they have historically been fewer collections will be remitted to us on an ongoing basis further certain series of our assetbacked securities include a requirement that we accumulate principal collections in a restricted account for a specified number of months prior to the applicable securitys maturity date we are required under the program documents to lengthen this accumulation period to the extent we expect the payment rates to be low enough that the current length of the accumulation period is inadequate to fully fund the restricted account by the applicable securitys maturity date lower payment rates and in particular payment rates that are low enough that we are required to lengthen our accumulation periods could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings funding and liquidity changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease as certain of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks at december of our loan receivables were priced at a fixed interest rate to the customer with the remaining at a floating interest rate we fund our assets with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits assetbacked securities and unsecured debt the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is the prime rate and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either the libor or the federal funds rate the prime rate and libor or the federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities additionally on july the uk financial conduct authority announced that it would no longer encourage or compel banks to continue to contribute quotes and maintain libor after there is no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or of any particular replacement rate to the extent we are unable to position the balance sheet naturally or using derivatives to effectively match the interest rates on our assets and liabilities or are unable to effectively manage any transition from libor to a replacement rate or rates our net earnings could be materially adversely affected competitive and regulatory factors may limit our ability to raise interest rates on our loans in addition some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers if interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely manner or at all our net interest margin could be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings interest rates may also adversely impact our customers spending levels and ability and willingness to pay amounts owed to us our floating rate credit products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies bankruptcies chargeoffs allowances for loan losses and decreasing recoveries all of which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us and reductions in deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the net interest income impact of various interest rate scenarios we take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our net earnings and could also increase our funding costs and reduce our liquidity especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different from our assumptions for a discussion of interest rate risk sensitivities see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate risk our risk management processes and procedures may not be effective in mitigating our risks our risk management processes and procedures seek to appropriately balance risk and return and mitigate risks we have established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor and control the types of risk to which we are subject including credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk including compliance risk and strategic risk credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of an obligation we are exposed to both consumer credit risk from our customer loans and institutional credit risk principally from our partners market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet obligations and support business growth operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes people or systems external events ie natural disasters or compliance reputational or legal matters and includes those risks as they relate directly to us as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business strategic risk is the risk from changes in the business environment improper implementation of decisions or inadequate responsiveness to changes in the business environment see our businesscredit risk management and risksrisk management for additional information on the types of risks affecting our business we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework that includes our risk appetite statement enterprise risk assessment era process risk policies procedures and controls reporting requirements and corporate culture and values in conjunction with the risk management accountability incorporated into our integrated risk management framework which includes our governance structure and three distinct lines of defense management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models if the models that we use to manage these risks are ineffective at predicting future losses or are otherwise inadequate we may incur unexpected losses or otherwise be adversely affected in addition the information we use in managing our credit and other risk may be inaccurate or incomplete as a result of error or fraud both of which may be difficult to detect and avoid there may also be risks that exist or that develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated including when processes are changed or new products and services are introduced if our risk management framework does not effectively identify and control our risks we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected and that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business and if they are not accurate or are misinterpreted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business including liquidity and capital planning including stress testing customer selection credit and other risk management pricing reserving and collections management the models may prove in practice to be less predictive than we expect for a variety of reasons including as a result of errors in constructing interpreting or using the models or the use of inaccurate assumptions including failures to update assumptions appropriately or in a timely manner our assumptions may be inaccurate for many reasons including that they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and beyond our control eg macroeconomic conditions and their impact on partner and customer behaviors and they often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables factors and other assumptions the errors or inaccuracies in our models may be material and could lead us to make wrong or suboptimal decisions in managing our business and this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our business depends on our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and failing to do so may result in high chargeoff rates our success depends on our ability to manage our credit risk while attracting new customers with profitable usage patterns we select our customers manage their accounts and establish terms and credit limits using proprietary scoring models and other analytical techniques that are designed to set terms and credit limits to appropriately compensate us for the credit risk we accept while encouraging customers to use their available credit the models and approaches we use to manage our credit risk may not accurately predict future chargeoffs for various reasons discussed in the preceding risk factors our ability to manage credit risk and avoid high chargeoff rates also may be adversely affected by economic conditions that may be difficult to predict such as the last financial crisis the assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix account maturation as well as broader consumer trends such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness see managements discussion and analysisresults of operationsbusiness trends and conditions for further discussion of our expectations of future credit trends in the near term credit trends may deteriorate materially from our expectations if economic conditions were to deteriorate in addition we remain subject to conditions in the consumer credit environment our credit underwriting and risk management strategies are used to manage our credit exposures however there can be no assurance that those will enable us to avoid high chargeoff levels or delinquencies or that our allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to cover actual losses a customers ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders under mortgage credit card and other loans including student loans these changes can result from increases in base lending rates or structured increases in payment obligations and could reduce the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations to other lenders and to us in addition a customers ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by the restricted availability of credit to consumers generally including reduced and closed lines of credit customers with insufficient cash flow to fund daily living expenses and lack of access to other sources of credit may be more likely to increase their card usage and ultimately default on their payment obligations to us resulting in higher credit losses in our portfolio our collection operations may not compete effectively to secure more of customers diminished cash flow than our competitors we may not identify customers who are likely to default on their payment obligations to us and reduce our exposure by closing credit lines and restricting authorizations quickly enough which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition our collection strategy depends in part on the sale of debt to thirdparty buyers regulatory or other factors may adversely affect the pricing of our debt sales or the performance of our thirdparty buyers which may result in higher credit losses in our portfolio at december of our portfolios loan receivables were from customers with a fico score of or less excluding unrated accounts who typically have higher delinquency and credits losses than consumers with higher fico scores our ability to manage credit risk also may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations and collection regulations competitors actions and consumer behavior as well as inadequate collections staffing techniques models and performance of vendors such as collection agencies we may not be able to offset increases in our costs with decreased payments under our retailer share arrangements which could reduce our profitability most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the relevant program exceeds a contractually defined threshold although the share arrangements vary by partner these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program based typically on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for loan losses retailer payments and operating expenses and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold however because the threshold and the economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on among other things agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses we may not be able to pass on increases in our actual expenses such as funding costs or operating expenses in the form of reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements and our economic return on a program could be adversely affected while most of our agreements contain retailer share arrangements in some cases where we instead provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts for example on our cobranded credit cards our ability to offset increases in our costs is limited competition in the consumer finance industry is intense the success of our business depends on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners the competition for partners is intense and highly competitive our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as alliance data systems american express capital one jpmorgan chase citibank td bank and wells fargo and to a lesser extent financial technology companies and potential partners own inhouse financing capabilities some of our competitors are substantially larger have substantially greater resources and may offer a broader range of products and services we compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors including program financial and other terms underwriting standards marketing expertise service levels product and service offerings including incentive and loyalty programs technological capabilities and integration brand and reputation in addition some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting eg new account approval customer service and collections and other core banking responsibilities that we retain but some partners may prefer to handle as a result of competition we may be unable to acquire new partners lose existing relationships to competing companies or find it more costly to maintain our existing relationships our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain customers and generate usage of our products by them the consumer credit and payments industry is highly competitive and we face an increasingly dynamic industry as emerging technologies enter the marketplace as a form of payment our products compete with cash checks debit cards general purpose credit cards including visa and mastercard american express and discover card other private label card brands and to a certain extent prepaid cards in the future we expect our products may face increased competition from new emerging payment technologies such as apple pay android pay chase pay samsung pay and square to the extent that our products are not or do not continue to be accepted in or compatible with such technologies we may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry we compete for customers and their usage of our products and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers outstanding balances based on a number of factors including pricing interest rates and fees product offerings credit limits incentives including loyalty programs and customer service although we offer a variety of consumer credit products some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services including home and automobile loans debit cards and bank branch atm access which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may give those competitors advantages including a more diversified product and customer base the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers operational efficiencies more versatile technology platforms broadbased local distribution capabilities and lowercost funding in addition some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage customer attrition from any or all of our credit products or any lowering of the pricing of our products by reducing interest rates or fees in order to retain customers could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings in our retail deposits business we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct banking competitors we compete for deposits with traditional banks and in seeking to grow our direct banking business we compete with other banks that have direct banking models similar to ours such as ally financial american express capital one ing cit discover marcus by goldman sachs purepoint sallie mae and usaa competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors if we are unable to compete effectively for partners customer usage or deposits our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services our industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technologies products services and consumer preferences a key part of our financial success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services including with respect to loyalty programs mobile and point of sale technologies and new synchronybranded bank deposit and credit products realizing the benefits of those products and services is uncertain we may not assign the appropriate level of resources priority or expertise to the development and commercialization of these new products services or enhancements our ability to develop acquire or commercialize competitive technologies products or services on acceptable terms or at all may be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert in addition success is dependent on factors such as partner and customer acceptance adoption and usage competition the effectiveness of marketing programs the availability of appropriate technologies and business processes and regulatory approvals success of a new product service or enhancement also may depend upon our ability to deliver it on a large scale which may require a significant investment we also may select utilize and invest in technologies products and services that ultimately do not achieve widespread adoption and therefore are not as attractive or useful to our partners customers and service partners as we anticipate or partners may not recognize the value of our new products and services or believe they justify any potential costs or disruptions associated with implementing them in addition because our products and services typically are marketed through our partners if our partners are unwilling or unable to effectively implement our new technologies products services or enhancements we may be unable to grow our business competitors may also develop or adopt technologies or introduce innovations that change the markets we operate in and make our products less competitive and attractive to our partners and customers in any event we may not realize the benefit of new technologies products services or enhancements for many years or competitors may introduce more compelling products services or enhancements our failure to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products services or enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we may not realize the value of acquisitions and strategic investments that we pursue and such investments could divert resources or introduce unforeseen risks to our business we will acquire new partners and may execute strategic acquisitions or partnerships or make other strategic investments in businesses products technologies or platforms to enhance or grow our business these acquisitions and strategic investments may introduce new costs or liabilities which could impact our ability to grow or maintain acceptable performance we may be unable to integrate systems personnel or technologies from our acquisitions and strategic investments these acquisitions and strategic investments may also present unforeseen legal regulatory or other challenges that we may not be able to manage effectively the planning and integration of an acquisition including of a new partner or credit card portfolio partnership or investment may shift employee time and other resources which could impair our ability to focus on our core business new partnerships acquisitions and strategic investments may not perform as expected due to lack of acceptance by partners customers or employees higher than forecasted costs or losses lengthy transition periods synergies or savings not being realized and a variety of other factors this may result in a delay or unrealized benefit or in some cases increased costs or other unforeseen risks to our business reductions in interchange fees may reduce the competitive advantages our private label credit card products currently have by virtue of not charging interchange fees and would reduce our income from those fees interchange is a fee merchants pay to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the networks infrastructure and payment facilitation and which are paid to credit card issuers to compensate them for the risk they bear in lending money to customers we earn interchange fees on dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card transactions but we typically do not charge or earn interchange fees from our partners or customers on our private label credit card products merchants trying to decrease their operating expenses have sought to and have had some success at lowering interchange rates several recent events and actions indicate a continuing increase in focus on interchange by both regulators and merchants beyond pursuing litigation legislation and regulation merchants are also pursuing alternate payment platforms as a means to lower payment processing costs to the extent interchange fees are reduced one of our current competitive advantages with our partnersthat we typically do not charge interchange fees when our private label credit card products are used to purchase our partners goods and servicesmay be reduced moreover to the extent interchange fees are reduced our income from those fees will be lower we received million of interchange fees for the year ended december as a result a reduction in interchange fees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition for our dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards we are subject to the operating regulations and procedures set forth by the interchange network and our failure to comply with these operating regulations which may change from time to time could subject us to various penalties or fees or the termination of our license to use the interchange network all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations fraudulent activity associated with our products and services could negatively impact our operating results brand and reputation and cause the use of our products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase we are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with partners customers and third parties handling customer information our fraudrelated operational losses were million million and million for the years ended december and respectively our fraudrelated losses have shifted away from counterfeit fraud losses with the implementation of the emv chip in dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards and towards application and transactional fraud our products are susceptible to application fraud because among other things we provide immediate access to the credit line at the time of approval in addition sales on the internet and through mobile channels are becoming a larger part of our business and fraudulent activity is higher as a percentage of sales in those channels than in stores dual cards general purpose cobranded credit cards and private label credit cards are susceptible to different types of fraud and depending on our product channel mix including as a result of the introduction if any of a synchronybranded general purpose credit card we may continue to experience variations in or levels of fraudrelated expense that are different from or higher than that experienced by some of our competitors or the industry generally the risk of fraud continues to increase for the financial services industry in general and credit card fraud identity theft and related crimes are likely to continue to be prevalent and perpetrators are growing more sophisticated our resources technologies and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud high profile fraudulent activity also could negatively impact our brand and reputation which could negatively impact the use of our cards and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention such as increased customer notification requirements which could increase our costs and also negatively impact our operating results brand and reputation and could lead us to take steps to reduce fraud risk which could increase our costs the failure of third parties to provide various services that are important to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations some services important to our business are outsourced to thirdparty vendors for example our credit card transaction processing production and related services including the printing and mailing of customer statements are handled by first data and the technology platform for our online retail deposits is managed by fiserv first data fiserv and in some cases other thirdparty vendors are the sole source or one of a limited number of sources of the services they provide for us in fiserv acquired first data it would be difficult and disruptive for us to replace some of our thirdparty vendors particularly first data and fiserv in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future as a result of their financial or business conditions or otherwise and our business and operations likely would be materially adversely affected our principal agreement with first data expires in november unless it is terminated earlier or is extended pursuant to the terms thereof our principal agreement with fiserv expires in july unless it is terminated earlier or is extended pursuant to the terms thereof in addition if a thirdparty provider fails to provide the services we require fails to meet contractual requirements such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations or suffers a cyberattack or other security breach our business could suffer economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we have international operations that subject us to various international risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs we have international operations primarily in india the philippines and canada and some of our thirdparty service providers provide services to us from other countries all of which subject us to a number of international risks including among other things sovereign volatility and sociopolitical instability for example the philippines has in the past experienced severe political and social instability any future political or social instability in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business operations us regulations also govern various aspects of the international activities of domestic corporations and increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs any failure on our part or the part of our service providers to comply with applicable us regulations as well as the regulations in the countries and markets in which we or they operate could result in fines penalties injunctions or other similar restrictions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we are alleged to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights owned by others or are not able to protect our intellectual property our business and results of operations could be adversely affected competitors or other third parties may allege that we or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us infringe on their intellectual property rights we also may face allegations that our employees have misappropriated intellectual property of their former employers or other third parties given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual propertyrelated litigation an assertion of an infringement claim against us may cause us to spend significant amounts to defend the claim even if we ultimately prevail pay significant money damages lose significant revenues be prohibited from using the relevant systems processes technologies or other intellectual property cease offering certain products or services or incur significant license royalty or technology development expenses moreover it has become common in recent years for individuals and groups to purchase intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees in addition although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify us for such costs such indemnifying party may refuse or be unable to uphold its contractual obligations moreover we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information including copyrights trademarks patents trade secrets and controls on access and distribution these measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage and in any event we may be required to litigate to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information from misappropriation or infringement by others which is expensive could cause a diversion of resources and may not be successful third parties may challenge invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property or our intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages our competitors or other third parties may independently design around or develop similar technology or otherwise duplicate our services or products such that we could not assert our intellectual property rights against them in addition our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of an unauthorized disclosure litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses our business is subject to increased risks of litigation and regulatory actions as a result of a number of factors and from various sources including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry and the structure of the credit card industry in the normal course of business from time to time we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business activities certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in addition while historically the arbitration provision in our customer agreements generally has limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future there may also be legislative or other efforts to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of predispute arbitration clauses or we may be compelled as a result of competitive pressure or reputational concerns to voluntarily eliminate predispute arbitration clauses if the arbitration provision is not enforceable or eliminated for whatever reason our exposure to class action litigation could increase significantly we are also involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental agencies regarding our business collectively regulatory matters which could subject us to significant fines penalties obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses diminished earnings and damage to our reputation the current environment of additional regulation increased regulatory compliance efforts and enhanced regulatory enforcement has resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may prevent or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services there is no assurance that these regulatory matters or other factors will not in the future affect how we conduct our business and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we contest liability andor the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter the outcome of pending and future matters could be material to our results of operations financial condition and cash flows depending on among other factors the level of our earnings for that period and could adversely affect our business and reputation for a discussion of certain legal proceedings see regulationconsumer financial services regulation and note legal proceedings and regulatory matters to our consolidated financial statements in addition to litigation and regulatory matters from time to time through our operational and compliance controls we identify compliance issues that require us to make operational changes and depending on the nature of the issue result in financial remediation to impacted cardholders these selfidentified issues and voluntary remediation payments could be significant depending on the issue and the number of cardholders impacted they also could generate litigation or regulatory investigations that subject us to additional adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and motivate key officers and employees our success depends in large part on our ability to retain recruit and motivate key officers and employees our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for senior executives in the financial services and payment industry is intense we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel guidelines issued by the federal banking regulators prohibits our payment of excessive compensation or compensation that could lead to our material financial loss to our executives employees and directors in addition proposed rules implementing the executive compensation provisions of the doddfrank act would limit the type and structure of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our senior executives and persons deemed significant risktakers these restrictions could negatively impact our ability to compete with other companies in recruiting retaining and motivating key personnel failure to retain talented senior leadership could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we operate in multiple jurisdictions and we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions from time to time legislative initiatives may be proposed such as the tax act which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our deferred tax assets tax positions andor our tax liabilities in addition us federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our historical tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in defending our positions in connection with any such challenge in addition there is still some uncertainty around the interpretation of certain provisions of the recent us tax reform while the tax act had a significant positive impact on our aftertax results technical corrections or other forthcoming guidance could change how we interpret provisions of it which may impact our effective tax rate and could affect our deferred tax assets tax positions andor our tax liabilities state sales tax rules and regulations and their application and interpretation by the respective states could change and adversely affect our results of operations state sales tax rules and regulations and their application and interpretation by the respective states could adversely affect our results of operations retailers collect sales tax from retail customers and remit those collections to the applicable states when customers fail to repay their loans including the amount of sales tax advanced by us to the merchant on their behalf we are entitled in some cases to seek a refund of the amount of sales tax from the applicable state sales tax laws and regulations enacted by the various states are subject to interpretation and our compliance with such laws is routinely subject to audit and review by the states audit risk is concentrated in several states and these states are conducting ongoing audits the outcomes of ongoing and any future audits and changes in the states interpretation of the sales tax laws and regulations involving the recovery of tax on bad debts could materially adversely impact our results of operations we could have a material indemnification obligation to ge under the tssa if we cause the splitoff from ge or certain preliminary transactions to fail to qualify for taxfree treatment or in the case of certain significant transfers of our stock following the splitoff from ge ge completed its exit from its investment in us in an exchange offer that concluded in november resulting in our splitoff from ge the splitoff was designed to qualify for taxfree treatment to ge and its shareholders under section of the internal revenue code of as amended the code ge obtained a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs regarding certain issues relating to the tax free treatment of the splitoff and a series of preliminary transactions that occurred prior to implementing the exchange offer although the irs private letter ruling is generally binding on the irs the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the irs private letter ruling the irs private letter ruling addresses only certain aspects of the transaction as a result ge obtained an opinion from tax counsel confirming the taxfree treatment of the splitoff the opinion is based upon various factual representations and assumptions as well as certain undertakings made by us and ge if any of those factual representations or assumptions in the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion are untrue or incomplete in any material respect any undertaking is not complied with or the facts upon which the irs private letter ruling or tax opinion was based are materially different from the facts at the time of the distribution the splitoff may not qualify for tax free treatment opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs as a result the conclusions expressed in the opinion of counsel could be challenged by the irs and if the irs prevails in such challenge the tax consequences of the splitoff could be materially less favorable if the splitoff or any of the preliminary transactions is determined to be taxable ge and its shareholders could incur significant tax liabilities and under the tssa we entered into with ge we may be required to indemnify ge for any liabilities incurred by ge if the liabilities are caused by any action or inaction undertaken by us following the initial public offering of our common stock ipo in or as a result of any direct or indirect transfers of our stock following the exchange offer in order to preserve the taxfree status of the splitoff and the preliminary transactions to ge the tssa includes a provision generally prohibiting us from taking any action or inaction that is within our control other than actions or inactions that implemented the splitoff or certain preliminary transactions or actions or inactions that are consented to by ge or are at the direction of ge that would cause the splitoff or the preliminary transactions to become taxable and providing for an indemnity obligation from us to ge for tax liabilities incurred by ge as a result of a breach of these provisions by us or as a result of any direct or indirect transfers of our stock following the exchange offer see regulationrisk factors relating to regulation on page

and we have developed processes to manage the major categories of risk namely credit market liquidity operational including compliance strategic risk and reputational risk considered across all risk types as described in greater detail below under risk management roles and responsibilities we manage enterprise risk using an integrated framework that includes boardlevel oversight administration by a group of crossfunctional management committees and daytoday implementation by a dedicated risk management team led by the chief risk officer cro we also utilize the three lines of defense risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk the risk committee of the board of directors has responsibility for the oversight of the risk management program and three other board committees have other oversight roles with respect to risk management several management committees and subcommittees have important roles and responsibilities in administering the risk management program including the enterprise risk management committee the ermc the management committee the mc the asset and liability management committee the alco and the capital management committee the cmc this committeefocused governance structure provides a forum through which risk expertise is applied cross functionally to all major decisions including development of policies processes and controls used by the cro and risk management team to execute the risk management philosophy the enterprise risk management philosophy is to ensure that all relevant risks are appropriately identified measured monitored and controlled the approach in executing this philosophy focuses on leveraging risk expertise to drive enterprise risk management using a strong governance framework structure a comprehensive enterprise risk assessment program and an effective risk appetite framework risk categories risk management is organized around six major risk categories credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk including compliance strategic risk and reputational risk we evaluate the potential impact of a risk event on us including subsidiaries by assessing the partner and customer financial reputational and legal and regulatory impacts credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of a contract andor the underlying collateral is insufficient to satisfy the obligation credit risk includes exposure to consumer credit risk from customer loans as well as institutional credit risk principally from our partners consumer credit risk is one of our most significant risks see our businesscredit risk management for a description of the customer credit risk management procedures market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio the principal market risk exposures arise from volatility in interest rates and their impact on economic value capitalization levels and earnings market risk is managed by the alco and is subject to policy and risk appetite limits on sensitivity of both earnings at risk and the economic value of equity market risk metrics are reviewed by alco monthly the risk committee on a quarterly basis and the board of directors as required liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that an institutions financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by a real or perceived inability to meet contractual obligations and support planned growth the primary liquidity objective is to maintain a liquidity profile that will enable us even in times of stress or market disruption to fund our existing assets and meet liabilities in a timely manner and at an acceptable cost policy and risk appetite limits require us and the bank and other entities within our business as applicable to ensure that sufficient liquid assets are available to survive liquidity stresses over a specified time period our risk appetite statement requires funding diversification monitoring early warning indicators in the capital markets and other related limits alco reviews liquidity exposures continuously in the context of approved policy and risk appetite limits and reports results quarterly to the risk committee and the board of directors as required operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes people or systems external events ie natural disasters or compliance reputational or legal matters and includes any of those risks as they relate directly to us and our subsidiaries as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws rules regulations and internal policies and procedures operational risk also includes model risk relating to various financial and other models used by us and our subsidiaries including the bank and is subject to a formal governance process
