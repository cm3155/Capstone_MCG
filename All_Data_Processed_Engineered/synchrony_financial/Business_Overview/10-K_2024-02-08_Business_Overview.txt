programs for our retail and digital partners are typically governed by program agreements that are each negotiated separately with our partners although the terms of the agreements are partnerspecific and may be amended from time to time under a typical program agreement our partner agrees to support and promote the program to its customers but we control credit criteria and issue products to customers who qualify under those criteria we own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination other key provisions in our program agreements include term our program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately three to ten years many program agreements have renewal clauses that provide for automatic renewal for one or more years until terminated by us or our partner we typically seek to renew the program agreements well in advance of their termination dates some program agreements are subject to termination prior to the scheduled termination date by us or our partner for various reasons see termination below for additional information exclusivity our program agreements are typically exclusive for the products we offer and limit our partners ability to originate or promote other private label or cobranded credit cards during the term of the agreement the terms of our program agreements with national and regional retailers and manufacturers are typically similar to the terms of our program agreements in that we are the exclusive provider of financing for the products we offer or in the case of some of our programs may allow to have several primary lenders some program agreements however allow the merchant to use a second source lender after an application has been submitted to us and declined retailer share arrangements most of our program agreements with large retail and certain other partners contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractuallydefined threshold economic performance for the purposes of these arrangements is typically measured based on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for credit losses retailer payments and operating expenses we may also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements for example on our cobranded credit cards

use of our product such as opportunities to receive double rewards points for purchases made on a product and the allocation of costs related to the rewards program termination the program agreements set forth the circumstances in which a party may terminate the agreement prior to expiration our program agreements generally permit us and our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons including if the other party materially breaches its obligations some program agreements also permit our partner to terminate the program if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria we fail to achieve certain approval rate targets with respect to approvals of new customers we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds we are not adequately capitalized certain force majeure events occur or certain changes in our ownership occur certain program agreements are also subject to early termination by a party if the other party has a material adverse change in its financial condition historically these rights have not typically been triggered or exercised some of our program agreements provide that upon termination or expiration our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loan receivables generated with respect to its program at fair market value or a stated price including all related customer data buying groups manufacturers and industry associations the programs

by program agreements under which we make our credit products available to their respective members or dealers these arrangements may include signup fees and volumebased incentives paid by us to the groups and their members but these agreements generally do not require the members or dealers to offer our products to their customers under the terms of the program agreements buying groups manufacturers and industry associations generally agree to support and promote the respective programs synchronybranded networks our synchronybranded networks are focused on specific industries where

arising from credit products is generally highly diversified across approximately million open accounts at december without significant individual exposures we manage credit risk primarily according to customer segments and product types we have developed proprietary credit tools which we call synchrony prism through synchrony prism we leverage a broad spectrum of data to yield powerful proprietary insights to enable a more holistic view of our applications and customers customer account acquisition we have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and apply a consistent underwriting approach using our synchrony prism tools that have varying results across our client portfolios based on the underlying credit characteristics of their customer base and applicant pool we originate credit accounts through several different channels including instore mail internet mobile telephone and preapproved solicitations in addition we have and may in the future acquire accounts that were originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners regardless of the channel in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit we follow a series of credit and fraud underwriting procedures in most cases when applications are made instore or digitally the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of our credit decision immediately we obtain certain information provided by the applicant leverage historical performance on other synchrony accounts where applicable as well as partner data on the consumer and obtain a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus the credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary scoring models developed to assess credit worthiness the credit risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit worthiness and initial credit line assignments for applicants for each portfolio and product type we periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to projected performance and adjustments to the minimum credit worthiness or the opening credit limit to manage credit risk are made as necessary we also apply additional application screens based on various inputs including credit bureau information alternative data our previous experience with the customer and information provided by our partner to help identify additional factors such as potential fraud and prior bankruptcies before qualifying the application for approval we compare applicants names against the specially designated nationals list maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury ofac as well as screens that account for adherence to usa patriot act of the patriot act and credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the card act requirements including ability to pay requirements for our revolving products we also use preapproved account solicitations for certain programs potential applicants are prescreened using information provided by our partner or obtained from outside lists and qualified individuals receive a preapproved credit offer by mail or email acquired portfolio evaluation our risk management team evaluates each portfolio that we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies our credit risk guidelines as part of this review we receive data on the thirdparty accounts and loans which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain core characteristics such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information in addition we benchmark potential portfolio acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks finally our risk management team must approve the acquisition taking into account the results of our risk assessment process once assets are migrated to our systems our account management protocols will apply immediately as described below under customer account management credit authorizations of individual transactions and collections customer account management we regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts this ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customers performance with respect to their account with us as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customers broader credit performance to monitor and control the quality of our loan portfolio including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to score each active account on its monthly cycle date proprietary risk models together with the credit scores obtained on each active account no less than quarterly are an integral part of our credit decisionmaking process depending on the duration of the customers account usage risk profile and other performance metrics the account may be subject to a range of account actions including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits as applicable credit authorizations of individual transactions once an account is opened subsequent transactions by customers with revolving cards via physical purchase terminals or online methods are subject to our credit authorization system each potential sales transaction is passed through our authorization system which considers a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be approved or declined and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted fraud investigation we provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings new account fraud and transactional fraud we have developed proprietary fraud models to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customers established pattern our proprietary models are also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our customers we also are continuously implementing new and improved fraud and authentication technologies to prevent detect and mitigate fraud collections and recovery all monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts collections personnel generally initiate contact with customers within days after any portion of their balance becomes past due the nature and the timing of the initial contact typically a personal call email text message or letter are determined by a review of the customers prior account activity and payment habits we reevaluate our collection and recovery efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques including internal collection activities use of external vendors and the sale of debt to thirdparty buyers as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent we limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the transaction authorization processes the imposition of credit limits and criteriabased account suspension and revocation processes in certain situations we may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules decrease interest rates andor waive fees to aid customers experiencing financial difficulties in their efforts to become current on their

holistically for assessing the portfolio credit loss content we also evaluate portfolio risk management techniques applied to various accounts historical behavior of different account vintages account seasoning economic conditions recent trends in delinquencies account collection management forecasting uncertainties expectations about the future and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses we estimate our allowance for credit losses using pools of loans with similar risk characteristics further experience is not available for new portfolios therefore while we accumulate experience we utilize our experience with the most closely analogous products and segments in our portfolio the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current and forecasted conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process which can result in changes to our assumptions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for credit losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period primarily consists of investments in debt securities assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances primarily include acquired loans loans that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale equity method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired as well as certain equity securities without readily determinable fair value that are measured based upon observable price changes our disposition of pets best and acquisition of ally lending are expected to close in the first quarter of subject to customary closing conditions these transactions will also be subject to fair value measurements related to both the consideration to be received at the closing of the sale of pets best and the assets and liabilities acquired at the closing of the acquisition of ally lending a fair value measurement is determined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs risks risk factors summary

a credible plan the institution could become subject to an enforcement action we are evaluating the impact of this proposal heightened standards for risk management governance the occs heightened standards establish guidelines for the governance and risk management practices of large occregulated institutions including the bank these heightened standards require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risktaking activities provide standards for covered banks boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework and describe the appropriate risk management roles and responsibilities of front line units independent risk management and internal audit functions the bank believes it complies with the heightened standards consumer financial services regulation the relationship between us and our us customers is regulated under federal and state consumer protection laws federal laws include the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act hola the fair credit reporting act the fcra the grammleachbliley act the glba the card act and the doddfrank act these and other federal laws among other things require disclosures of the cost of credit provide substantive consumer rights prohibit discrimination in credit transactions regulate the use of credit report information provide financial privacy protections require safe and sound banking operations prohibit unfair deceptive and abusive practices restrict our ability to raise interest rates on certain credit card balances and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight state and in some cases local laws also may regulate the relationship between us and our us customers in these areas as well as in the areas of collection practices and may provide additional consumer protections moreover we are subject to the servicemembers civil relief act which protects persons called to active military service and their dependents from undue hardship resulting from their military service and the military lending act the mla which extends specific protections if an account holder at the time of account opening is a covered active duty member of the military or certain family members thereof the servicemembers civil relief act applies to all debts incurred prior to the commencement of active duty including credit card and other openend debt and limits the amount of interest including service and renewal charges and any other fees or charges other than bona fide insurance that are related to the obligation or liability the mla applies to certain consumer loans including credit extended pursuant to a credit card account and extends specific protections if an account holder at the time of account opening is a covered active duty member of the military or certain family members thereof collectively the covered borrowers these protections include but are not limited to a limit on the military annual percentage rate that can be charged to delivery of certain required disclosures and a prohibition on mandatory arbitration agreements if we were to extend credit to a covered borrower without complying with certain mla provisions the credit card agreement could be void from its inception violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers including actual damages restitution and attorneys fees federal banking regulators as well as state attorneys general and other state and local consumer protection agencies also may seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies including civil money penalties and fines the card act which was enacted in amended the truth in lending act and required us to make significant changes to many of our business practices including marketing underwriting pricing and billing the card acts restrictions on our ability to increase interest rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions and credit risk ultimately limits our ability to extend credit to new customers and provide additional credit to current customers other card act restrictions such as limitations on late fees have resulted and will continue to result in reduced interest income and loan fee income on february the cfpb issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which if adopted likely would result in a significant reduction of credit card late fees assessed by credit card issuers and may adversely impact our earnings see risk factors relating to our business the cfpbs proposed rule on credit card late fees if adopted could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations the fcra regulates our use of credit reports and the reporting of information to credit reporting agencies and also provides a standard for lenders to share information with affiliates and certain third parties and to provide firm offers of credit to consumers the fcra also places further restrictions on the use of information shared between affiliates for marketing purposes requires the provision of disclosures to consumers when riskbased pricing is used in a credit decision and requires safeguards to help protect consumers from identity theft under hola the bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers in general the bank may not extend credit lease or sell property or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that i the customer obtain or provide some additional credit property or services from or to the bank or synchrony or their subsidiaries or ii the customer may not obtain some other credit property or services from a competitor except in each case to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended certain arrangements are permissible for example the bank may offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products the doddfrank act established the cfpb which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers the cfpb is authorized to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair transparent and competitive the cfpb has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the doddfrank act and other federal consumer financial services laws as well as broad supervisory examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services such as us in addition the cfpb has an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the products we offer the system could inform future agency decisions with respect to regulatory enforcement or examination focus there continues to be uncertainty as to how the cfpbs strategies and priorities will impact our business and our results of operations going forward see regulationrisk factors relating to regulationthere continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureaus actions will impact our business the agencys actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business privacy information security and data protection we are subject to various privacy information security and data protection laws including requirements concerning security breach notification for example in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to the glba and implementing regulations and guidance among other things the glba i imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties ii requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to opt out of the institutions disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties with certain exceptions and iii requires financial institutions to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institutions size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institutions activities the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches federal and state laws also require us to respond appropriately to data security breaches a final rule that the federal banking agencies issued in november requires banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator of significant computer security incidents within hours of determining that such an incident has occurred in the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act ccpa the ccpa requires covered businesses to comply with requirements that give consumers the right to know what information is being collected from them and whether such information is sold or disclosed to third parties the statute also allows consumers to access delete and prevent the sale of personal information that has been collected by covered businesses in certain circumstances the ccpa does not apply to personal information collected processed sold or disclosed pursuant to the glba or the california financial information privacy act we believe we are a covered business under the ccpa we have a program to comply with applicable privacy information security and data protection requirements imposed by federal state and foreign laws however if we experience a significant cybersecurity incident or our regulators deemed our information security controls to be inadequate we could be subject to supervisory criticism or penalties andor suffer reputational harm see also regulationrisk factors relating to regulationregulations relating to privacy information

affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel as a savings and loan holding company and financial holding company synchrony is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as a large provider of consumer financial services we are also subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb the bank is a federally chartered savings association as such the bank is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ which is its primary regulator and by the cfpb in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is supervised by the fdic we including the bank are regularly reviewed and examined by our respective regulators which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require response and attention see regulation for more information about the regulations applicable to us banking laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect consumers federally insured deposits the dif and the banking system as a whole and not intended to protect our stockholders noteholders or creditors if we or our service providers including our partners fail to satisfy applicable laws and regulations our respective regulators have broad discretion to enforce those laws and regulations including with respect to the operation of our business required capital levels payment of dividends and other capital distributions engaging in certain activities and making acquisitions and investments our regulators also have broad discretion with respect to the manner in which they enforce applicable laws and regulations including through enforcement actions that could subject us to civil money penalties customer remediation programs increased compliance costs and limits or prohibitions on our ability to offer certain products and services or to engage in certain activities in addition to the extent we undertake actions requiring regulatory approval or nonobjection our regulators may make their approval or nonobjection subject to conditions or restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition any other actions taken by our regulators could have a material adverse impact on our business reputation and brand results of operations and financial condition moreover some of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less restrictive statutory andor regulatory regimes which may have the effect of providing them with a competitive advantage over us new laws regulations policies or practical changes in enforcement of existing laws regulations or policies applicable to our business or our own reexamination of our current practices could adversely impact our profitability limit our ability to continue existing or pursue new business activities or acquisitions require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with customers affect retention of our key personnel affect how we interact with our partners andor service providers or expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs andor customer remediation these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for example the cfpb has broad authority over our business and there continues to be uncertainty as to how the cfpbs actions will impact our business see there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureaus actions will impact our business the agencys actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business we are also subject to potential enforcement and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties and fines customer remediation programs and increased compliance costs as well as damage our reputation and brand and limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices for a discussion of risks related to actions or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies see risk factors relating to our businesslitigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses ongoing changes to the regulatory framework applicable to us have had and may continue to have a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations ongoing changes to the regulatory framework applicable to us have had and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition for example the doddfrank act and related regulations restrict certain business practices impose stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements as well as additional costs including increased compliance costs and increased costs of funding raised through the issuance of assetbacked securities on us and impact the value of our assets in addition the doddfrank act requires us to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution we control such as the bank such support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interest of synchrony or its stockholders noteholders or creditors we describe certain provisions of the doddfrank act and other legislative and regulatory developments in regulationregulation relating to our business the egrrcpa and related regulatory reform initiatives modified many of the doddfrank acts requirements including provisions in the tailoring rules that apply certain enhanced prudential standards to covered savings and loan holding companies as a result because we had average total consolidated assets of billion or more based on a four quarter average as of march following applicable transition periods we will become subject to biennial supervisory stress tests formal capital plan submission requirements and the stress capital buffer which will impose additional requirements and constraints on us additional rulemaking may impose new capital requirements and limitations on our ability to pay dividends or redeem or repurchase our stock increase liquidity requirements require changes to our funding strategy andor increase our funding and operating costs such additional rulemaking includes an existing rule proposal to change the regulatory capital requirements for us banking organizations with at least billion in total assets and an existing proposal to require depository institution holding companies with billion or more in assets to issue minimum amounts of longterm debt and maintain clean holding companies see regulationregulation relating to our businesssavings and loan holding company regulationcapital and regulationregulation relating to our businesssavings and loan holding company regulationresolution further the recent and possible future changes to the regulatory framework applicable to synchrony and the bank and any potential additional rulemaking make it difficult to assess the overall financial impact of the doddfrank act and related regulatory developments on us and across the industry there is ongoing uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureaus actions will impact our business the agencys actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business the cfpb has broad authority over our business this includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions such as us for compliance the cfpb is authorized to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices through its regulatory supervisory and enforcement authority the federal reserve board and the occ and state government agencies may also invoke their supervisory and enforcement authorities to prevent unfair and deceptive acts or practices these federal and state agencies are authorized to remediate violations of consumer protection laws in a number of ways including collecting civil money penalties and fines and providing for customer restitution the cfpb also engages in consumer financial education requests data and promotes the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities in addition the cfpb maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the products we offer this system could inform future cfpb decisions with respect to its regulatory enforcement or examination focus there is ongoing uncertainty as to how the cfpbs strategies and priorities including in both its examination and enforcement processes will impact our business and our results of operations going forward actions by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services including deferred interest products making them less attractive to consumers and less profitable to us and also restricting our ability to offer them in addition since the bank has entered into two consent orders with the cfpb one in which has since been terminated and another in with respect to a debt cancellation product and sales practices and an unrelated issue that arose from the banks selfidentified omission of certain spanishspeaking customers and customers residing in puerto rico from two offers that were made to certain delinquent customers the banks resolutions with the cfpb do not preclude other regulators or state attorneys general from seeking additional monetary or injunctive relief with respect to these or other issues and any such relief could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition although we have committed significant resources to enhancing our compliance programs changes by the cfpb in regulatory expectations interpretations or practices or interpretations that are different or stricter than ours or those adopted in the past by the cfpb or other regulators could increase the risk of additional enforcement actions fines and penalties most recently the cfpb has identified certain areas of concern for consumers including for example the increasing sophistication of underwriting fair lending concerns including in marketing debt collection excessive andor unexpected fees and medical debt actions by the cfpb with respect to these or other areas could result in requirements to alter our products and services that may make them less attractive to consumers or less profitable to us for example on february the cfpb issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which if adopted likely would result in a significant reduction of credit card late fees assessed by credit card issuers for a discussion of risks related to the cfpbs proposed late fee rule please see risk factors relating to our businessthe cfpbs proposed rule on credit card late fees if adopted could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations additionally on july the cfpb together with the us department of health and human services and the us department of the treasury issued a request for information soliciting public comment on medical credit cards loans and other financial products used to pay for health care which may lead to additional regulatory supervisory or enforcement activity regarding these products future actions by the cfpb or other regulators against us or our competitors that discourage the use of products we offer or suggest to consumers the desirability of other products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of customers if the cfpb changes regulations which it adopted in the past or which were adopted in the past by other regulators and transferred to the cfpb by the doddfrank act or modifies through supervision or enforcement past related regulatory guidance or interprets existing regulations in a different or stricter manner than they have been interpreted in the past by us the industry or other regulators our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially if future regulatory or legislative restrictions or prohibitions are imposed that affect our ability to offer promotional financing including deferred interest for certain of our products or require us to make significant changes to our business practices and we are unable to develop compliant alternatives with acceptable returns these restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition the doddfrank act authorizes state officials to enforce regulations issued by the cfpb and to enforce the acts general prohibition against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices this could make it more difficult than in the past for federal financial regulators to declare state laws that differ from federal standards to be preempted to the extent that states enact requirements that differ from federal standards or state officials and courts adopt interpretations of federal consumer laws that differ from those adopted by the cfpb we may be required to alter or cease offering products or services in some jurisdictions which would increase compliance costs and reduce our ability to offer the same products and services to consumers nationwide and we may be subject to a higher risk of state enforcement actions failure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us synchrony and the bank must meet rules for capital adequacy as discussed in regulationregulation relating to our business as a standalone savings and loan holding company synchrony is subject to capital requirements similar to those that apply to the bank synchrony and the bank may be subject to increasingly stringent capital adequacy standards in the future for instance because synchrony had as of march billion or more in average total consolidated assets based on a four quarter average synchrony will become subject to biennial supervisory stress tests a formal capital plan submission requirement and the stress capital buffer following applicable transition periods see regulationregulation relating to our business savings and loan holding company regulationcapital and regulationregulation relating to our business savings and loan holding company regulationdividends and stock repurchases once synchrony becomes subject to supervisory stress tests a formal capital plan submission requirement andor the stress capital buffer synchrony could be subject to additional restrictions on its ability to return capital to shareholders in addition in july the federal banking agencies proposed changes to the capital requirements of banking organizations that have billion or more in total assets see regulationregulation relating to our business savings and loan holding company regulationcapital to the extent the proposed changes are finalized and adopted they would likely increase our regulatory capital requirements which may decrease our return on equity and could result in limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock if synchrony or the bank fails to meet current or future minimum capital leverage or other financial requirements its operations results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected among other things failure by synchrony or the bank to maintain its status as well capitalized or otherwise meet current or future minimum capital leverage or other financial requirements could compromise our competitive position and result in restrictions imposed by the federal reserve board or the occ including potentially on the banks ability to engage in certain activities these could include restrictions on the banks ability to enter into transactions with affiliates accept brokered deposits grow its assets engage in material transactions extend credit in certain highly leveraged transactions amend or change its charter bylaws or accounting methods pay interest on its liabilities without regard to regulatory caps on the rates that may be paid on deposits and pay dividends or repurchase stock in addition failure to maintain the well capitalized status of the bank could result in our having to invest additional capital in the bank which could in turn require us to raise additional capital the market and demand for and cost of

liquidity management apply to covered savings and loan holding companies with billion or more in average total consolidated assets based on a four quarter average see regulation regulation relating to our businesslegislative and regulatory developments because synchrony met the fourquarter average total consolidated assets threshold as of march such requirements will apply to us in the future after a transition period which could cause our results of operations and financial condition to be materially adversely affected we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness we are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock by the federal reserve board which has broad authority to review our capital planning and risk management processes and our current projected and stressed capital levels and to object to any capital action that the federal reserve board considers to be unsafe or unsound in addition the declaration and amount of any future dividends to holders of our common stock or stock repurchases will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on many factors including our financial condition earnings capital and liquidity position including the bank applicable regulatory requirements corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant any inability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of synchrony financial see regulationregulation relating to our businesssavings and loan holding company regulationdividends and stock repurchases we rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity including to pay our obligations under our indebtedness and other indebtedness as they become due and federal law limits the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us for example occ regulations limit the ability of savings associations to make distributions of capital including payment of dividends stock redemptions and repurchases cashout mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account the bank must obtain the occs approval prior to making a capital distribution in certain circumstances including if the bank proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet certain capital requirements or will not do so as a result of the proposed capital distribution or certain net income requirements in addition the bank must file a prior written notice of a planned or declared dividend or other distribution with the federal reserve board the federal reserve board or the occ may object to a capital distribution if among other things the bank is or as a result of such dividend or distribution would be undercapitalized or the federal reserve board or occ has safety and soundness concerns additional restrictions on bank dividends may apply if the bank fails the qtl test the application of these restrictions on the banks ability to pay dividends involves broad discretion on the part of our regulators limitations on the banks payments of dividends and other distributions and payments that we receive from the bank could reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to pay dividends or our obligations under our indebtedness see regulationregulation relating to our businesssavings association regulationdividends and stock repurchases and activities regulations relating to privacy information security and data protection could increase our costs affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities we are subject to various privacy information security and data protection laws including requirements concerning security breach notification and we could be negatively impacted by them for example in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to the glba and implementing regulations and guidance among other things the glba i imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties ii requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to opt out of the institutions disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties with certain exceptions and iii requires financial institutions to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institutions size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institutions activities and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches moreover various united states federal banking regulatory agencies states and foreign jurisdictions have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual consumer regulatory andor law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach many of these requirements also apply broadly to our partners that accept our cards in many countries that have yet to impose data security breach notification requirements regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data security breaches furthermore legislators andor regulators in the united states and other countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy data protection and information security related practices our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer andor employee information and some of our current or planned business activities this could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives in the united states this includes increased privacyrelated enforcement activity at the federal level by the federal trade commission as well as at the state level such as with regard to mobile applications and state legislation such as the ccpa which could increase our costs in the european union this includes the general data protection regulation see regulationregulation relating to our businessprivacy compliance with current or future privacy data protection and information security laws including those regarding security breach notification and consumer privacy affecting customer andor employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services such as products or services that involve us sharing information with third parties or storing sensitive credit card information which could materially and adversely affect our profitability our failure to comply with privacy data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory investigations and government actions litigation fines or sanctions consumer or partner actions and damage to our reputation and our brand all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our use of thirdparty vendors and our other ongoing thirdparty business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention we regularly use thirdparty vendors and subcontractors as part of our business we also have substantial ongoing business relationships with our partners and other third parties these types of thirdparty relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank regulators the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic and our consumer financial services regulator the cfpb regulatory guidance requires us to enhance our due diligence ongoing monitoring and control over our thirdparty vendors and subcontractors and other ongoing thirdparty business relationships including with our partners in certain cases we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors andor their subcontractors to meet these enhanced requirements which could increase our costs these regulatory expectations may change and potentially become more rigorous in certain ways due to an interagency effort to replace existing guidance on the risk management of thirdparty relationships with new guidance we expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our thirdparty relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships as a result if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our thirdparty vendors and subcontractors or other ongoing thirdparty business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately we could be subject to enforcement actions including the imposition of civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation failure to comply with antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us we maintain an enterprisewide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations including but not limited to the bank secrecy act and the patriot act this program includes policies procedures processes and other internal controls designed to identify monitor manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products services customers and geographic locale these controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions perform customer due diligence respond to requests from law enforcement identify and verify a legal entity customers beneficial owners at the time a new account is opened and to understand the nature and purpose of the customer relationship and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments we cannot be sure our programs and controls will be effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable antimoney laundering and antiterrorism financing laws and regulations and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions fines penalties and reputational harm all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition
