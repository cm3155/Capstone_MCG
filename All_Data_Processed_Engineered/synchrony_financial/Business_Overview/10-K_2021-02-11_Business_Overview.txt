                                  acquiring and marketing to retail card payment solutions customers in our retail card and payment solutions platforms we work directly with our partners using their distribution network communication channels and customer interactions to market our products to their existing and potential customers we believe our presence at partners points of sale instore online and mobile locations and our ability to make credit decisions instantly for a customer already predisposed to make a purchase enables us to acquire new customer accounts at a lower cost than issuers of general purpose cards to acquire new customers we collaborate and deeply integrate with our partners and leverage our marketing expertise to create programs promoting our products to creditworthy customers frequently our partners market the availability of credit as part of the advertising for their goods and services our marketing programs include marketing offers eg off the customers first purchase and consumer communications delivered through a variety of channels including instore signage online advertising retailer website placement associate communication emails text messages direct mail campaigns advertising circulars and outside marketing via television radio print and digital marketing search engine optimization paid search and personalization we also employ our proprietary quickscreen acquisition method to make targeted preapproved credit offers at the pointofsale our quickscreen technology allows us to process customer information obtained from our partners through our risk models such that when these customers seek to make payment for goods and services at our partners pointsofsale we can offer them credit instantly if appropriate based on our experience due to the personalized and immediate nature of the offer quickscreen significantly outperforms traditional directtoconsumer preapproved channels such as direct mail or email in response rate and dollar spending in payment solutions we also market the value of crossnetwork benefits to our partners for example the synchrony car care credit card offers motorists the convenience of one card to pay for comprehensive auto care at thousands of service and parts locations as well as fuel at gas stations nationwide in addition the synchrony home network allows customers to finance items from home décor to mattresses to flooring at thousands of participating home locations nationwide acquiring and marketing to carecredit customers we market our products through our network of providers by training them on the advantages of carecredit and by creating marketing materials for providers to use to promote the program and educate customers our training helps our providers learn to discuss payment options during the pretreatment consultation phase including the option to apply for a carecredit credit card and the offer of promotional credit according to a survey of our carecredit customers indicated they would have postponed or reduced the scope of treatment if financing was not offered by their provider consumers can apply for our carecredit products in the providers office or online via the web or mobile device as the market continues to evolve we are increasingly seeing more customers from mobile and internet channels consumers are going online to look for information about the types of procedures or care they need where to receive that care and how to pay for it as such we are promoting carecredit directly to potential and existing customers using digital marketing our provider locator on our website allows customers to search among the more than locations that accept the carecredit credit card by desired geography and provider type according to our records our carecredit provider locator averaged over million searches per month during the year ended december we believe our partners recognize the locator as an important source of new customer acquisition and information about their practice we believe going direct to consumers through digital marketing will have several benefits customers will have a better understanding of the types of care they can pay for the different financing options available and where they can use carecredit in addition whether they choose to apply online or in the providers office once approved they can move forward with the care they want or need to feel better enterprise customer engagement ece analytics after a customer obtains one of our products our marketing programs encourage ongoing card usage by communicating the benefits of our products value propositions examples of such programs include promotional financing offers cardholder events product and partner discounts dollaroff certificates account holder sales reward points and offers new product announcements and previews and other specific partner value offerings these programs are executed through our partners and our own direct to consumer distribution channels our ece and data analytics teams help us expand and optimize customer relationships through the building of targeting tools and the deployment of detailed testandlearn tracking of cardholder responsiveness to these omnichannel marketing campaigns leveraging thousands of customer data points curated through customer interactions with synchrony and accessed through thirdparty relationships synchronys more than business analysts and data scientists apply sophisticated analytic techniques to create signals and tools allowing customized marketing messages and treatments for example if through test and learn we see cardholders of a certain type consistently click on a banner with a combination of a certain font color and message we will display future marketing messages to these type of customers in a similar manner this closed loop learning process uses a set of analytics tools to read and react in real time using machine learning algorithms to the customers response to these treatments this example is repeated thousands of times a month across digital and nondigital use cases to constantly maximize campaign response customer share of wallet and program profitability our understanding of our dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card programs are further enhanced by the collection and analysis of data on customers spending patterns merchant category code online spend etc at other retailers these additional signals and scores help drive incremental volume for our programs while maximizing return on investment our extensive marketing activities targeted to existing customers have yielded high levels of reuse across both our payment solutions and carecredit sales platforms during the year ended december excluding oil and gas retail partner programs and of purchase volume across our payment solutions platform and carecredit network respectively resulted from repeat use at one or more retailers or providers digital and mobile capabilities we

experience our approach continues to be customer and partnercentric to reach our customers in unique ways at home in store online or wherever they prefer our investment is focused on all aspects of

risk of loss arising from customer default when customers are unable or unwilling to meet their financial obligations to us our credit risk arising from credit products is generally highly diversified across approximately million open accounts at december without significant individual exposures we manage credit risk primarily according to customer segments and product types customer account acquisition we have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and have developed varying credit decision guidelines for the different partners we originate credit accounts through several different channels including instore mail internet mobile telephone and preapproved solicitations in addition we have and may in the future acquire accounts that were originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners regardless of the channel in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit we follow a series of credit risk and underwriting procedures in most cases when applications are made instore or digitally the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of our credit decision immediately we generally obtain certain information provided by the applicant and obtain a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus the credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary scoring models developed to calculate a credit score the credit risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line assignments for each portfolio and product type we periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to projected performance and adjust the minimum score or the opening credit limit to manage credit risk we also apply additional application screens based on various inputs including credit bureau information alternative data our previous experience with the customer and information provided by our partner to help identify additional factors such as potential fraud and prior bankruptcies before qualifying the application for approval we compare applicants names against the specially designated nationals list maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury ofac as well as screens that account for adherence to usa patriot act of the patriot act and credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the card act requirements including ability to pay requirements we also use preapproved account solicitations for certain programs potential applicants are prescreened using information provided by our partner or obtained from outside lists and qualified individuals receive a preapproved credit offer by mail or email acquired portfolio evaluation our risk management team evaluates each portfolio that we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies our credit risk guidelines as part of this review we receive data on the thirdparty accounts and loans which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain core characteristics such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information in addition we benchmark potential portfolio acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks finally our risk management team must approve the acquisition taking into account the results of our risk assessment process once assets are migrated to our systems our account management protocols will apply immediately as described below under customer account management credit authorizations of individual transactions and collections customer account management we regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts this ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customers performance with respect to their account with us as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customers broader credit performance to monitor and control the quality of our loan portfolio including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to score each active account on its monthly cycle date proprietary risk models together with the credit scores obtained on each active account no less than quarterly are an integral part of our credit decisionmaking process depending on the duration of the customers account risk profile and other performance metrics the account may be subject to a range of account actions including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits credit authorizations of individual transactions once an account has been opened when a credit card is used to make a purchase instore at one of our partners locations or online pointofsale terminals or online sites have an online connection with our credit authorization system which allows for realtime updating of accounts each potential sales transaction is passed through a transaction authorization system which considers a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be approved or declined and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted fraud investigation we provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings new account fraud and transactional fraud we have developed a proprietary fraud model to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customers established pattern our proprietary model is also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our customers we also are continuously implementing new and improved technologies to detect and prevent fraud collections all monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts collections personnel generally initiate contact with customers within days after any portion of their balance becomes past due the nature and the timing of the initial contact typically a personal call email text message or letter are determined by a review of the customers prior account activity and payment habits we reevaluate our collection efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques including internal collection activities use of external vendors and the sale of debt to thirdparty buyers as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent we limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the transaction authorization processes the imposition of credit limits and criteriabased account suspension and revocation processes in certain situations we may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules decrease interest rates andor waive fees to aid customers experiencing financial difficulties in their efforts to become current on their obligations to us customer service                                                                                              customer service is an important feature of our relationship with our partners our customers can

enables us to operate our business efficiently the integration of our technology with our partners is at the core of our value proposition enabling among other things customers to apply and buy at the

flexible technology and operational platforms to support marketing risk management account acquisition and account management customer service and new product innovation and development we believe that the continued investment in and development of these platforms is an important part of our efforts to increase our competitive capabilities reduce costs improve quality and provide faster more flexible technology services therefore we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems processes and competencies to meet our business needs as part of our continuous efforts to enhance our technological capabilities we may either develop these capabilities internally or in partnership with thirdparty providers our internal approach involves deployment of crossfunctional product teams often in collaboration with our partners focused on driving rapid delivery of inhouse product innovation and development and the commercialization of new products in addition at times we also partner with thirdparty providers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure based on strategies and in some cases architecture designed by us we leverage fiserv for our credit card transaction processing and production and our retail banking operations data security the protection and security of financial and personal information of our consumers is one of our highest priorities we have implemented a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards that we believe provide an appropriate level of protection to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of our companys and our customers information this includes protecting against any known or evolving threats to the security or integrity of customer records and information and against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information our information security program is continuously adapting to an evolving landscape of emerging threats and available technology through data gathering and evaluation of emerging threats from internal and external incidents and technology investment security controls are adjusted on a continuous basis we work directly with our partners on an ongoing basis by sharing cyber intelligence and facilitating awareness and communications of events outside of the company we have developed a security strategy and implemented multiple layers of controls embedded throughout our technology environment that establish multiple control points between threats and our assets our security program is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store process or have access to sensitive data and we require the same level of protection from such thirdparty service providers we evaluate the effectiveness of the key security controls through ongoing assessment and measurement in addition we identify risks that may threaten customer information and utilize both internal and external resources to perform a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms systems and applications used to provide our products and services we employ backup and disaster recovery procedures for all the systems that are used for storing processing and transferring customer information and we periodically test and validate our disaster recovery plans further we regularly utilize independent assessors to evaluate the appropriateness of our overall program we are compliant with the payment card industry pci data security standard dss intellectual property

and our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit develop motivate and retain employees with the skills to execute our longterm strategy in we significantly revised our approach to human capital management in response to the covid19 pandemic starting in march we equipped nearly all employees to work from home including our thousands of customer service agents in call centers our agile developers in our innovation labs and our senior executives in corporate headquarters we instituted safety protocols and procedures for the small number of essential employees who continued to work at our physical locations we have also changed our overall approach to getting work done by adopting a hub model that will enable employees across job roles and levels to work from home when they want or fulltime and visit a hub eg a coworking space synchrony office university space or other gathering spots when they need to meet facetoface once the pandemic is over physical hubs will be used as cultural and innovation centers by hosting events town halls agile sprints networking and other important business activities allowing us to retain the human personal connection of a traditional workplace while providing employees greater flexibility at december we had over full time employees our global workforce has decreased slightly compared to the prior year as we have focused on efficiencies such as hiring freezes in response to the covid19 pandemic in january we further reduced headcount through a significant enhanced pandemic severance program resulting in headcount reductions that were more than voluntary and provided a minimum of months of pay and benefits the enhanced voluntary and involuntary severance plan helped support our workforce during a time of economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic at december our global workforce was female and male in the united states ethnicity of our workforce was white black hispanic asian two or more races native american native hawaiian or pacific islander and that did not list ethnicity at synchrony diversity and inclusion are core to our corporate culture in we embraced our responsibility to further integrate diversity and inclusion into our longterm business strategy to drive progress over the long term we treat diversity and inclusion as important business priorities with i new board approved governance rules imperatives and accountability mechanisms to measure results and ii a revised annual incentive program for that incorporates diversity factors when determining payouts we also created a seniorlevel committee led by our president chief diversity officer and others charged with developing an enterprisewide strategy setting measurable goals and providing progress reports to our board and employees across all areas of the business we used data analytics to identify gaps in our hiring and promotion processes as a result we are putting more focus on the hiring development and progression of underrepresented minorities with an emphasis on black and hispanic talent among other actions we have tied leaders performance metrics to diversity factors provided for diverse candidate slates for senior roles and launched a new leadership development program designed to advance diverse employees regulation                                                                                              our business including our relationships with our customers is subject to regulation supervision and examination under us federal state and foreign laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending practices treatment of our customers safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure liquidity dividends and other capital distributions transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel as a savings and loan holding company and financial holding company synchrony is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as a large provider of consumer financial services we are also subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb the bank is a federally chartered savings association as such the bank is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency of the us treasury the occ which is its primary regulator and by the cfpb in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is supervised by the fdic for a discussion of the specific regulations related to our business see regulationregulation relating to our business of this s for unemployment benefits in the united states will result in an increase from current levels in the companys delinquencies and net chargeoff rate in we expect these increases to be partially mitigated by the effects of governmental actions such as the cares act as amended by the consolidated appropriations act as well as any further proposed stimulus in as such we anticipate experiencing increases to both delinquencies and net chargeoffs to occur in the second half of during we also took certain forbearance actions for our customers impacted by covid19 while we have experienced a higher incidence rate of accounts becoming delinquent following their exit from these shortterm programs as compared to accounts that did not enter the forbearance program we do not expect these actions to have a material impact to the companys overall delinquency metrics we have also experienced an increase to our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses during the year ended december attributable to the impact of covid19 and our allowance coverage ratio at december was as the economic environment develops during we anticipate that our loan loss reserve builds will be lower than those experienced in however to the extent the current environment continues beyond our expectations or deteriorates further we may experience further increases to our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses related to covid19 retailer share arrangement payments under our program agreements retailer share arrangements decreased to billion for the year ended december reflecting the impact of covid19 on program performance we believe that the payments we make to our partners under our retailer share arrangements in the aggregate in are likely to decrease in absolute terms compared to the year ended december primarily as a result of the performance of our programs which would reflect the expected credit trends discussed above this decrease will be partially offset by growth of the programs see managements discussion and analysisretailer share arrangements for additional information on these agreements extended duration of our retail card program agreements our retail card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years and the average length of our relationship with our retail card partners is years we expect to continue to benefit from these programs on a longterm basis a total of of our ongoing retail card program agreements have an expiration date in or beyond these program agreements represented in the aggregate and of our retail card interest and fees on loans for the year ended december and of our retail card loan receivables at december attributable to our ongoing programs growth in interchange revenues and loyalty program costs we believe that as a result of the overall growth in dual card and general purpose co branded credit card transactions occurring outside of our retail card partners locations interchange revenues will increase in excess of the growth of our retail card loan receivables the expected growth in these transactions is driven in part by both existing and new loyalty programs with our retail card partners in addition we continue to offer and add new loyalty programs for our private label credit cards for which we typically do not receive interchange fees the growth in these existing and new loyalty programs will result in an increase in costs associated with these programs overall we expect our loyalty program costs to continue to be largely offset by our interchange revenues these changes have been contemplated in our program agreements with our retail card partners and are a component of the calculation of our payments due under our retailer share arrangements capital and liquidity levels we continue to expect to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity resources to support our daily operations our business growth and our credit ratings as well as regulatory and compliance requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments during the year ended december we declared and paid dividends of million and repurchased billion of our outstanding common stock in response to the covid19 outbreak we temporarily suspended our share repurchase plans in we plan to continue to deploy capital through both dividends and share repurchases subject to regulatory approval as well as to support business growth in january we announced that the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program of up to billion through december beginning in the first quarter of subject to the companys capital plan market conditions and other factors including regulatory restrictions and required approvals if any we continue to expect to maintain capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements at december the company had a basel iii common equity tier ratio of which reflects our election to defer the impact of cecl on our regulatory capital which will now be phasedin over a threeyear period from january through december we expect that our liquidity portfolio will continue to be sufficient to support all of our business objectives and to meet all regulatory requirements for the foreseeable future at december due to the reduction in loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform we continued to carry a high level of liquidity which we expect to continue through the first half of in line with our expectations of customer payment behavior we expect to deploy this excess liquidity during the second half of in line with our expectations of receivable growth which will contribute to an increase in net interest margin in the second half of as we deploy this excess liquidity seasonality in our retail card and payment solutions platforms we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from august through a peak in late december with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down the seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations delinquency metrics and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods these fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year in addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above we also typically experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net chargeoff rates in the first and second quarters our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net chargeoff rates in the third and fourth quarters because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in chargeoffs as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end consistent with this historical experience we generally experience a higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period as compared to the end of a calendar year in addition despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end reflecting these same seasonal trends interest income interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans which includes merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us in almost all cases for all or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities we include in interest and fees on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straightline basis over a oneyear period and recorded in interest and fees on loans for noncredit card receivables direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans we analyze interest income as a function of two principal components average interestearning assets and yield on average interestearning assets key drivers of average interestearning assets include purchase volumes which are influenced by a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence generally our partners sales and our ability to increase our share of those sales payment rates reflecting the extent to which customers maintain a credit balance chargeoffs reflecting the receivables that are deemed not to be collectible the size of our liquidity portfolio and portfolio acquisitions when we enter into new partner relationships key drivers of yield on average interestearning assets include pricing contractual rates of interest movement in prime rates late fees and merchant discount rates changes to our mix of loans eg the number of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to standard rates frequency of late fees incurred when account holders fail to make their minimum payment by the required due date credit performance and accrual status of our loans and yield earned on our liquidity portfolio interest income decreased by billion or for the year ended december the decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in interest and fees on loans related to the walmart consumer portfolio sale as well as the impact of covid19 the sale of the walmart consumer portfolio drove a decline in interest and fees on loans compared to the prior year period of approximately average interestearning assets years ended december in millions loan receivables including held for sale liquidity portfolio and other total average interestearning assets the decrease in average loan receivables including held for sale of for the year ended december was primarily driven by the sale of loan receivables associated with the walmart and yamaha portfolios in october and january respectively in addition the decreases also reflect a decline in average active accounts of at our ongoing partner programs primarily due to the impact of covid19 yield on average interestearning assets the yield on average interestearning assets decreased for the year ended december primarily due to a decrease in the yield on average loan receivables and a decrease in the percentage of interestearning assets attributable to loan receivables the yield on average loan receivables including held for sale decreased basis points to for the year ended december primarily driven by lower benchmark rates and the sale of the walmart consumer portfolio as well as fee and interest waivers related to covid19 interest expense interest expense is incurred on our interestbearing liabilities which consisted of interestbearing deposit accounts borrowings of consolidated securitization entities and senior unsecured notes key drivers of interest expense include the amounts outstanding of our deposits and borrowings the interest rate environment and its effect on interest rates paid on our funding sources and the changing mix in our funding sources interest expense decreased by million or for the year ended december primarily driven by lower benchmark interest rates and a decrease in borrowings of our securitization entities and senior unsecured notes our cost of funds decreased to for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december average interestbearing liabilities years ended december in millions interestbearing deposit accounts borrowings of consolidated securitization entities senior unsecured notes total average interestbearing liabilities the decrease in average interestbearing liabilities for the year ended december was primarily driven by a decrease in borrowings of our securitization entities and senior unsecured notes net interest income net interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense net interest income decreased by billion or for the year ended december primarily driven by a decrease in interest and fees on loans related to the walmart consumer portfolio sale and the impact of covid19 partially offset by a decrease in interest expense reflecting lower benchmark interest rates retailer share arrangements most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold we also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements for example on our cobranded credit cards all of these arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products although the retailer share arrangements vary by partner these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program based typically on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for credit losses retailer payments and operating expenses and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold the threshold and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on among other things agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses and therefore increases in our actual expenses such as funding costs or operating expenses may not necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have generally increased in recent years primarily as a result of the growth and performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements as well as changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years we believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners interests with ours we also believe that the changes to the terms of certain program agreements in recent years will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease and mitigate the impact on our profitability in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements retailer share arrangements decreased by million or for the year ended december reflecting the impact of covid19 on program performance provision for credit losses provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the expected credit losses for the life of the loan balance as of the period end date provision for credit losses in each period is a function of net chargeoffs gross chargeoffs net of recoveries and the required level of the allowance for credit losses our process to determine our allowance for credit losses is based upon our estimate of expected credit losses for the life of the loan balance as of the period end date see critical accounting estimates allowance for credit losses and note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our allowance for credit loss methodology provision for credit losses increased by billion or for the year ended december primarily driven by the effects of the prior year reductions in reserves for credit losses related to the walmart consumer portfolio sale and higher reserve build in the current year partially offset by lower net chargeoffs the higher reserve build reflects both the projected impacts of covid19 and the increase attributable to the cecl implementation of million for the year ended december the prior year reductions in reserves related to the walmart consumer portfolio were billion for the year ended december our allowance

million or for the year ended december driven by lower purchase volume and the effects from the walmart consumer portfolio sale debt cancellation fees debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers customers who choose to purchase these products are charged a monthly fee based on their account balance in return we will cancel all or a

direct mail debt cancellation fees increased by million or for the year ended december primarily as a result of increases in our carecredit and payment solutions sales platforms partially offset by the effects from the walmart consumer portfolio sale loyalty programs we operate a number of loyalty programs primarily in our retail card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty these programs typically provide cardholders with statement credit or cash back rewards other programs include rewards points which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards or merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a preset spending level on their private label credit card dual card or general purpose cobranded credit card growth in loyalty program payments has been and is expected to continue to be driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and

for which we have granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties where we do not receive adequate compensation these loans are identified at the point when the borrower enters into a modification program see note loan receivables and allowance for credit losses to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on loans classified as tdrs however shortterm loan modifications to support our customers impacted by covid19 are not accounted for as a tdr under the cares act banks may elect to deem that loan modifications do not result in tdrs if they are related to covid19 executed on a loan that was not more than days past due as of december and executed between march and the earlier of a days after the date of termination of the national emergency or b january at december we have not made such an election however certain other shortterm modifications made on a good faith basis in response to covid19 are also not considered tdrs under asc subtopic this includes delays in payment that are insignificant or shortterm eg up to six months modifications such as payment deferrals fee waivers or extensions of repayment terms to borrowers who were current prior to any relief borrowers considered current are those that are less than days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented during we provided support to our customers impacted by covid19 through various actions such as minimum payment deferrals and interest and late fee waivers loans enrolled in minimum payment deferrals generally continued to accrue interest and their delinquency status as of the modification date did not advance through the deferment period during the year ended december we enrolled approximately million customers in shortterm modifications to defer minimum payments representing billion in loan receivables the substantial majority of these enrollments were for our credit card customers for certain customers we also provided waivers of interest charges or late fees during the year ended december the waivers of interest and late fees provided to our customers resulted in foregone interest and fee income of million at december all of the enrolled accounts have exited our forbearance programs while we have experienced a higher incidence rate of accounts becoming delinquent following their exit from these shortterm programs as compared to accounts that did not enter the forbearance program these accounts did not have a material impact to the companys overall delinquency metrics at december delinquencies over30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of periodend loan receivables decreased to at december as compared to at december the basis point decrease in was primarily driven by an improvement in customer payment behavior net chargeoffs net chargeoffs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible net of recovered amounts we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and thirdparty fraud losses from chargeoffs chargedoff and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while thirdparty fraud losses are included in other expense chargeoffs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses and subsequent recoveries of previously chargedoff amounts are credited to the allowance for credit losses costs incurred to recover chargedoff loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our consolidated statements of earnings the table below sets forth the ratio of net chargeoffs to average loan receivables including held for sale net chargeoff rate for the periods indicated years ended december net chargeoff rate allowance for credit losses and impact of adoption of cecl the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at december compared with allowance for loan losses of billion at december similarly our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables increased to at december from at december the increases in the allowance for credit losses and allowance coverage ratio reflect the impact of the cecl adoption and implementation in january upon adoption of the accounting standard on january we recorded an increase to our allowance for loan losses of billion the allowance for credit losses at december reflects our estimate of expected credit losses for the life of the loan receivables on our consolidated statement of financial position at december which includes the consideration of current and expected macroeconomic conditions that existed at that date during the initial year of implementation of the cecl accounting standard we continued to determine what our allowance for credit losses and allowance coverage ratio would have been if the prior accounting guidance were still in effect in order to help provide comparability with our prior year results the following table

in addition to the effects of the increases attributable to cecl noted in the above table our allowance coverage ratio increased as compared to december primarily due to the projected impacts from covid19 credit quality indicators as part of our credit risk management activities on an ongoing basis we assess overall credit quality by reviewing information related to the performance of a customers account with us as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customers broader credit performance we now utilize vantagescore vantage credit scores to assist in our assessment of credit quality as we believe vantage scores more us consumers and potential applicants as compared to our prior use of fico credit scores vantage credit scores are obtained at origination of the account and are refreshed at a minimum quarterly but could be as often as weekly to assist in predicting customer behavior we categorize these credit scores into the following three credit score categories i or higher which are considered the strongest credits ii to considered moderate credit risk and iii or less which are considered weaker credits we believe these three categories of vantage credit scores represent an approximation of the categories previously reported using fico data in terms of both probability of default and customer account distribution the following charts show the proportion of our loan portfolios that were from customers with a vantage score of or higher as compared to those customers with a fico score of or higher the quarterly information presented

certificates of deposit iras money market accounts and savings accounts brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms we have relationships with brokers that offer our deposits through their networks our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at december had a weighted average remaining life of years these deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to among other things the interest rates we pay and therefore we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates or interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits to mitigate these risks our funding strategy includes a range of

sustain business operations fund asset growth satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions we maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business which is the responsibility of our asset and liability management committee a subcommittee of the risk committee of our board of directors we employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity we perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process we evaluate a range of stress scenarios including company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs we maintain a liquidity portfolio which at december had billion of liquid assets primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and shortterm obligations of the us treasury less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid compared to billion of liquid assets at december the increase in liquid assets was primarily due to the reduction in our loan receivables and the retention of excess cash flows from operations additionally on march in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve board reduced reserve requirements for insured depository institutions to zero percent which further increased the banks available liquidity we believe our liquidity position at december remains strong as we continue to operate in a period of uncertain economic conditions related to covid19 and we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity as economic conditions change as additional sources of liquidity at december we had an aggregate of billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under our securitization programs and billion of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders and we had more than billion of unencumbered assets in the bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the federal reserve board for credit at the discount window as a general matter investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash the level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions we rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity however bank regulations contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the banks ability to pay dividends see regulationrisk factors relating to regulationwe are subject to

rates indices correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates see risksrisk factors relating to our businesschanges in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings funding and liquidity and a reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets interest rate risk we borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease as some of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is generally the prime rate and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either libor or the federal funds rate the prime rate and the libor or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities competitive factors and future regulatory reform may limit or restrict our ability to raise interest rates on our loans in addition some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers if interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely manner our net interest income and margin could be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings interest rates may also adversely impact our customers spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us our floating rate products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowances for credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us and reductions in deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity at december of our loan receivables were priced at a fixed interest rate to the customer with the remaining at a floating interest rate we fund our assets with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits assetbacked securities and unsecured debt to manage interest rate risk we seek to match the interest rate repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities historically we have not used interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk however we may choose to do so in the future to the extent we are unable to effectively match the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities our net earnings could be materially adversely affected we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect of various interest rate scenarios on our net interest income for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates over the 12month period from our reporting date we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical immediate basis point increase or decrease in interest rates as of the beginning of the period the sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase or decrease instantaneously simultaneously and to the same degree our interest rate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity portfolio at december of our receivables were priced at a floating interest rate assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature or otherwise contractually reset to a marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12month period are considered to be rate sensitive the latter category includes certain loans that may be offered at belowmarket rates for an introductory period such as balance transfers and special promotional programs after which the loans will contractually reprice under standard terms in accordance with our normal marketbased pricing structure for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans only the effect of the hypothetical basis point change in the underlying marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice ie assets are categorized as fixed or floating according to their underlying contractual terms for assets that have a fixed interest rate at the period end but which contractually will or are assumed to reset to a marketbased indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next months net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12month period thus liabilities that vary with changes in a marketbased index such as the federal funds rate or libor which will reset before the end of the 12month period or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a marketbased indexed rate prior to the end of the month period also are considered to be rate sensitive for these fixed rate liabilities net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date the following table presents the approximate net interest income impacts forecasted over the next twelve months from an immediate and parallel change in interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december basis point change in millions basis points basis points at december limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information internallydeveloped assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies which project borrower and deposit behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments other market inputs such as interest rates market prices and interest rate volatility are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures we regularly evaluate update and enhance these assumptions models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates the sensitivity analysis provided above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is based on the existing balance sheet as well as assumptions around future growth pricing and balance sheet composition it does not attempt to estimate the effect of a more significant interest rate increase over a sustained period of time which as described in interest rate risk above could adversely affect our net interest income in addition the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ from our projections which could cause our actual net interest income to differ from the above sensitivity analysis capital

critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties the critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for credit losses and fair value measurements these estimates reflect our best judgment about current and for some estimates future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements if these conditions change from those expected it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables or material changes to our consolidated statement of financial position among other effects see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements which discusses the significant accounting policies related to these estimates allowance for credit losses effective january losses on loan receivables are estimated and recognized upon origination of the loan based on expected credit losses for the life of the loan balance as of the period end date this requires us to estimate expected losses in the portfolio as of each balance sheet date the method for calculating the estimate of expected credit loss takes into account historical experience and current conditions and future expectations for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future the model utilizes a macroeconomic forecast with unemployment claims as the primary macroeconomic variable we also perform a qualitative assessment in addition to model estimates and apply qualitative adjustments as necessary the reasonable and supportable forecast period is determined primarily based upon an assessment of the current economic outlook including the effects of covid19 and our ability to use available data to accurately forecast losses over time the reasonable and supportable forecast period used in our estimate of credit losses at december was months consistent with the forecast period utilized since adoption of cecl the company reassesses the reasonable and supportable forecast period on a quarterly basis beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period we revert to historical loss information at the loan receivables segment level over a 6month period gradually increasing the weight of historical losses by an equal amount each month during the reversion period and utilize historical loss information thereafter for the remaining life of the portfolio the reversion period similar to the reasonable and supportable forecast period may change in the future depending on multiple factors such as forecasting methods portfolio changes and macroeconomic environment we evaluate each portfolio quarterly for credit card receivables our estimation process includes analysis of historical data and there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance our risk process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or on a portfolio basis as appropriate more specifically we use an enhanced migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency the enhanced migration analysis considers uncollectible principal interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables segmented by credit and business parameters we use other analyses to estimate expected losses on nondelinquent accounts which include past performance bankruptcy activity such as filings policy changes loan volumes and amounts holistically for assessing the portfolio credit loss content we also evaluate portfolio risk management techniques applied to various accounts historical behavior of different account vintages account seasoning economic conditions recent trends in delinquencies account collection management forecasting uncertainties expectations about the future and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses we estimate our allowance for credit losses using pools of loans with similar risk characteristics further experience is not available for new portfolios therefore while we accumulate experience we utilize our experience with the most closely analogous products and segments in our portfolio the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current and forecasted conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process which can result in changes to our assumptions changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for credit losses it is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates fair value measurements assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities as well as contingent consideration obligations assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances primarily include acquired loans loans that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral cost method and equity method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs a fair value measurement is determined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date the determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued new accounting standards

risk factors contained in this annual report on s for unemployment benefits in the us for more information see managements discussion and analysisresults of operationsbusiness trends and conditions in addition the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including restricting employee travel and transitioning nearly all of our employees to working from home and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees partners and customers the outbreak has adversely impacted and may further adversely impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our partners customers suppliers and thirdparty vendors throughout the time period during which the spread of covid19 continues and related restrictions remain in place and even after the covid19 outbreak has subsided in particular we may experience financial losses due to a number of operational factors including continued store closures by partners or if one or more partners becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding thirdparty disruptions including potential outages at thirdparty operated call centers and other suppliers increased cyber and payment fraud risk related to covid19 as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption given increased online banking e commerce and other online activity challenges to the availability and reliability of our network due to changes to normal operations including the possibility of one or more clusters of covid19 cases affecting our employees or affecting the systems or employees of our partners and an increased volume of unanticipated customer and regulatory requests for information and support or additional regulatory requirements which could require additional resources and costs to address including for example government initiatives to reduce or eliminate payments costs even after the covid19 outbreak has subsided our business may continue to experience materially adverse impacts as a result of the viruss economic impact social and behavioral impact including the availability and cost of funding and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect covid19 as a global pandemic may have and as a result the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change we do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business our operations or the economy as a whole however the effects have and are likely to continue to have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described herein our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners substantially all of our revenue is generated from the credit products we provide to customers of our partners pursuant to program agreements we enter into with our partners as a result our results of operations and growth depend on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners historically there has been turnover in our partners and we expect this will continue in the future for example in we announced that we would not be renewing our retail card program agreement with walmart program agreements with our retail card partners and national and regional retailer and manufacturer payment solutions partners typically are for multiyear terms these program agreements generally permit our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons including in some cases if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria we fail to achieve certain targets with respect to approvals of new customers as a result of the credit criteria we use we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds or we are not adequately capitalized or certain force majeure events or changes in our ownership occur or a material adverse change in our financial condition occurs a few payment solutions programs with national and regional retailer and manufacturer partners also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified notice to us eg several months in addition programs with manufacturers buying groups and industry associations generally are made available to payment solutions partners such as individual retail outlets dealers and merchants under dealer agreements which typically may be terminated at will by the partner on short notice to us eg days there is significant competition for our existing partners and our failure to retain our existing larger partner relationships upon the expiration or our earlier loss of a relationship upon the exercise of a partners early termination rights or the expiration or termination of a substantial number of smaller partner relationships could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including growth rates and financial condition to the extent we do not acquire new partners of similar size and profitability or otherwise grow our business in addition existing relationships may be renewed with less favorable terms to the company in response to increased competition for such relationships the competition for new partners is also significant and our failure to attract new partners could adversely affect our ability to grow a significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small number of retail card partners and the loss of any of these retail card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations based upon interest and fees on loans for the year ended december our five largest programs were gap jcpenney lowes paypal and sams club these programs accounted in aggregate for of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended december and of loan receivables at december our programs with lowes and paypal which includes our venmo program each accounted for more than of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended december see our businessour sales platformsretail card partners the program agreements generally permit us or our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date under various circumstances as described in the preceding risk factor some of our program agreements also provide that upon expiration or termination our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loans generated with respect to its program and all related customer data the loss of any of our largest partners or a material reduction in the interest and fees we receive from their customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition our business is heavily concentrated in us consumer credit and therefore our results are more susceptible to fluctuations in that market than a more diversified company our business is heavily concentrated in us consumer credit as a result we are more susceptible to fluctuations and risks particular to us consumer credit than a more diversified company for example our business is particularly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that affect the us economy consumer spending and consumer credit we are also more susceptible to the risks of increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions that are targeted at consumer credit or the specific consumer credit products that we offer including promotional financing due to our carecredit platform we are also more susceptible to increased regulations and legal and other regulatory actions targeted at healthcare related procedures or services in contrast to other industries our business concentration could have an adverse effect on our results of operations our results depend to a significant extent on the active and effective promotion and support of our products by our partners our partners generally accept most major credit cards and various other forms of payment and therefore our success depends on their active and effective promotion of our products to their customers we depend on our partners to integrate the use of our credit products into their store culture by training their sales associates about our products having their sales associates encourage their customers to apply for and use our products and otherwise effectively marketing our products in addition although our retail card programs and our payment solutions programs with national and regional retailer partners typically are exclusive with respect to the credit products we offer at that partner some payment solutions programs and most carecredit provider relationships are not exclusive to us and therefore a partner may choose to promote a competitors financing over ours depending upon cost availability or attractiveness to consumers or other factors typically we do not have or utilize any recourse against these nonexclusive partners when they do not sufficiently promote our products partners may also implement or fail to implement changes in their systems and technologies that may disrupt the integration between their systems and technologies and ours which could disrupt the use of our products the failure by our partners to effectively promote and support our products as well as changes they may make in their business models that negatively impact card usage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition if our partners engage in improper business practices do not adhere to the terms of our program agreements or other contractual arrangements or standards or otherwise diminish the value of our brand we may suffer reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our results are impacted to a significant extent by the financial performance of our partners our ability to generate new loans and the interest and fees and other income associated with them is dependent upon sales of merchandise and services by our partners the retail and healthcare industries in which our partners operate are intensely competitive our partners compete with retailers and department stores in their own geographic areas as well as catalog and online sales businesses our partners in the healthcare industry compete with other healthcare providers our partners sales may decrease or may not increase as we anticipate for various reasons some of which are in the partners control and some of which are not for example partner sales may be adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions having a national regional or more local effect on consumer spending business conditions affecting the general retail environment or a particular partner or industry or catastrophes affecting broad or more discrete geographic areas if our partners sales decline for any reason it generally results in lower credit sales and therefore lower loan volume and associated interest and fees and other income for us from their customers in addition if a partner closes some or all of its stores or becomes subject to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding or if there is a perception that it may become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding its customers who have used our financing products may have less incentive to pay their outstanding balances to us which could result in higher chargeoff rates than anticipated and our costs for servicing its customers accounts may increase this risk is particularly acute with respect to our largest partners that account for a significant amount of our interest and fees on loans see a significant percentage of our interest and fees on loans comes from relationships with a small number of retail card partners and the loss of any of these retail card partners could adversely affect our business and results of operations moreover if the financial condition of a partner deteriorates significantly or a partner becomes subject to a bankruptcy proceeding we may not be able to recover for customer returns customer payments made in partner stores or other amounts due to us from the partner a decrease in sales by our partners for any reason or a bankruptcy proceeding involving any of them could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations competition in the consumer finance industry is intense the success of our business depends on our ability to retain existing partners and attract new partners the competition for partners is intense and highly competitive our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as alliance data systems american express capital one jpmorgan chase citibank td bank and wells fargo and to a lesser extent financial technology companies and potential partners own inhouse financing capabilities some of our competitors are substantially larger have substantially greater resources and may offer a broader range of products and services we compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors including program financial and other terms underwriting standards marketing expertise service levels product and service offerings including incentive and loyalty programs technological capabilities and integration brand and reputation in addition some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting eg new account approval customer service and collections and other core banking responsibilities that we retain but some partners may prefer to handle as a result of competition we may be unable to acquire new partners lose existing relationships to competing companies or find it more costly to maintain our existing relationships our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain customers and generate usage of our products by them the consumer credit and payments industry is highly competitive and we face an increasingly dynamic industry as emerging technologies enter the marketplace as a form of payment our products compete with cash checks debit cards general purpose credit cards including visa and mastercard american express and discover card various forms of consumer installment loans other private label card brands and to a certain extent prepaid cards in the future we expect our products may face increased competitive pressure to the extent that our products are not or do not continue to be accepted in or compatible with digital wallet technologies such as apple pay samsung pay android pay and other similar technologies we may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry we compete for customers and their usage of our products and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers outstanding balances based on a number of factors including pricing interest rates and fees product offerings credit limits incentives including loyalty programs and customer service although we offer a variety of consumer credit products some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services including home and automobile loans debit cards and bank branch atm access which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may give those competitors advantages including a more diversified product and customer base the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers operational efficiencies more versatile technology platforms broadbased local distribution capabilities and lowercost funding in addition some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject nonbank providers of payovertime solutions such as affirm afterpay and others extend consumer creditlike offerings but do not face the same restrictions such as capital requirements and other regulatory requirements as banks which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage customer attrition from any or all of our credit products or any lowering of the pricing of our products by reducing interest rates or fees in order to retain customers could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings in our retail deposits business we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct banking competitors we compete for deposits with traditional banks and in seeking to grow our direct banking business we compete with other banks that have direct banking models similar to ours such as ally financial american express barclays capital one ing cit citi citizens bank discover marcus by goldman sachs and purepoint competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors if we are unable to compete effectively for partners customer usage or deposits our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services our industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technologies products services and consumer preferences a key part of our financial success depends on our ability to develop and commercialize new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services including with respect to loyalty programs mobile and pointofsale technologies and new synchronybranded bank deposit and credit products realizing the benefits of those products and services is uncertain we may not assign the appropriate level of resources priority or expertise to the development and commercialization of these new products services or enhancements our ability to develop acquire or commercialize competitive technologies products or services on acceptable terms or at all may be limited by intellectual property rights that third parties including competitors and potential competitors may assert in addition success is dependent on factors such as partner and customer acceptance adoption and usage competition the effectiveness of marketing programs the availability of appropriate technologies and business processes and regulatory approvals success of a new product service or enhancement also may depend upon our ability to deliver it on a large scale which may require a significant investment we also may select utilize and invest in technologies products and services that ultimately do not achieve widespread adoption and therefore are not as attractive or useful to our partners customers and service partners as we anticipate or partners may not recognize the value of our new products and services or believe they justify any potential costs or disruptions associated with implementing them in addition because our products and services typically are marketed through our partners if our partners are unwilling or unable to effectively implement our new technologies products services or enhancements we may be unable to grow our business competitors may also develop or adopt technologies or introduce innovations that change the markets we operate in and make our products less competitive and attractive to our partners and customers in any event we may not realize the benefit of new technologies products services or enhancements for many years or competitors may introduce more compelling products services or enhancements our failure to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products services or enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we may not realize the value of acquisitions and strategic investments that we pursue and such investments could divert resources or introduce unforeseen risks to our business we will acquire new partners and may execute strategic acquisitions or partnerships or make other strategic investments in businesses products technologies or platforms to enhance or grow our business these acquisitions and strategic investments may introduce new costs or liabilities which could impact our ability to grow or maintain acceptable performance we may be unable to integrate systems personnel or technologies from our acquisitions and strategic investments these acquisitions and strategic investments may also present unforeseen legal regulatory or other challenges that we may not be able to manage effectively the planning and integration of an acquisition including of a new partner or credit card portfolio partnership or investment may shift employee time and other resources which could impair our ability to focus on our core business new partnerships acquisitions and strategic investments may not perform as expected due to lack of acceptance by partners customers or employees higher than forecasted costs or losses lengthy transition periods synergies or savings not being realized and a variety of other factors this may result in a delay or unrealized benefit or in some cases increased costs or other unforeseen risks to our business fraudulent activity associated with our products and services could negatively impact our operating results brand and reputation and cause the use of our products and services to decrease and our fraud losses to increase we are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with partners customers and third parties handling customer information our fraudrelated operational losses were million million and million for the years ended december and respectively our fraudrelated losses have shifted away from counterfeit fraud losses with the implementation of the embedded security chip in dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards and towards application and transactional fraud our products are susceptible to application fraud because among other things we provide immediate access to the credit line at the time of approval in addition sales on the internet and through mobile channels are becoming a larger part of our business and fraudulent activity is higher as a percentage of sales in those channels than in stores dual cards general purpose general purpose cobranded credit cards and private label credit cards are susceptible to different types of fraud and depending on our product channel mix we may continue to experience variations in or levels of fraudrelated expense that are different from or higher than that experienced by some of our competitors or the industry generally the risk of fraud continues to increase for the financial services industry in general and credit card fraud identity theft and related crimes are likely to continue to be prevalent and perpetrators are growing more sophisticated our resources technologies and fraud prevention tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud high profile fraudulent activity also could negatively impact our brand and reputation which could negatively impact the use of our cards and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention such as increased customer notification requirements which could increase our costs and also negatively impact our operating results brand and reputation and could lead us to take steps to reduce fraud risk which could increase our costs the failure of third parties to provide various services that are important to our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations some services important to our business are outsourced to thirdparty vendors for example our credit card transaction processing production and related services including the printing and mailing of customer statements are handled via a contractual arrangement with first data and the technology platform for our online retail deposits is managed by fiserv in fiserv acquired first data first data fiserv and in some cases other thirdparty vendors are the sole source or one of a limited number of sources of the services they provide for us it would be difficult and disruptive for us to replace some of our thirdparty vendors particularly first data and fiserv in a timely manner if they were unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future as a result of their financial or business conditions or otherwise and our business and operations likely would be materially adversely affected our principal agreement with first data expires in november unless it is terminated earlier or is extended pursuant to the terms thereof our principal agreement with fiserv expires in july unless it is terminated earlier or is extended pursuant to the terms thereof in addition if a thirdparty provider fails to provide the services we require fails to meet contractual requirements such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations or suffers a cyberattack or other security breach our business could suffer economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations technological risks cyberattacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business in the normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential information regarding our partners and our customers we also have arrangements in place with our partners and other third parties through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and business continuity programs our facilities and systems and those of our partners and thirdparty service providers are vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events we and our partners and thirdparty service providers have experienced all of these events in the past and expect to continue to experience them in the future these events could interrupt our business or operations result in significant legal and financial exposure supervisory liability damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services although the impact to date from these events has not had a material adverse effect on us we cannot be sure this will be the case in the future information security risks for large financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies including mobile and other connected devices to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime perpetrators of fraud hackers terrorists and others in addition to cyberattacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions that are designed to disrupt key business services such as consumerfacing web sites our business performance and marketing efforts may increase our profile and therefore our risk of being targeted for cyberattacks and other security breaches including attacks targeting our key business services websites executives and partners we are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources we employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection we also face risks related to cyberattacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and deposit transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various thirdparties including our partners retailers that are not our partners where our dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards are used merchant acquiring banks payment processors card networks eg visa and mastercard and our processors eg first data and fiserv some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyberattacks and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure future security breaches or cyberattacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them we also rely on numerous other thirdparty service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them while we regularly conduct security assessments of significant thirdparty service providers we cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach the access by unauthorized persons to or the improper disclosure by us of confidential information regarding our customers or our own proprietary information software methodologies and business secrets could interrupt our business or operations result in significant legal and financial exposure supervisory liability damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition there have been a number of wellpublicized attacks or breaches directed at others in our industry that have heightened concern by consumers generally about the security of using credit cards which have caused some consumers including our customers to use our credit cards less in favor of alternative methods of payment and has led to increased regulatory focus on and potentially new regulations relating to these matters further cyberattacks or other breaches in the future whether affecting us or others could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of our cards or other products and increased costs arising from among other things new regulatory requirements relating to data security all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business disruptions in the operation of our and our outsourced partners computer systems and data centers could have a material adverse effect on our business our ability to deliver products and services to our partners and our customers service our loans and otherwise operate our business and comply with applicable laws depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems and data centers as well as those of our partners and thirdparty service providers these computer systems and data centers may encounter service interruptions at any time due to system or software failure natural disaster or other reasons in addition the implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain current and integrate new systems may also cause service interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause our failure to comply with applicable laws all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business we expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer credit industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies and business processes may be better than those we currently use the pace of technology change is high and our industry is intensely competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete and better ones become available a failure to maintain current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be less competitive all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations financial risks our allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to cover losses on our loans we maintain an allowance for credit losses a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense that we believe is appropriate to provide for expected credit losses for the life of our loan portfolio in addition for portfolios we may acquire when we enter into new partner program agreements we are required to establish at acquisition an allowance for expected credit losses for the life of the acquired loan portfolio any subsequent deterioration in the performance of the purchased portfolios after acquisition results in incremental credit loss reserves growth in our loan portfolio generally would also lead to an increase in the allowance for credit losses the process for establishing an allowance for credit losses is critical to our results of operations and financial condition and requires complex models and judgments including forecasts of economic conditions effective january the company adopted asu financial instrumentscredit losses measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which required us to adopt a new impairment model known as the cecl model the cecl model requires upon origination of a loan the recognition of all expected credit losses over the life of the loan based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding our loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses we may underestimate our expected losses and fail to maintain an allowance for credit losses sufficient to account for these losses in cases where we modify a loan if the modified loans do not perform as anticipated we may be required to establish additional allowances on these loans we will continue to periodically review and update our current methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use to establish our allowance for credit losses to reflect our view of current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts moreover our regulators as part of their supervisory function periodically review our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments we use for calculating and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses our regulators based on their judgment may conclude that we should modify our current methodology models or the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments increase our allowance for credit losses andor recognize further losses we will implement further enhancements or changes to our methodology models and the underlying assumptions estimates and assessments as needed we cannot assure you that our credit loss reserves will be sufficient to cover actual losses future increases in the allowance for credit losses or actual losses as a result of any review update regulatory guidance or otherwise will result in a decrease in net earnings and capital and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if assumptions or estimates we use in preparing our financial statements including those related to the cecl accounting guidance are incorrect or are required to change our reported results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected we are required to make various assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements under gaap including for purposes of determining our allowance for credit losses asset impairment reserves related to litigation and other legal matters valuation of income and other taxes and regulatory exposures and the amounts recorded for certain contractual payments to be paid to or received from partners and others under contractual arrangements our most critical estimate used in preparing our financial statements is the determination of our allowance for credit losses which was billion at december upon origination of a loan the estimate of expected credit losses and any subsequent changes to such estimate are recorded through provision for credit losses in our consolidated statement of earnings as a result any subsequent changes we make to our underlying assumptions and estimates may result in a material adverse impact to our results of operations and the companys ability to return capital to our shareholders in addition significant assumptions and estimates are involved in determining certain disclosures required under gaap including those involving the fair value of our financial instruments if the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect or are required to change the actual amounts realized on transactions and balances subject to those estimates will be different and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition for additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimates and note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements adverse financial market conditions or our inability to effectively manage our funding and liquidity risk could have a material adverse effect on our funding liquidity and ability to meet our obligations we need to effectively manage our funding and liquidity in order to meet our cash requirements such as daytoday operating expenses extensions of credit to our customers payments of principal and interest on our borrowings and payments on our other obligations our primary sources of funding and liquidity are collections from our customers deposits funds from securitized financings and proceeds from unsecured borrowings if we do not have sufficient liquidity we may not be able to meet our obligations particularly during a liquidity stress event if we maintain or are required to maintain too much liquidity it could be costly and reduce our financial flexibility for example at december due to the reduction in loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform we continued to carry a high level of liquidity which resulted in the company holding excess capital and a decrease in our net interest margin for the year ended december we will need additional financing in the future to refinance any existing debt and finance growth of our business the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as financial market conditions generally including the availability of credit to the financial services industry consumers willingness to place money on deposit in the bank our performance and credit ratings and the performance of our securitized portfolios disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital credit or deposit markets such as the uncertainty and volatility experienced in the capital and credit markets during periods of financial stress and other economic and political conditions in the global markets and concerning the level of us government debt and fiscal measures that may be taken over the longer term to address these matters may limit our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance maturing liabilities on desired terms including funding costs in a timely manner or at all as a result we may be forced to delay obtaining funding or be forced to issue or raise funding on undesirable terms which could significantly reduce our financial flexibility and cause us to contract or not grow our business all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions in addition at december we had an aggregate of billion of undrawn credit facilities subject to customary borrowing conditions from private lenders under our securitization programs and an unsecured revolving credit facility our ability to draw on such commitments is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including the applicable securitization trust having sufficient collateral to support the draw and the absence of an early amortization event moreover there are regulatory reforms that have been proposed or adopted in the united states and internationally that are intended to address certain issues that affected banks in the last financial crisis these reforms generally referred to as basel iii subject banks to more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements to the extent that the basel iii requirements result in increased costs to the banks providing undrawn committed capacity under our securitization programs these costs are likely to be passed on to us in addition in response to basel iii some banks in the market including certain of the private lenders in our securitization programs have added provisions to their credit agreements permitting them to delay disbursement of funding requests for days or more if our bank lenders require delayed disbursements of funding andor higher pricing for committing undrawn capacity to us our cost of funding and access to liquidity could be adversely affected while financial market conditions are generally stable there can be no assurance that significant disruptions uncertainties and volatility will not occur in the future if we are unable to continue to finance our business access capital markets and attract deposits on favorable terms and in a timely manner or if we experience an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected our inability to grow our deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to grow our business we obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers or through brokerage firms that offer our deposit products to their customers at december we had billion in direct deposits and billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger who channels brokerage account deposits to us a key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to fund our growth through direct deposits the deposit business is highly competitive with intense competition in attracting and retaining deposits we compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits features and benefits of our products the quality of our customer service and the competitiveness of our digital banking capabilities our ability to originate and maintain retail deposits is also highly dependent on the strength of the bank and the perceptions of consumers and others of our business practices and our financial health adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to difficulties in attracting and retaining deposits accounts negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas including lending practices regulatory compliance inadequate protection of customer information or sales and marketing activities and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct the demand for the deposit products we offer may also be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns changes in customer preferences reductions in consumers disposable income regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of competing products competition from other financial services firms and others that use deposit funding products may affect deposit renewal rates costs or availability changes we make to the rates offered on our deposit products may affect our profitability and liquidity the federal deposit insurance act the fdia prohibits an insured bank from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the banks normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is well capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates there are no such restrictions under the fdia on a bank that is well capitalized and at december the bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well capitalized for purposes of the fdia however there can be no assurance that the bank will continue to meet those requirements limitations on the banks ability to accept brokered deposits for any reason including regulatory limitations on the amount of brokered deposits in total or as a percentage of total assets in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity any limitation on the interest rates the bank can pay on deposits could competitively disadvantage us in attracting and retaining deposits and have a material adverse effect on our business a reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets synchronys senior unsecured debt currently is rated bbb negative outlook by fitch ratings inc fitch and bbb negative outlook by standard poors sp the banks senior unsecured debt currently is rated bbb negative outlook by fitch and bbb negative outlook by sp although we have not requested that moodys investor services inc moodys provide a rating for our senior unsecured debt we believe that if moodys were to issue a rating on our unsecured debt its rating would be lower than the comparable ratings issued by fitch and sp the ratings for our unsecured debt are based on a number of factors including our financial strength as well as factors that may not be within our control such as macroeconomic conditions and the rating agencies perception of the industries in which we operate and the products we offer the ratings of our assetbacked securities are and will continue to be based on a number of factors including the quality of the underlying loan receivables and the credit enhancement structure with respect to each series of assetbacked securities as well as our credit rating as sponsor and servicer of our publicly registered securitization trusts these ratings also reflect the various methodologies and assumptions used by the rating agencies which are subject to change and could adversely affect our ratings the rating agencies regularly evaluate our credit ratings as well as the credit ratings of our assetbacked securities a downgrade in our unsecured debt or assetbacked securities credit ratings or investor concerns that a downgrade may occur could materially increase the cost of our funding from and restrict our access to the capital markets if the ratings on our assetbacked securities are reduced put on negative watch or withdrawn it may have an adverse effect on the liquidity or the market price of our assetbacked securities and on the cost of or our ability to continue using securitized financings to the extent anticipated our inability to securitize our loan receivables would have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity cost of funds and financial condition we use the securitization of loan receivables which involves the transfer of loan receivables to a trust and the issuance by the trust of assetbacked securities to thirdparty investors as a significant source of funding our average level of securitized financings from third parties was billion and billion for the years ended december and respectively for a discussion of our securitization activities see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfunding liquidity and capital resourcesfunding sourcessecuritized financings and note variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that the securitization market for credit cards will not experience future disruptions the extent to which we securitize our loan receivables in the future will depend in part upon the conditions in the securities markets in general and the credit card assetbacked securities market in particular the availability of loan receivables for securitization the overall credit quality of our loan receivables and the conformity of the loan receivables and our securitization program to rating agency requirements the costs of securitizing our loan receivables and the legal regulatory accounting and tax requirements governing securitization transactions in the event we are unable to refinance existing assetbacked securities with new assetbacked securities we would be required to rely on other sources of funding which may not be available or may be available only at higher cost further in the event we are unable to refinance existing assetbacked securities from our nonbank subsidiary securitization trust with new securities from the same trust there are structural and regulatory constraints on our ability to refinance these assetbacked securities with bank deposits or other funding at the bank and therefore we would be required to rely on sources outside of the bank which may not be available or may be available only at higher cost a prolonged inability to securitize our loan receivables on favorable terms or at all or to refinance our assetbacked securities would have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity cost of funds and financial condition the occurrence of an early amortization of our securitization facilities would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds our liquidity would be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of events resulting in the early amortization of our existing securitized financings during an early amortization period principal collections from the loan receivables in our assetbacked securitization trust in which the early amortization event occurred would be applied to repay principal of the trusts assetbacked securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund purchases of newly originated loan receivables this would negatively impact our liquidity including our ability to originate new loan receivables under existing accounts and require us to rely on alternative funding sources which might increase our funding costs or might not be available when needed our loss of the right to service or subservice our securitized loan receivables would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cost of funds synchrony currently acts as servicer with respect to our nonbank subsidiary securitization trust and the bank acts as servicer with respect to our other two securitization trusts if synchrony or the bank as applicable defaults in its servicing obligations an early amortization event could occur with respect to the relevant assetbacked securities andor synchrony or the bank as applicable could be replaced as servicer servicer defaults include for example the failure of the servicer to make any payment transfer or deposit in accordance with the securitization documents a breach of representations warranties or agreements made by the servicer under the securitization documents the delegation of the servicers duties contrary to the securitization documents and the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the servicer such an early amortization event would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor if either synchrony or the bank defaults in its servicing obligations with respect to any of our three securitization trusts a third party could be appointed as servicer of such trust if a thirdparty servicer is appointed there is no assurance that the third party will engage us as subservicer in which event we would no longer be able to control the manner in which the related trusts assets are serviced and the failure of a third party to appropriately service such assets could lead to an early amortization event in the affected securitization trust which would have the adverse consequences discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor lower payment rates on our securitized loan receivables could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition certain collections from our securitized loan receivables come back to us through our subsidiaries and we use these collections to fund our purchase of newly originated loan receivables to collateralize our securitized financings if payment rates on our securitized loan receivables are lower than they have historically been fewer collections will be remitted to us on an ongoing basis further certain series of our assetbacked securities include a requirement that we accumulate principal collections in a restricted account for a specified number of months prior to the applicable securitys maturity date we are required under the program documents to lengthen this accumulation period to the extent we expect the payment rates to be low enough that the current length of the accumulation period is inadequate to fully fund the restricted account by the applicable securitys maturity date lower payment rates and in particular payment rates that are low enough that we are required to lengthen our accumulation periods could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings funding and liquidity changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease as certain of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks at december of our loan receivables were priced at a fixed interest rate to the customer with the remaining at a floating interest rate we fund our assets with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits assetbacked securities and unsecured debt the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is the prime rate and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either the libor or the federal funds rate the prime rate and libor or the federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities additionally on july the uk financial conduct authority announced that it would no longer encourage or compel banks to continue to contribute quotes and maintain libor after there is no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or of any particular replacement rate to the extent we are unable to position the balance sheet naturally or using derivatives to effectively match the interest rates on our assets and liabilities or are unable to effectively manage any transition from libor to a replacement rate or rates our net earnings could be materially adversely affected competitive and regulatory factors may limit our ability to raise interest rates on our loans in addition some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers if interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely manner or at all our net interest margin could be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings interest rates may also adversely impact our customers spending levels and ability and willingness to pay amounts owed to us our floating rate credit products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies bankruptcies chargeoffs allowances for credit losses and decreasing recoveries all of which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us and reductions in deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the net interest income impact of various interest rate scenarios we take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our net earnings and could also increase our funding costs and reduce our liquidity especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different from our assumptions for a discussion of interest rate risk sensitivities see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate risk we rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business and if they are not accurate or are misinterpreted it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we rely extensively on models in managing many aspects of our business including liquidity and capital planning including stress testing customer selection credit and other risk management pricing reserving and collections management the models may prove in practice to be less predictive than we expect for a variety of reasons including as a result of errors in constructing interpreting or using the models or the use of inaccurate assumptions including failures to update assumptions appropriately or in a timely manner our assumptions may be inaccurate for many reasons including that they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and beyond our control eg macroeconomic conditions and their impact on partner and customer behaviors and they often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables factors and other assumptions the errors or inaccuracies in our models may be material and could lead us to make wrong or suboptimal decisions in managing our business and this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our business depends on our ability to successfully manage our credit risk and failing to do so may result in high chargeoff rates our success depends on our ability to manage our credit risk while attracting new customers with profitable usage patterns we select our customers manage their accounts and establish terms and credit limits using proprietary scoring models and other analytical techniques that are designed to set terms and credit limits to appropriately compensate us for the credit risk we accept while encouraging customers to use their available credit the models and approaches we use to manage our credit risk may not accurately predict future chargeoffs for various reasons discussed in the preceding risk factors our ability to manage credit risk and avoid high chargeoff rates also may be adversely affected by economic conditions that may be difficult to predict such as the last financial crisis the assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix account maturation as well as broader consumer trends such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness see managements discussion and analysisresults of operationsbusiness trends and conditions for further discussion of our expectations of future credit trends in the near term credit trends may deteriorate materially from our expectations if economic conditions were to deteriorate in addition we remain subject to conditions in the consumer credit environment our credit underwriting and risk management strategies are used to manage our credit exposures however there can be no assurance that those will enable us to avoid high chargeoff levels or delinquencies or that our allowance for credit losses will be sufficient to cover actual losses a customers ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by increases in their payment obligations to other lenders under mortgage credit card and other loans including student loans these changes can result from increases in base lending rates or structured increases in payment obligations and could reduce the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations to other lenders and to us in addition a customers ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by the restricted availability of credit to consumers generally including reduced and closed lines of credit customers with insufficient cash flow to fund daily living expenses and lack of access to other sources of credit may be more likely to increase their card usage and ultimately default on their payment obligations to us resulting in higher credit losses in our portfolio our collection operations may not compete effectively to secure more of customers diminished cash flow than our competitors we may not identify customers who are likely to default on their payment obligations to us and reduce our exposure by closing credit lines and restricting authorizations quickly enough which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition our collection strategy depends in part on the sale of debt to thirdparty buyers regulatory or other factors may adversely affect the pricing of our debt sales or the performance of our thirdparty buyers which may result in higher credit losses in our portfolio at december of our portfolios loan receivables were from customers with a vantage score of or less excluding unrated accounts who typically have higher delinquency and credits losses than consumers with higher credit scores our ability to manage credit risk also may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory changes such as bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations and collection regulations competitors actions and consumer behavior as well as inadequate collections staffing techniques models and performance of vendors such as collection agencies we may not be able to offset increases in our costs with decreased payments under our retailer share arrangements which could reduce our profitability most of our retail card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the relevant program exceeds a contractually defined threshold although the share arrangements vary by partner these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program based typically on agreed upon program revenues including interest income and certain other income less agreed upon program expenses including interest expense provision for credit losses retailer payments and operating expenses and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold these arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold however because the threshold and the economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on among other things agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses we may not be able to pass on increases in our actual expenses such as funding costs or operating expenses in the form of reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements and our economic return on a program could be adversely affected while most of our agreements contain retailer share arrangements in some cases where we instead provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts for example on our cobranded credit cards our ability to offset increases in our costs is limited reductions in interchange fees may reduce the competitive advantages our private label credit card products currently have by virtue of not charging interchange fees and would reduce our income from those fees interchange is a fee merchants pay to the interchange network in exchange for the use of the networks infrastructure and payment facilitation and which are paid to credit card issuers to compensate them for the risk they bear in lending money to customers we earn interchange fees on dual card and general purpose cobranded credit card transactions but we typically do not charge or earn interchange fees from our partners or customers on our private label credit card products merchants trying to decrease their operating expenses have sought to and have had some success at lowering interchange rates several recent events and actions indicate a continuing increase in focus on interchange by both regulators and merchants beyond pursuing litigation legislation and regulation merchants are also pursuing alternate payment platforms as a means to lower payment processing costs to the extent interchange fees are reduced one of our current competitive advantages with our partnersthat we typically do not charge interchange fees when our private label credit card products are used to purchase our partners goods and servicesmay be reduced moreover to the extent interchange fees are reduced our income from those fees will be lower we received million of interchange fees for the year ended december as a result a reduction in interchange fees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition for our dual cards and general purpose cobranded credit cards we are subject to the operating regulations and procedures set forth by the interchange network and our failure to comply with these operating regulations which may change from time to time could subject us to various penalties or fees or the termination of our license to use the interchange network all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations legal risks we have international operations that subject us to various international risks as well as increased compliance and regulatory risks and costs we have international operations primarily in india the philippines and canada and some of our thirdparty service providers provide services to us from other countries all of which subject us to a number of international risks including among other things sovereign volatility and sociopolitical instability for example the philippines has in the past experienced severe political and social instability any future political or social instability in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business operations us regulations also govern various aspects of the international activities of domestic corporations and increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs any failure on our part or the part of our service providers to comply with applicable us regulations as well as the regulations in the countries and markets in which we or they operate could result in fines penalties injunctions or other similar restrictions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we are alleged to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights owned by others or are not able to protect our intellectual property our business and results of operations could be adversely affected competitors or other third parties may allege that we or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us infringe on their intellectual property rights we also may face allegations that our employees have misappropriated intellectual property of their former employers or other third parties given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual propertyrelated litigation an assertion of an infringement claim against us may cause us to spend significant amounts to defend the claim even if we ultimately prevail pay significant money damages lose significant revenues be prohibited from using the relevant systems processes technologies or other intellectual property cease offering certain products or services or incur significant license royalty or technology development expenses moreover it has become common in recent years for individuals and groups to purchase intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees in addition although in some cases a third party may have agreed to indemnify us for such costs such indemnifying party may refuse or be unable to uphold its contractual obligations moreover we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information including copyrights trademarks patents trade secrets and controls on access and distribution these measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage and in any event we may be required to litigate to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information from misappropriation or infringement by others which is expensive could cause a diversion of resources and may not be successful third parties may challenge invalidate or circumvent our intellectual property or our intellectual property may not be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages our competitors or other third parties may independently design around or develop similar technology or otherwise duplicate our services or products such that we could not assert our intellectual property rights against them in addition our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of an unauthorized disclosure litigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses our business is subject to increased risks of litigation and regulatory actions as a result of a number of factors and from various sources including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry and the structure of the credit card industry in the normal course of business from time to time we have been named as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our business activities certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in addition while historically the arbitration provision in our customer agreements generally has limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future there may also be legislative or other efforts to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of predispute arbitration clauses or we may be compelled as a result of competitive pressure or reputational concerns to voluntarily eliminate predispute arbitration clauses if the arbitration provision is not enforceable or eliminated for whatever reason our exposure to class action litigation could increase significantly we are also involved from time to time in reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental agencies regarding our business collectively regulatory matters which could subject us to significant fines penalties obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses diminished earnings and damage to our reputation the current environment of additional regulation increased regulatory compliance efforts and enhanced regulatory enforcement has resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may prevent or make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services there is no assurance that these regulatory matters or other factors will not in the future affect how we conduct our business and in turn have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we contest liability andor the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter the outcome of pending and future matters could be material to our results of operations financial condition and cash flows depending on among other factors the level of our earnings for that period and could adversely affect our business and reputation for a discussion of certain legal proceedings see regulationconsumer financial services regulation and note legal proceedings and regulatory matters to our consolidated financial statements in addition to litigation and regulatory matters from time to time through our operational and compliance controls we identify compliance issues that require us to make operational changes and depending on the nature of the issue result in financial remediation to impacted cardholders these selfidentified issues and voluntary remediation payments could be significant depending on the issue and the number of cardholders impacted they also could generate litigation or regulatory investigations that subject us to additional adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition general risks damage to our reputation could negatively impact our business maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and retaining customers partners investors and employees in particular adverse perceptions regarding our reputation could also make it more difficult for us to execute on our strategy of increasing retail deposits at the bank and may lead to decreases in deposits harm to our reputation can arise from many sources including employee misconduct misconduct by our partners outsourced service providers or other counterparties litigation or regulatory actions failure by us or our partners to meet minimum standards of service and quality inadequate protection of customer information and compliance failures negative publicity regarding us or others engaged in a similar business or activities whether or not accurate may damage our reputation which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our risk management processes and procedures may not be effective in mitigating our risks our risk management processes and procedures seek to appropriately balance risk and return and mitigate risks we have established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor and control the types of risk to which we are subject including credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk including compliance risk strategic risk and reputational risk credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of an obligation we are exposed to both consumer credit risk from our customer loans and institutional credit risk principally from our partners market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet obligations and support business growth operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes people or systems external events ie natural disasters or compliance reputational or legal matters and includes those risks as they relate directly to us as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business strategic risk is the risk from changes in the business environment improper implementation of decisions or inadequate responsiveness to changes in the business environment reputational risk is the risk arising from negative perception on the part of customers counterparties shareholders investors rating agencies regulators and employees that can adversely affect the companys ability to maintain existing talent and customers and establish new business relationships with continued access to sources of funding see our businesscredit risk management and risksrisk management for additional information on the types of risks affecting our business we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework that includes our risk appetite statement enterprise risk assessment era process risk policies procedures and controls reporting requirements and corporate culture and values in conjunction with the risk management accountability incorporated into our integrated risk management framework which includes our governance structure and three distinct lines of defense management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models if the models that we use to manage these risks are ineffective at predicting future losses or are otherwise inadequate we may incur unexpected losses or otherwise be adversely affected in addition the information we use in managing our credit and other risk may be inaccurate or incomplete as a result of error or fraud both of which may be difficult to detect and avoid there may also be risks that exist or that develop in the future that we have not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated including when processes are changed or new products and services are introduced if our risk management framework does not effectively identify and control our risks we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected and that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and motivate key officers and employees our success depends in large part on our ability to retain recruit and motivate key officers and employees our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace competition for senior executives in the financial services and payment industry is intense we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel guidelines issued by the federal banking regulators prohibits our payment of excessive compensation or compensation that could lead to our material financial loss to our executives employees and directors in addition proposed rules implementing the executive compensation provisions of the doddfrank act would limit the type and structure of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our senior executives and persons deemed significant risktakers these restrictions could negatively impact our ability to compete with other companies in recruiting retaining and motivating key personnel failure to retain talented senior leadership could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we operate in multiple jurisdictions and we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions from time to time legislative initiatives may be proposed which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our deferred tax assets tax positions andor our tax liabilities in addition us federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our historical tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in defending our positions in connection with any such challenge state sales tax rules and regulations and their application and interpretation by the respective states could change and adversely affect our results of operations state sales tax rules and regulations and their application and interpretation by the respective states could adversely affect our results of operations retailers collect sales tax from retail customers and remit those collections to the applicable states when customers fail to repay their loans including the amount of sales tax advanced by us to the merchant on their behalf we are entitled in some cases to seek a refund of the amount of sales tax from the applicable state sales tax laws and regulations enacted by the various states are subject to interpretation and our compliance with such laws is routinely subject to audit and review by the states audit risk is concentrated in several states and these states are conducting ongoing audits the outcomes of ongoing and any future audits and changes in the states interpretation of the sales tax laws and regulations involving the recovery of tax on bad debts could materially adversely impact our results of operations see regulationrisk factors relating to regulation on page for additional risk factors risk management                                                                                              strong risk management is at the core of our business strategy and we have developed processes to manage the major categories of risk namely credit market liquidity operational including compliance strategic risk and reputational risk considered across all risk types as described in greater detail below under risk management roles and responsibilities we manage enterprise risk using an integrated framework that includes boardlevel oversight administration by a group of crossfunctional management committees and daytoday implementation by a dedicated risk management team led by the chief risk officer cro we also utilize the three lines of defense risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk the risk committee of the board of directors has responsibility for the oversight of the risk management program and three other board committees have other oversight roles with respect to risk management several management committees and subcommittees have important roles and responsibilities in administering the risk management program including the enterprise risk management committee the ermc the management committee the mc the asset and liability management committee the alco and the capital management committee the cmc this committeefocused governance structure provides a forum through which risk expertise is applied cross functionally to all major decisions including development of policies processes and controls used by the cro and risk management team to execute the risk management philosophy the enterprise risk management philosophy is to ensure that all relevant risks are appropriately identified measured monitored and controlled the approach in executing this philosophy focuses on leveraging risk expertise to drive enterprise risk management using a strong governance framework structure a comprehensive enterprise risk assessment program and an effective risk appetite framework risk categories risk management is organized around six major risk categories credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk including compliance strategic risk and reputational risk we evaluate the potential impact of a risk event on us including subsidiaries by assessing the partner and customer financial reputational and legal and regulatory impacts credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of a contract andor the underlying collateral is insufficient to satisfy the obligation credit risk includes exposure to consumer credit risk from customer loans as well as institutional credit risk principally from our partners consumer credit risk is one of our most significant risks see our businesscredit risk management for a description of the customer credit risk management procedures market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices rates indices correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio the principal market risk exposures arise from volatility in interest rates and their impact on economic value capitalization levels and earnings market risk is managed by the alco and is subject to policy and risk appetite limits on sensitivity of both earnings at risk and the economic value of equity market risk metrics are reviewed by alco monthly the risk committee on a quarterly basis and the board of directors as required liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that an institutions financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by a real or perceived inability to meet contractual obligations and support planned growth the primary liquidity objective is to maintain a liquidity profile that will enable us even in times of stress or market disruption to fund our existing assets and meet liabilities in a timely manner and at an acceptable cost policy and risk appetite limits require us and the bank and other entities within our business as applicable to ensure that sufficient liquid assets are available to survive liquidity stresses over a specified time period our risk appetite statement requires funding diversification monitoring early warning indicators in the capital markets and other related limits alco reviews liquidity exposures continuously in the context of approved policy and risk appetite limits and reports results quarterly to the risk committee and the board of directors as required

that have been taking effect over several years or have been revised since their initial adoption on may the president signed into law the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act egrrcpa which amended the doddfrank act and modified certain postcrisis regulatory requirements on october the federal reserve board occ and fdic issued final rules which we refer to as the tailoring rules that tailor the applicability of the federal reserve boards enhanced prudential standards relating to capital liquidity and other risk management matters and apply certain of these standards to savings and loan holding companies other than those substantially engaged in insurance underwriting or commercial activities that have total consolidated assets of billion or more based on the average of the previous four quarters referred to as covered savings and loan holding companies synchrony had average total consolidated assets of billion for the four quarters ended december and less than billion in total consolidated assets for each of those quarters as a result synchrony is not currently subject to most of the enhanced prudential standards under the tailoring rules however synchronys average total consolidated assets have exceeded billion in the past and may exceed such threshold again in future periods if in the future synchrony has average total consolidated assets of billion or more based on a four quarter average it will become subject to enhanced prudential standards following applicable transition periods the ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act as well as the recent and possible future changes to the regulatory framework applicable to synchrony and the bank make it difficult to assess the overall financial impact of the doddfrank act and related regulatory developments on us and across the industry see also regulationrisk factors relating to regulationthe doddfrank act and other legislative and regulatory developments have had and may continue to have a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations savings and loan holding company regulation overview as a savings and loan holding company we are required to register

of financial strength for any insured depository institution that we control such as the bank capital as a savings and loan holding company synchrony is subject to capital requirements the following are the minimum capital ratios to which synchrony is subject under the basel iii standardized approach a common equity tier capital to riskweighted assets ratio of the minimum of plus a capital conservation buffer of a tier capital to riskweighted assets ratio of the minimum of plus a capital conservation buffer of and a total capital to riskweighted assets ratio of a minimum of plus a

legislative and regulatory developments for additional information under the tailoring rules most covered savings and loan holding companies with average total consolidated assets of billion or more but less than billion are subject to supervisory stress tests on a biennial basis in even calendar years if in the future synchrony has average total consolidated assets of billion or more based on a four quarter average it will become subject to these stress tests following a transition period of at least five quarters additionally under a final rule issued on january the federal reserve board has subjected covered savings and loan holding companies with average total consolidated assets of billion or more to a stress capital buffer in lieu of the capital conservation buffer the stress capital buffer is calculated as the amount of loss of common equity tier capital incurred by the company in the severely adverse scenario of the most recent supervisory stress test exercise assuming certain continued payments on capital instruments and is subject to a floor of of riskweighted assets if in the future synchrony has average total consolidated assets of billion or more based on a four quarter average it will become subject to the stress capital buffer and as a result its capital requirements may increase and its ability to pay dividends make other capital distributions or redeem or repurchase its stock may be adversely impacted see legislative and regulatory developments for additional information dividends and stock repurchases we are limited in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock by the federal reserve board including on the basis that doing so would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice where we intend to declare or pay a dividend or repurchase our stock we are expected to inform and consult with the federal reserve board in advance to ensure that such dividend or repurchase does not raise supervisory concerns it is the policy of the federal reserve board that a savings and loan holding company like us should generally pay dividends on common stock and preferred stock out of earnings and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the companys capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition according to guidance from the federal reserve board our dividend policies will be assessed against among other things our ability to achieve applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements if we do not achieve applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements we may not be able to pay dividends although we currently expect to meet applicable basel iii capital ratio requirements inclusive of the capital conservation buffer we cannot be sure that we will meet those requirements or that even if we do if we will be able to pay dividends in evaluating the appropriateness of a proposed redemption or repurchase of stock the federal reserve board will consider among other things the potential loss that we may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets as a result of continued asset deterioration and our ability to raise additional common equity and other capital to replace the stock that will be redeemed or repurchased the federal reserve board also will consider the potential negative effects on our capital structure of replacing common stock with any lowertier form of regulatory capital issued moreover regulatory review of any capital plan we are currently required to submit could result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions see regulation risk factors relating to regulationfailure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us and we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness under a final rule issued on january the federal reserve board has subjected covered savings and loan holding companies with average total consolidated assets of billion or more to formal capital plan submission requirements if in the future synchrony has average total consolidated assets of billion or more based on a four quarter average it will become subject to formal capital plan submission requirements and as a result its capital requirements may increase and its ability to pay dividends make other capital distributions or redeem or repurchase its stock may be adversely impacted see legislative and regulatory developments for additional information liquidity under the tailoring rules covered savings and loan holding companies with average total consolidated assets of billion or more must comply with enhanced prudential standards with respect to liquidity management including maintaining diversified liquidity buffers and regularly conducting liquidity stress tests if in the future synchrony has average total consolidated assets of

direct or indirect holding company and a nonbank subsidiary of such a holding company restrictions in sections and of the federal reserve act apply to covered transactions such as extensions of credit issuances of guarantees or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit made by the insured depository institution to an affiliate must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and that the aggregate amount of covered transactions is limited as to any one affiliate of the bank to of the banks capital stock and surplus and as to all of the banks affiliates in the aggregate to of the banks capital stock and surplus in addition transactions between the bank and its affiliates must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered by the bank to nonaffiliated companies ie at arms length the cra is a federal law that generally requires an insured depository institution to identify the communities it serves and to make loans and investments offer products and provide services in each case designed to meet the credit needs of these communities the cra also requires an institution to maintain comprehensive records of cra activities to demonstrate how it is meeting the credit needs of communities these records are subject to periodic examination by the responsible federal banking agency of the institution based on these examinations the agency rates the institutions compliance with cra as outstanding satisfactory needs to improve or substantial noncompliance the cra requires the agency to take into account the record of an institution in meeting the credit needs of the entire communities served including low and moderate income neighborhoods in determining such rating failure of an institution to receive at least a satisfactory rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities including acquisitions the bank is currently designated as a limited purpose bank under the cra and therefore is generally evaluated on the basis of its community development activity in the geographies in which its physical facilities are located the bank received a cra rating of outstanding as of its most recent cra examination on may the occ issued a final rule to revise its regulations governing the cra among other things the final rule requires a bank including a limited purpose bank that receives percent or more of its retail domestic deposits from outside the geographies in which its physical facilities are located to designate additional assessment areas beyond those geographies beginning in we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the final rule on the bank the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the banks normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is wellcapitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is adequately capitalized and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates there are no such restrictions under the fdia on a bank that is wellcapitalized further undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations at december the bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed wellcapitalized for purposes of the fdia an inability to accept brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity on december the fdic issued a final rule to revise and clarify its framework for classifying deposits as brokered deposits including the standards for determining whether a person is a deposit broker and satisfies the primary purpose exemption from that definition we do not believe the final rule will have a material impact on the bank deposit insurance the fdia requires the bank to pay deposit insurance assessments deposit insurance assessments are affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the federal deposit insurance fund the dif the doddfrank act increased the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the dif to and removed the statutory cap on the reserve ratio the fdic subsequently adopted a designated

the extent of such assets first secured creditors to the extent of their security second the administrative expenses of the receivership third all deposits liabilities both insured and uninsured fourth any other general or senior liabilities fifth any obligations subordinated to depositors or general creditors and finally any remaining net assets to shareholders in that capacity resolution planning under fdic regulationsan insured depository institution with billion or more in total assets is required annually to submit to the fdic a plan for the institutions resolution in the event of

receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institutions failure two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than friday maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of the institutions assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in the resolution the resolution plan requirement is intended to ensure that the fdic has access to all of the material information it needs to resolve a large insured depository institution efficiently in the event of its failure on april the fdic sought comment on revisions to the resolution plan requirement including its applicability and announced that no institution will be required to submit a resolution plan until the agency has finalized such revisions on january the

of proposed rulemaking that would require a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator within hours of a significant cybersecurity incident we have a program to comply with applicable privacy information security and data protection requirements imposed by federal state and foreign laws including the glba however if we experience a significant cybersecurity incident or

stress test exercise assuming certain continued payments on capital instruments and is subject to a floor of of riskweighted assets if in the future synchrony has average total consolidated assets of billion or more based on a four quarter average it will become subject to formal capital plan submission requirements and the stress capital buffer and as a result its capital requirements may increase and its ability to pay dividends make other capital distributions or redeem or repurchase its stock may be impacted risk factors relating to regulation

results of operations and financial condition our business including our relationships with our customers is subject to regulation supervision and examination under us federal state and foreign laws and regulations these laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business including lending and collection practices treatment of our customers safeguarding deposits customer privacy and information security capital structure liquidity dividends and other capital distributions transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel as a savings and loan holding company and financial holding company synchrony is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the federal reserve board as a large provider of consumer financial services we are also subject to regulation supervision and examination by the cfpb the bank is a federally chartered savings association as such the bank is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the occ which is its primary regulator and by the cfpb in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is supervised by the fdic we including the bank are regularly reviewed and examined by our respective regulators which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require response and attention see regulation for more information about the regulations applicable to us banking laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect federally insured deposits the dif and the banking system as a whole and not intended to protect our stockholders noteholders or creditors if we fail to satisfy applicable laws and regulations our respective regulators have broad discretion to enforce those laws and regulations including with respect to the operation of our business required capital levels payment of dividends and other capital distributions engaging in certain activities and making acquisitions and investments our regulators also have broad discretion with respect to the enforcement of applicable laws and regulations including through enforcement actions that could subject us to civil money penalties customer remediation programs increased compliance costs and limits or prohibitions on our ability to offer certain products and services or to engage in certain activities in addition to the extent we undertake actions requiring regulatory approval or nonobjection our regulators may make their approval or nonobjection subject to conditions or restrictions that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition any other actions taken by our regulators could also have a material adverse impact on our business reputation and brand results of operations and financial condition moreover some of our competitors are subject to different and in some cases less restrictive statutory andor regulatory regimes which may have the effect of providing them with a competitive advantage over us new laws regulations policies or practical changes in enforcement of existing laws regulations or policies applicable to our business or our own reexamination of our current practices could adversely impact our profitability limit our ability to continue existing or pursue new business activities require us to change certain of our business practices or alter our relationships with customers affect retention of our key personnel or expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs andor customer remediation these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition for example the cfpb has broad authority over our business see there continues to be uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureaus actions will impact our business the agencys actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business we are also subject to potential enforcement and other actions that may be brought by state attorneys general or other state enforcement authorities and other governmental agencies any such actions could subject us to civil money penalties and fines customer remediation programs and increased compliance costs as well as damage our reputation and brand and limit or prohibit our ability to offer certain products and services or engage in certain business practices for a discussion of risks related to actions or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies see risk factors relating to our businesslitigation regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments remediation costs andor requirements resulting in increased expenses the doddfrank act and other legislative and regulatory developments have had and may continue to have a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations the doddfrank act and regulations promulgated thereunder have had and may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition for example the doddfrank act and related regulations restrict certain business practices impose more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements as well as additional costs including increased compliance costs and increased costs of funding raised through the issuance of assetbacked securities on us and impact the value of our assets in addition the doddfrank act requires us to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution we control such as the bank such support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interest of synchrony or its stockholders noteholders or creditors we describe certain provisions of the doddfrank act and other legislative and regulatory developments in regulationregulation relating to our business the egrrcpa and related regulatory reform initiatives including the tailoring rules have modified many of the doddfrank acts requirements that apply to us while certain aspects of these legislative and regulatory changes reduce regulatory burdens for us other aspects including the application of enhanced prudential standards formal capital plan submission requirements and the stress capital buffer to large covered savings and loan holding companies would impose additional requirements and constraints on us if in the future we had average total consolidated assets of billion or more based on a four quarter average and additional rulemaking may impose new capital requirements and limitations on our ability to pay dividends or redeem or repurchase our stock further the ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act as well as the recent and possible future changes to the regulatory framework applicable to synchrony and the bank and additional rulemaking make it difficult to assess the overall financial impact of the doddfrank act and related regulatory developments on us and across the industry there is ongoing uncertainty as to how the consumer financial protection bureaus actions will impact our business the agencys actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business the cfpb has broad authority over our business this includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions such as us for compliance the cfpb is authorized to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices through its regulatory supervisory and enforcement authority the federal reserve board and the occ and state government agencies may also invoke their supervisory and enforcement authorities to prevent unfair and deceptive acts or practices these federal and state agencies are authorized to remediate violations of consumer protection laws in a number of ways including collecting civil money penalties and fines and providing for customer restitution the cfpb also engages in consumer financial education requests data and promotes the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities in addition the cfpb maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products including the products we offer this system could inform future cfpb decisions with respect to its regulatory enforcement or examination focus there is ongoing uncertainty as to how the cfpbs strategies and priorities including in both its examination and enforcement processes will impact our business and our results of operations going forward actions by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services including deferred interest products making them less attractive to consumers and less profitable to us and also restricting our ability to offer them in addition since the bank has entered into two consent orders with the cfpb one in the cfpb consent order which required us to provide remediation to certain customers and to make a number of changes to our carecredit training sales marketing and servicing practices and another in together with the consent order the consent orders with respect to a debt cancellation product and sales practices and an unrelated issue that arose from the banks selfidentified omission of certain spanishspeaking customers and customers residing in puerto rico from two offers that were made to certain delinquent customers the banks resolutions with the cfpb do not preclude other regulators or state attorneys general from seeking additional monetary or injunctive relief with respect to carecredit and any such relief could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition although we have committed significant resources to enhancing our compliance programs changes by the cfpb in regulatory expectations interpretations or practices or interpretations that are different or stricter than ours or those adopted in the past by other regulators could increase the risk of additional enforcement actions fines and penalties in recent years the cfpb has identified certain areas of concern for consumers including for example deferred interest products subprime specialist credit card issuers and unexpected rate increases with respect to variable interest rate products actions by the cfpb with respect to these or other areas could result in requirements to alter our products and services that may make them less attractive to consumers or less profitable to us future actions by the cfpb or other regulators against us or our competitors that discourage the use of products we offer or suggest to consumers the desirability of other products or services could result in reputational harm and a loss of customers if the cfpb changes regulations which it adopted in the past or which were adopted in the past by other regulators and transferred to the cfpb by the doddfrank act or modifies through supervision or enforcement past related regulatory guidance or interprets existing regulations in a different or stricter manner than they have been interpreted in the past by us the industry or other regulators our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase materially if future regulatory or legislative restrictions or prohibitions are imposed that affect our ability to offer promotional financing including deferred interest for certain of our products or require us to make significant changes to our business practices and we are unable to develop compliant alternatives with acceptable returns these restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition the doddfrank act authorizes state officials to enforce regulations issued by the cfpb and to enforce the acts general prohibition against unfair deceptive or abusive practices this could make it more difficult than in the past for federal financial regulators to declare state laws that differ from federal standards to be preempted to the extent that states enact requirements that differ from federal standards or state officials and courts adopt interpretations of federal consumer laws that differ from those adopted by the cfpb we may be required to alter or cease offering products or services in some jurisdictions which would increase compliance costs and reduce our ability to offer the same products and services to consumers nationwide and we may be subject to a higher risk of state enforcement actions failure by synchrony and the bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us synchrony and the bank must meet rules for capital adequacy as discussed in regulationregulation relating to our business as a standalone savings and loan holding company synchrony is subject to capital requirements similar to those that apply to the bank synchrony and the bank may be subject to increasingly stringent capital adequacy standards in the future for instance if in the future synchrony has billion or more in average total consolidated assets based on a four quarter average synchrony will become subject to biennial supervisory stress tests a formal capital plan submission requirement and the stress capital buffer see regulationregulation relating to our business savings and loan holding company regulationcapital and regulationregulation relating to our business savings and loan holding company regulationdividends and stock repurchases while synchrony had less than billion in average total consolidated assets as of december and less than billion in total consolidated assets in each of the four quarters ending as of december its average total consolidated assets have exceeded billion in the past and may exceed such threshold again in future periods if synchrony becomes subject to supervisory stress tests a formal capital plan submission requirement andor the stress capital buffer synchrony could be subject to additional restrictions on its ability to return capital to shareholders additionally asu financial instrumentscredit losses measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which implements cecl as a new impairment model based on expected credit losses requires us to recognize all expected credit losses over the life of a loan based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts see note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies new accounting standards to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the new accounting standard for credit losses and its impact to the companys allowance for credit losses if synchrony or the bank fails to meet current or future minimum capital leverage or other financial requirements its operations results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected among other things failure by synchrony or the bank to maintain its status as well capitalized or otherwise meet current or future minimum capital leverage or other financial requirements could compromise our competitive position and result in restrictions imposed by the federal reserve board or the occ including potentially on the banks ability to engage in certain activities these could include restrictions on the banks ability to enter into transactions with affiliates accept brokered deposits grow its assets engage in material transactions extend credit in certain highly leveraged transactions amend or change its charter bylaws or accounting methods pay interest on its liabilities without regard to regulatory caps on the rates that may be paid on deposits and pay dividends or repurchase stock in addition failure to maintain the well capitalized status of the bank could result in our having to invest additional capital in the bank which could in turn require us to raise additional capital the market and demand for and cost of our asset backed securities also could be adversely affected by failure to meet current or future capital requirements synchrony must also continue to comply with regulatory requirements related to the maintenance management monitoring and reporting of liquidity as discussed in regulationregulation relating to our business under the tailoring rules enhanced prudential standards with respect to liquidity management apply to covered savings and loan holding companies with billion or more in average total consolidated assets see regulation regulation relating to our businesslegislative and regulatory developments if such requirements apply to us in the future we cannot predict their effects on us we are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock the bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us which could limit our ability to pay dividends repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness we are limited in our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock by the federal reserve board which has broad authority to review our capital planning and risk management processes and our current projected and stressed capital levels and to object to any capital action that the federal reserve board considers to be unsafe or unsound in addition the declaration and amount of any future dividends to holders of our common stock or stock repurchases will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on many factors including the financial condition earnings capital and liquidity of us and the bank applicable regulatory requirements corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant if we are unable to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perceptions of synchrony financial see regulationregulation relating to our businesssavings and loan holding company regulationdividends and stock repurchases we rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the bank for liquidity including to pay our obligations under our indebtedness and other indebtedness as they become due and federal law limits the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the bank may pay to us for example occ regulations limit the ability of savings associations to make distributions of capital including payment of dividends stock redemptions and repurchases cashout mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account the bank must obtain the occs approval prior to making a capital distribution in certain circumstances including if the bank proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet certain capital requirements or will not do so as a result of the proposed capital distribution or certain net income requirements in addition the bank must file a prior written notice of a planned or declared dividend or other distribution with the federal reserve board the federal reserve board or the occ may object to a capital distribution if among other things the bank is or as a result of such dividend or distribution would be undercapitalized or the federal reserve board or occ has safety and soundness concerns additional restrictions on bank dividends may apply if the bank fails the qtl test the application of these restrictions on the banks ability to pay dividends involves broad discretion on the part of our regulators limitations on the banks payments of dividends and other distributions and payments that we receive from the bank could reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to pay dividends or our obligations under our indebtedness see regulation regulation relating to our businesssavings association regulationdividends and stock repurchases and activities regulations relating to privacy information security and data protection could increase our costs affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities we are subject to various privacy information security and data protection laws including requirements concerning security breach notification and we could be negatively impacted by them for example in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to the glba and implementing regulations and guidance among other things the glba i imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties ii requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to opt out of the institutions disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties with certain exceptions and iii requires financial institutions to develop implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institutions size and complexity the nature and scope of the financial institutions activities and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches moreover various united states federal banking regulatory agencies states and foreign jurisdictions have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual consumer regulatory andor law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach many of these requirements also apply broadly to our partners that accept our cards in many countries that have yet to impose data security breach notification requirements regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data security breaches
