surcharge enhanced supplementary leverage ratio or additional single counterparty credit limits longterm debt and clean holding company requirements in the summer of the us banking regulators proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with billion or more in total assets to comply with longterm debt requirements and clean holding company requirements similar to those that currently apply only to gsibs this proposal would also impose a longterm debt requirement on certain categories of insured depository institutions that are not consolidated subsidiaries of us gsibs including insured depository institutions with billion or more in total assets such as the bank if adopted this proposal would require the corporation and the bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible longterm debt amount of no less than the greatest of i of riskweighted assets rwas ii of total leverage exposure and iii of average total consolidated assets the bank would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible longterm debt to the corporation and the corporation would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible longterm debt externally in addition if adopted as proposed the clean holding company requirement would limit or prohibit the corporation from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution including for example prohibiting the corporation from entering into transactions that could spread losses to subsidiaries and third parties as well as limiting the amount of the corporations liabilities that are not eligible longterm debt the public comment period on this proposed rule ran through january resolution planning as required by section 165d of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act the corporation is required to submit periodically to the federal reserve board and fdic a resolution plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure in august the federal reserve board and fdic proposed updated guidance on resolution planning requirements applicable to the corporation under section 165d the corporations next 165d plan submission is due to the fdic and federal reserve board by march in addition the bank as an insured depository institution is required to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of its failure with the next plan being due for submission on december in august the fdic issued a proposed rule that would require covered insured depository institutions such as the bank to submit a full resolution plan to the fdic every two years and submit an interim supplement in each year that it is not required to submit a full resolution plan the proposed rule would also increase the content requirements for plan submissions and introduce a new credibility standard for the fdics evaluation of resolution plans which would be enforceable against the covered insured depository institutions table start annual report northern trust corporation table end separately the european union bank recovery and resolution directive brrd sets out the framework for the recovery

doddfrank act certain financial companies such as the corporation and certain of its covered subsidiaries can be subjected to an orderly liquidation authority if in default or danger of default and their resolution under the us bankruptcy code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states among other requirements set by statute if the corporation were subject to orderly liquidation authority the fdic would be appointed as its receiver which would give the fdic considerable powers to resolve the corporation absent such actions the corporation as a bank holding company would remain subject to the us bankruptcy code the volcker rule the volcker rule generally prohibits banking entities including the bank and its affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading subject to certain exemptions and exclusions such as for marketmaking hedging certain trading activities in us and foreign sovereign debt and trading activities related to liquidity management the

the bank should the bank experience financial distress payment of dividends the corporation may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with the capital plan rules and capital adequacy standards of the federal reserve board including the stress capital buffer requirement discussed further in capital adequacy requirements below dividends from the bank are a significant source of funds for the corporation and the corporations ability to pay dividends on its common stock therefore depends in part on the ability of the bank to pay sufficient dividends to the corporation various other federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank to the corporation without regulatory consent the bank may not pay any dividends if it is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized in general the amount of dividends that may be paid in a calendar year is limited to its recent earnings the current years net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years or its undivided profits generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus whichever is less the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation may also be affected by the capital adequacy standards applicable to the bank discussed further below which include minimum requirements and buffers capital planning and stress testing the corporations capital distributions are subject to the federal reserve boards capital plan rules which require the corporation to submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board for review the major components of that oversight are the federal reserve boards comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar and doddfrank act stress tests dfast these requirements involve both companyrun and supervisoryrun table start annual report northern trust corporation table end testing of capital under various scenarios including baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the appropriate banking regulator under the dfast regulations the corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve board annually the bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the corporation results from the corporations and the banks annual companyrun stress tests are reported to the appropriate regulators and made publicly available northern trust published the results of its most recent companyrun stress tests on june capital adequacy requirements the corporation as a bank holding company is subject to riskbased and leverage capital guidelines implemented by the federal reserve board that are based on industrystandard guidelines published by the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee known as basel iii the bank as an fdicinsured depository institution is also required to meet riskbased and leverage capital guidelines established by regulators which are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies under the basel iii rules the corporation with the bank is a core banking organization that is required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly its riskbased capital ratios the corporation also is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach to calculating riskbased capital ratios the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the two in the assessment of its capital adequacy in july the us banking agencies issued a proposed rule to implement the basel iii endgame agreement for large banks basel iii endgame proposal the proposal would introduce a new measure of rwas known as expanded total rwas the expanded riskbased approach reflecting new rwa methodologies that generally align with changes to the global basel accord adopted by the basel committee the proposal would eliminate the current basel iii rules advanced approaches methodologies and effectively replace it with the expanded riskbased approach which more heavily relies on standardized methodologies as compared with the standardized approach the expanded riskbased approach includes more granular risk weights for credit risk and introduces a new market risk framework in addition unlike the standardized approach the expanded riskbased approach includes operational risk and credit valuation adjustment rwa components the basel iii endgame proposal if adopted as a final rule would maintain the current basel iii rules dualrequirement structure whereby the corporation and the bank would be required to calculate riskbased capital ratios under both the expanded riskbased approach and the standardized approach in addition the proposal would modify the standardized approach by requiring that the new market risk standards from the proposal also be applied in the standardized approach the basel iii endgame proposal would apply the stress capital buffer to riskbased capital requirements calculated under both the expanded riskbased approach and the standardized approach the proposal includes a proposed effective date of july with threeyear transition arrangements until revised standards are fully phased in on july based on our current understanding of the proposed rule we estimate that if the expanded riskbased approach had applied on a fully phasedin basis as of december and in the absence of taking any actions to mitigate its impact our expanded riskbased approach rwas as of that date would have been approximately to higher than our actual standardized approach rwas as of that date the proposed rule would phase in the higher expanded riskbased approach rwas on july of each year during the transition thereby increasing our regulatory capital requirements with delayed incorporation of the potentially lower stress capital buffer calculations table start annual report northern trust corporation table end the banks riskbased and leverage capital ratios at december were well above the

mostly for retail designated banks including the assessment areas in which a bank is evaluated to include activities associated with online and mobile banking the tests used to evaluate a bank in its assessment areas new methods of calculating credit for lending investment and service activities and additional data collection and reporting requirements the rule is expected to result in a significant increase in the thresholds for large banks to receive outstanding ratings in the future according to the new rule banks currently designated as wholesale will be absorbed into the limited purpose designation the rule outlines that a limited purpose bank is one that is not in the business of extending consumer or retail loans except on an incidental and accommodation basis limited purpose banks are only subject to a qualitative and quantitative review of a banks community development lending and investments in each assessment area while we will continue to be evaluated on our community development activities in our local markets we will also be evaluated against a national benchmark based on assets the rule is expected to take effect on april with most of its provisions becoming applicable on january reporting of the collected data will not be required until data privacy and security federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring financial institutions to adopt disclose and enforce privacy policies with respect to consumer information setting limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information setting standards for protecting client information and preventing unlawful access to such information and requiring notice of data breaches in certain circumstances for example the federal trade commission has the authority to regulate and enforce against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce including acts and practices with respect to data privacy and security and the grammleachbliley act regulates the confidentiality and security of customer information obtained by financial institutions and certain other types of financial services businesses most us states the eu and other nonus jurisdictions also have adopted their own statutes andor regulations concerning data privacy and security and requiring notification of data breachesfor example the general data protection regulation gdpr in europe and its equivalent in the uk uk gdpr the personal information protection law pipl in china and the california consumer privacy act as amended by the california privacy rights act collectively ccpa in the united states similar laws are in effect or being considered in other jurisdictions in which we operate across the globe the gdpr is designed to harmonize data privacy and security laws across the european economic area eea to protect eea citizens data privacy and security the gdpr imposes stringent operational requirements on both data controllers and data processors and has extraterritorial effect as its scope includes all data controllers and processors outside the eea whose processing activities relate to the offering of goods or services to or monitoring the behavior of eea individuals organizations that violate certain provisions of the gdpr could be fined up to million or of their annual worldwide revenue for the preceding fiscal year whichever is greater the gdpr also has been implemented into uk law as part of the arrangements following the uks withdrawal from the eu and operates in conjunction with other local data privacy requirements although the gdpr and uk gdpr may diverge over time the uk is also in the process of reforming its data privacy rules through a new data protection and digital information bill in the united states the ccpa broadly defines personal information and substantially increases the rights of california residents to understand how their personal information is collected used and otherwise processed by commercial businesses such as affording them the right to access and request deletion of their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information the ccpa includes a private right of action permitting lawsuits to be brought by private individuals instead of the state attorney general or other government actor for certain breaches and contemplates civil penalties of up to for each violation and up to for each intentional violation in addition several states have enacted comprehensive data privacy laws similar to the ccpa these will apply in addition to laws that already exist in all us states that require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach moreover the us congress has recently considered and is currently considering various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and security legislation to which we may be subject if enacted the corporation maintains a regulatory change framework to monitor and respond to regulatory change including for data privacy and has adopted and disseminated privacy policies and communicates required information relating to financial privacy and data security in accordance with applicable law consumer laws and regulations the corporations banking subsidiaries are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties table start annual report northern trust corporation table end operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution consumer laws and regulations are enforced by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb and other federal and state regulators nonus regulation northern trust is subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which its nonus branches and subsidiaries operate for example branches and subsidiaries conducting banking and asset servicing businesses in the uk are authorized to do so pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act they are authorized by the prudential regulation authority pra andor the financial conduct authority fca the pra and fca exercise broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to revoke temporarily or permanently authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations impose capital requirements suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees additionally the bank is licensed as a foreign authorized deposittaking institution in australia under the banking act australia and as a wholesale bank in singapore under the banking act singapore and as a result is subject to the supervision of the australian prudential regulation authority and the monetary authority of singapore respectively northern trusts european branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the eu and the member states in which they are domiciled for example northern trust global services se as an eudomiciled credit institution in luxembourg is subject to the prudential supervision of the ecb and the cssf moreover northern trusts noneu branches and subsidiaries conducting financial services activities in the eu may fall within the scope of the laws of the eu and given the increasing extraterritorial effect of eu legislation noneu branches and subsidiaries may still fall within the scope of eu law if they transact outside of the eu with eu clients since january the uk has not been a member of the eu eu legislation as it applied to the uk on december is a part of uk domestic legislation under the control of the uks parliament most uk law relevant to the corporation and its subsidiaries is still closely aligned with the eu legislative framework in place in december however in the uk government proposed legislation that makes significant reforms to the uks financial services regulations in particular the financial
