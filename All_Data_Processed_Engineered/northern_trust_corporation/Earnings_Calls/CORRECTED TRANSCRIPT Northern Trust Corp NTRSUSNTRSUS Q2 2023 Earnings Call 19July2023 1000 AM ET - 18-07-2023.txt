now turn the call over to jason jason j tyler chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp thank you mike and let me join jennifer and mike in welcoming you to our second quarter earnings call lets dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page this morning we reported second quarter net income of million earnings per share of and our return on average common equity was currency movements had an immaterial impact on our revenue and expense growth in both periods northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 our second quarter results were impacted by two notable items we recognized a million pretax severance charge impacting both our compensation and outside services line items we recorded a million pretax charge associated with the writeoff of an investment in a client capability notable items from previous periods are listed on the slide excluding notable items in all periods revenue is up on a sequential quarter basis and down over the prior year expenses were down on a sequential quarter basis and up over the prior year this reflects an expense to trust fee ratio of down from in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year pretax income was up sequentially but down over the prior year trust investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled billion which reflected a sequential increase but a decrease as compared to last year all other noninterest income was flat sequentially but down over the prior year net interest income on an fte basis which ill discuss in more detail in a few moments is million down sequentially but up from a year ago we had a million credit reserve release in the second quarter due to improved credit quality on a small number of larger loans which is offset in part by expectations for higher future economic stress in the commercial real estate market turning to our asset servicing results on page assets under custodyadministration for asset servicing clients were trillion at quarterend up sequentially and up yearoveryear asset servicing fees totaled million which were up sequentially but down yearoveryear custody and fund administration fees the largest component of fees in the business were million up sequentially but down yearover year custody and fund administration fees increased on a linkedquarter basis for the second consecutive quarter due to solid new business activity higher transaction activity and favorable markets they decreased from the prior year quarter primarily due to unfavorable markets assets under management for asset servicing clients were billion up sequentially and up year overyear investment management fees within asset servicing was million up sequentially but down yearoveryear investment management fees increased sequentially primarily due to asset inflows and favorable markets they decreased from the prior year quarter primarily due to asset outflows and unfavorable markets moving to our wealth management business on page assets under management for our wealth management clients were billion at quarter end up sequentially and up yearoveryear trust investment and other servicing fees were million up sequentially but down compared to the prior year sequentially the increase in fees in the regions was driven primarily by favorable markets sequentially the increase in gfo fees was driven by net inflows relative to the prior year the decrease in fees in the regions was primarily due to unfavorable markets and productrelated asset outflows within gfo the decrease in fees was due largely to unfavorable markets moving to page and our balance sheet and nii trends our average balance sheet decreased on a linked quarter basis primarily due to lower client deposits partially offset by higher leveraging activity earning assets northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 averaged billion in the quarter down sequentially and down versus the prior year money market assets primarily absorbed the decrease client liquidity continued to grow during the second quarter while we saw a decline in average deposits it was more than offset by increases in other categories relative to the first quarter our money market funds were up billion or and our cds were up average deposits were billion down billion or sequentially but remained consistent with lateapril levels we experienced a billion sequential decline in noninterestbearing deposits mostly within the institutional channel as clients continue to shift to higher yielding alternatives this reduced the mix of noninterest bearing deposits to at quarter end operational deposits comprised approximately twothirds of institutional deposits these tend to be the stickiest deposits as clients use them to operate their businesses approximately three quarters of our average deposits are institutional with the remainder related to wealth clients including gfo chipping to the asset side of the balance sheet average securities were down sequentially reflecting the natural runoff which weve seen to reinvest at the short end of the curve our billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid us treasury agency and sovereign wealth fund bonds and is split approximately evenly between available for sale and held to maturity the duration of securities portfolio continued to edge down in the second quarter to years the total balance sheet duration is now less than a year loan balances averaged billion and were up sequentially our loan portfolio is welldiversified across geographies operating segments and loan types approximately of the portfolio is floating and the overall duration is less than one year our liquidity remains strong with cash held at the fed and other central banks up to billion more than of our overall balance sheet is comprised of cash money market assets and available for sale securities this translates to billion of immediately available liquidity or more than of the total deposit base net interest income on an fte basis was million for the quarter down sequentially but up from the prior year nii reflected the impact of several dynamics we saw continued client migration out of deposits and into higher yielding alternatives noninterestbearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits slid to and deposit costs increase with our interest bearing deposit beta during the quarter reaching and our cumulative beta for the cycle at the net interest margin on an fte basis was for the quarter down basis points sequentially but up basis points from a year ago the sequential decline reflects the impact of higher funding costs partially offset by higher shortterm market rates our nii in the third quarter will continue to be driven by client behavior which has been less predictable given the speed and velocity of this cycles rate hikes our average client deposits thus far in the quarter are approximately billion deposit outflows are expected to continue in part due to seasonality as august is typically our low point in the year as european activity slows materially the pace of the outflows is expected to moderate turning to page as reported noninterest expenses were billion in the second quarter higher sequentially and higher than the prior year excluding charges in both periods as noted on the slide expenses in the second quarter were down sequentially but up yearoveryear ill hit on just a few highlights compensation and technology expense continue to be the areas of highest spend compensation expense excluding severance charges was down sequentially but up compared to the prior year it was down sequentially due to the payment of our annual retirement eligible incentives in the first quarter this is partially offset by the impact of this years base pay adjustments which are granted in the second quarter northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 the yearoveryear growth in compensation expense largely reflects the impact from inflationary wage pressures and last years employee expansion partially offset by lower incentives excluding charges noncompensation expense was up sequentially primary driver of the increase was growth in the outside services line which is up sequentially the increase is largely due to timing as we reported a sequential decline in outside services of in the first quarter due to delays in technical services projects with our heightened focus on expense control we expect our operating expenses to grow more modestly and our expense to trust fee ratio to show further improvement turning to page our capital ratios remain strong in the quarter and continue to be well above our required regulatory minimums our common equity tier ratio under standardized approach was flat to the prior quarter at despite continued common stock repurchases this reflects a basis point buffer above regulatory requirements our tier leverage ratio is up slightly from the prior quarter we returned million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of million and common stock repurchases of million and with that jenny please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and i do have a question from steven chubak wolfe research please go ahead sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning this is actually sharon leung filling in for steven just a question on deposit betas they came in a little bit better than expected this quarter can you help us understand how to think about the incremental betas from here jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so betas have continued to increase and from here i think we still have to separate the institutional client base from the wealth client base we noted that we were cumulatively across the platform within this quarter in the high80 range the institutional channel is likely going to be at at this point the wealth channel still provides some benefit the betas there are a lot lower but at this point were seeing about in the institutional channel and still much less than that in wealth and that seems to those both of those trends seem to be continuing as weve seen early signs in the quarter sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc great and then as a followup you noted youre at about noninterest bearing deposits today i think you had troughed closer to about in the ph to cycle can you help us think through where that potentially goes from here and once that starts to normalize where you see nii exiting the year jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 sharon well like you weve looked back a lot at where its troughed and the data we have showed at a little higher than the you mentioned i think its but i dont think about that as a floor theres nothing structural in the base to consider that a floor now that said it has been moderating significantly and we dont see we havent seen much movement at this point obviously theres a step down this quarter of another percentage point but it seems to be leveling off at this point sharon leung q analyst wolfe research llc great thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp thank you operator next question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc good morning hello everybody so a couple of questions around expense trends i guess one a little bit more near term you guys announced some action obviously over the course of the quarter theres a severance charge so maybe help us quantify what it means in terms of savings and your just updated views on the overall sort of firmwide expense growth for the year i guess excluding the charges occurred in the second quarter i think last time you talked about bringing that down to below but maybe an update there would be helpful and then bigger picture question you guys are running at a kind of high 20ishpercent pretax margin that used to be north of so as you kind of think about the fee environment getting a little better with the market but nii has clearly peaked as we talked about before is there an opportunity to get back to that 30plus and how do you see sort of achieving that if thats the goal and whats the timeframe around that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so let me tackle the expense the compensation related first first im sure people are curious where is the base from here so let me just provide some background on kind of first quarter to second quarter second quarter to third quarter i think from here wed say flat to down from second quarter ex the severance charge in the compensation line so if i go back to last quarter we explained that the significant movements for second quarter would be the million seasonal decline in equity awards and then the million increase in the base pay coming online that would have put comp at about million for the quarter and obviously ex the charge we ended up about million better than that including currency so two factors led to that northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 first we pulled a lot of levers in the quarter to flatten compensation including accelerating and close to completing the actions that we launched in fourth quarter of last year so in january we communicated that the projected reduction by late would be about roles and about million to million in quarterly comp benefit net of reinvestments so we guide a portion of that work done in the first quarter and we mostly finished it in second quarter and that was big part of the reason it put us ahead of schedule second as we saw the timing of that first program accelerating and coming to completion we launched a new effort during the second quarter specifically related to what you referenced alex in the severance charge that we announced this morning weve already gotten some benefit of that within the quarter and thats reflected in the result so overall this new program to your question should impact about an incremental roles many of that will be backfilled based on a lens of skills or geography but same goal we should be able to get million to million a quarter in run rate savings and a portion of that got embedded in the second quarter so weve got to remember that we did pull the lever hard this quarter so theres some hiring thats in the queue but we also pushed a fair amount back and so thats why with various puts and starts its good to think about a flat to down from the comp levels you see in second quarter ex charges going into third quarter so thats a hopefully helpful background there to get to your questions on for the rest of the year where do we see expenses at a high level weve taken about point out of the curve for the year based on the trajectory that were on to your point if you take out the notable items this year on each quarter has been under points and we think weve taken that point out of the curve at this point and that should continue through the rest of the year to margins youre right that we and wed been in the and now in the our target has us one of our key performance indicators is for us to be in the and no way have we lost sight on that that is where were trying to get that gets impacted largely by whats going to happen in our minds we can control the expense side and obviously were doing a lot of work there and were also getting good benefit because we saw good organic growth in the quarter and so both levers are working in the right way but we have definitely not changed our target of being in the from a margin perspective alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks super comprehensive just a quick followup around deposit so good news you guys were kind of in line with what you updated us on around million it sounds like deposits are fairly stable i think you said million right now with a kind of similar noninterestbearing mix as we saw over the course of the quarter can you help just frame the seasonal deposit outflows in any other kind of client conversations youre hearing that could give us a sense where deposits could ultimately trough in the cycle sounds like theres a little bit more to go but just curious to hear what the endpoint might be jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah you heard right its held in quite well so far in july and we didnt june you see the end of the quarter and theres a spike there but in general june and july have been at about this level and have been holding in well our client activity is good weve taken action here to make sure were talking to clients aggressively and telling them we want to continue providing good liquidity services for them whether its lending or holding on to northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 their deposits but weve got a we talked last quarter about the fact that we think about liquidity broadly its about client liquidity and it was good to see money market funds up this quarter that adds to margins really well too and even as we think about what clients are holding in brokerage and so all of the client liquidity seems to be holding in well on the seasonality dynamic august is a low point but its not it doesnt go down dramatically weve looked back several years and so were feeling that deposits at these levels seem to be holding in okay so i can even give a little bit of thought from our perspective at this point based on our outlook i think its prudent to think about another decline even though the deposits are holding in pretty well but we see the competition and so i think its prudent to think about another nii decline of about for the quarter again june and july volumes have held in at about billion to billion but we just have to be conscious of the competitive environment and what the summer tends to hold in terms of volume pressure alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc understood great thanks so much jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you bet thanks alex operator and our next question is going to come from brian bedell from deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning good morning hope all is well maybe just to go back to expenses appreciate the color you gave jason normally you start to talk about the seasonal lift that you typically get in the second half in things like equipments and software and outside services so i wonder if you want to comment on any projection there jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure well its good to call it out i think in equipment and software in particular we were better than what we thought we were going to be but that was really two factors led to that one we did have some delays in projects coming from wip into being depreciated those will come online so thats more timing and then secondly weve been working very aggressively as far as the productivity office to just negotiate on and then try and push inflation down and we had some good results there bringing costs down northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 and so from here we think third quarter up million to million in that line item fourth quarter we can even tell because some of its baked an additional million to million lift from that perspective and outside services no update to make there brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then mike you started off the call talking about some of the new business wins in asset servicing and wealth management i guess how should we think about that contributing to organic revenue growth maybe just broadly if were in a say a flat flattish market situation would you expect this to have a positive impact in the next couple of quarters and going on revenue michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah brian so the answer is yes and to your point we only consider it organic growth once its transitioned and in and yet we know the pipeline of business or mandates that weve won that have not transitioned in yet and in each of the businesses its a little bit different theres more of a ill call it forward pipeline with asset servicing but the pipeline looks very good based on recent activity that i mentioned there within wealth management theres not as much of a forward pipeline if you will but similarly there i would say very steady steady activity and as much as anything with wealth management keeping in mind that this ill say company but also that business has been built on doing whats right for the client and sometimes that results in different financial implications for the company but over time it is best for the company and the shareholders and my point being the discussion around deposits and money market funds and treasuries and managing things like that they all have different implications for us but the client activity has been very good and were i would say optimistic about how some of the shifts with rates will have implications on where those funds get redeployed so again positive on the wealth management front in a steady fashion and then asset management as jason mentioned weve seen strong flows into the money market platform there but that also in some other areas as well and likewise i like to see those get redeployed in other ways over time so good across the board brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so its fair to say that revenue growth on the fee side is definitely better than the nii side for the organic growth equation at least now michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah no thats right brian and i view it as youre kind of implying there on the fee side it tends to kind of grind up more gradually subject to the markets and nni can be more volatile and the only other area i would just highlight is around our capital markets activity fx and brokerage and trading there which has been relatively subdued during this time period with lower volatilities lower activity which that can also change and that has different implications too just meaning those can be more profitable brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 right thats great great thanks thanks for all the color michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator and robert rutschow from wells fargo please go ahead robert rutschow q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question i guess the first question is on fee growth kind of more broadly youve sort of indicated that youre at the expense growth rate does that go down but do the fees where do you see fees growing to get up to that expense level so that you can grow fees faster than expenses jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp well i mean in the short run i think were still i dont think were still absorbing an inflationary environment from an expense perspective and so wed like to be able to do better even than what were doing right now in the long run from an expense growth perspective on the revenue side as you know the lift the financial model enables us to have lift from two different areas one is the market lift and thats tended to provide lowsingledigit growth rates but its a very strong component of the financial model and then secondly the organic growth and if we can have lowsingledigit growth in wealth management organically then midsingledigit growth in asset servicing that provides a good model for us to get well above the expense rates that we think we can lead to in the long run and provide good operating leverage robert rutschow q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and if i could followup on wealth youve improved growth there as well are there any differences in the competitive dynamic among the top end in the low end are you having more success you said youre having more success in the global family office i guess can you talk about the funnel of new clients sort of in the middle tier and what youre doing to grow that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah its interesting its actually not just the family office but the very top end of wealth advisory and those clients can be similar size they just happen to not have a family office and are leaning more toward us for wealth advice as opposed to the broader set of more operational and reporting services that the global family office provides we are doing better at the top end and looking at the new business that came on board and at the pipeline the accounts above million just that was where there was more velocity and thats been consistent for a while on that business and so there is something to that dynamic we seem to be doing better at the top end thats where a disproportionate percentage of the growth has come from northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 robert rutschow q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you bet operator and our next question is going to come from brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning hey how you doing just a quick clarification point jason you referenced a point of expense benefit is it right to interpret that as coming off of your prior or better expectation or was that meant in a different way jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp it is correct to interpret that as saying we dont see at this point we said or better and at this point we should be doing or better weve done that first half and we see path to that the second half as well brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc perfect thank you for clarifying that and then jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp thank you brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sure you guys had a writeoff of a client capability i dont remember seeing that in the past just a little confusing to me so maybe if you could help me understand it when did you build that capability and what happened that caused you to write it off jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah i can give you some thoughts on it its just from a timing perspective its been in the works for many many quarters but one of the pillars of the productivity office is to look at what we refer to as internal investments to ensure that theyre on track to meet our hurdle rates for returns and margins the charge was a project to build out a new client capability in asset servicing and specifically in the asset owners channel northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 so after working and eventually discussing with different stakeholders we didnt reach commercial agreement on terms that would meet our hurdles and so we halted the project i think importantly i presume youd ask are there others like this in inventory absolutely not we dont this was a large project endeavor that weve been working on and didnt reach resolution that got to our hurdle rates and so stopped the project brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay did something happen in the sort of like revenue opportunity that diminished it versus where you planned because im sure you guys went through the process before you broke ground so to speak at least metaphorically or was it that it was really pricey it turned out to be more expensive to build was it the expense side that that hurt the outlook versus plan or was it the revenue opportunity jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah it was more costly to build than we thought and the revenue dynamics were not at that point going to get to our hurdle rate and it really is reflective of us taking an extremely disciplined approach on items like this where were not going to devote resources to areas where were not going to achieve our hurdle rate and so well before we talked about this even internally one of the pillars that we talked about for the productivity office was looking at our internal investments and this fits squarely in one of those areas we define that as areas where were allocating resources whether its capital or expense dollars and were not at our hurdle rate and so this is one where we were disciplined in saying were going to stop now halt it and not invest more into this brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thanks for explaining that jason its actually a lot more encouraging than i interpreted it on paper so thanks for the color jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp no yeah no thanks for asking it probably if its helpful to you to clarify its helpful to others so thank you operator and next question comes from rob wildhack autonomous research go ahead please jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning guys good morning just a bigger picture question on expenses where do you want or whats your target i guess for that expense to trust ratio over the long run and then what are the sort of necessary ingredients to get there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah if we can be in the to range then thats to then we feel like were in good shape to do well and were grinding to get down there we got down there before weve been well above it we got down into that range in fact even slightly below it for a quarter or two and now all the factors weve talked about higher inflation markets coming down and the fact of nii going up not helping that metric were outside that range but it is an important part of our financial model to be in that range and so its the first thing its first thing i look at is where are we and its good to see us getting back toward the number that we the range that weve articulated its another one of the key performance indicators that we talk about internally robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp got it thanks and just one followup on the positive organic growth commentary this morning if you saw a big acceleration in organic growth or a sustained period of strong organic growth multiple quarters even several years how do you think that would impact expense growth if at all michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so rob your two questions relate to each other which is the primary way that we can drive that ratio to the range that jason talked about is through organic growth on the fee side and then controlling organic expenses all right and to your point if you have higher organic growth that is going to require more resources and to the extent that you dont achieve that then you have to make sure that youre reducing the organic growth on the expense side to get there but those are the two areas that we control the most and then you say okay but beyond that as jason mentioned on the fee side its going to have the impact of markets and sometimes currency and on the expense side youre going to have the impact from inflation and to some extent currency and so you try to focus on what you can control the most which are those two items organic growth on fees and organic growth on expenses to ultimately drive it to the target range robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thank you both jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator and betsy graseck from morgan stanley is next please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning betsy northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 connell j schmitz q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning this is actually connell schmitz filling in for betsy jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp how are you connell j schmitz q analyst morgan stanley co llc good how are you so just one question a little bit nuanced on the credit portfolio seems like a little bit of an outlier i know its small but on the reserve release it seems like an outlier that theres an improved outlook on your cre book can you just explain whats going on there and where you see this line item from here jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah so actually just to clarify there was the release the release is a result of some improvement in a small number of borrowers in that book but that more than offset an actually worsening outlook that we have overall for cre and so its not dramatic but our outlook on that portion of the book actually would have caused an increase in the reserve connell j schmitz q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay that makes more sense jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure connell j schmitz q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess one other question on the investment portfolio you mentioned duration still subone year and youre mostly in cash at what point just given the context of potential future rate hikes where do you see like this duration heading in the coming months and how are you planning to mix shift this book in that context to ph detect nii yeah jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah absolutely so the duration of the securities book is at ph the duration of the balance sheet is just under one year and youre absolutely right to call out that it is an interesting time and what we think of as the evolution of the yield curve and so weve been allowing the maturity of securities to go to become more liquid as we reinvest them thats brought down duration at this point with the yield curve we are talking about where to go from here and thats not indicating its going to go up but its not on a at this point we are thinking about where is the yield curve where is it going and how northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 does that influence what we want to do as the large securities book continues to mature and provide opportunity for reinvestment connell j schmitz q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then i guess one followup on that same topic how should we think about earning asset growth in the context of deposit outflows potentially should those flow out on a onetoone basis or will you maintain certain balance sheet size or jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah as the deposits come down the securities can act as obviously a funding mechanism for it that doesnt move very quickly and so the deposit size is always going to influence the earning asset size and so what we have to then think about the constraining factor at that point becomes what does leverage look like and weve got a lot of room from a leverage perspective and so thats what sometimes will lead us to think about discretionary leveraging just to make sure that were not missing opportunities to pick up some nii even if its at very thin nim based on where the size of the balance sheet is because it doesnt flex super quickly connell j schmitz q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thats helpful all right that was it from me thanks a lot jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure thank you sure operator and our next question is going to come from mike brown from kbw please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning mike michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning maybe just actually following up on that question there we noticed that the complexion of your balance sheet has been shifting on the funding side naturally and that makes sense but your deposits they declined by but we saw that the higher cost fed fund purchased balance actually jumped meaningfully quarteroverquarter has been growing this year i guess why not just let the balance sheet decline more like whats kind of going on there in terms of the mix and how could that progress from here if the deposits continue to trend down as you talked about will that balance the fed funds purchase balance continue to grow as an offset to fund the assets jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 yeah and part of it is that in this the deposits have just been so volatile and so you dont want to comment to significant movement and shrinking the balance sheet and we want to be there for our clients weve got plenty of capital weve got plenty of room for a leverage perspective and so just not anxious to quickly do any significant moves and so to that extent as deposits come down you have the opportunity to then say well maybe we want to use some discretionary leveraging again indiscernible tier leverage which leaves you a lot of room and so if we hadnt done leveraging that incremental leveraging would be even higher in the and at a point you just have to say it is prudent to make sure youre taking advantage of the opportunities that exist so michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks for the color there and then i guess maybe just following up on that point there on the capital side you guys increased the share buyback or you bought back about million or so of stock this quarter any expectation on how that could progress from here what should we think about in terms of your capital return jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure the overall theme of what you saw in this quarter makes sense in the nearterm or you see a speed in the market for share repurchase the thing that worked against us the aoci actually worked slightly against us this quarter usually in a neutral rate environment the pull the par will give us some lift there but it did in this quarter thats fine but even so million we did is about what its kind of thats the model were thinking about in the short run big caveat is that the fdic special assessment coming online presumably in third quarter that would be a similar dollar amount as what we did from a repurchase perspective this quarter and so you could see us saying hold off for a quarter get that payment done and then get back to your game plan michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you for the color jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator next question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi jason how are you northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp very well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jason can you share with us i think you gave us the cumulative beta through the cycle of and then the incremental beta of course is higher i think you touched on it this quarter maybe the question is this how is the beta behaving relative to past tightening cycles i dont know if to is a cycle that really is that comparable maybe i have to go back a little further and then second how quickly if the fed does start cutting fed fund rates in sometime how quickly can you guys reduce your deposit costs jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure on the first just to make sure i said it right earlier the going forward would be for the institutional side of the business not for the overall deposit base gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah yeah and to the question of how does how does that compare historically this is higher than it has been historically and just theres different dynamics that you and i could talk about i think that are driving that but theres a very strong competition for deposits right now and for various reasons and so we want to make sure that were there for our clients and we still weve got the ability to do that and so we want to make sure that were holding on to our fair share and providing that liquidity capability for clients if you think about reductions the reductions can they can come quickly and the way we priced the way our agreements work we get fast movement on the way down and so we should be able to get deposit costs down quickly as rates come down gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a follow up you also touched on the volatility of deposits is it more based on your guys experience at northern are you finding that this periods volatility is even greater than past periods and is it because of quantitative tightening or fed actions that is causing greater volatility in your guys estimate jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp it is more volatile not just over the long run and we went from ph to down to but even within the quarters a lot of volatility but i think thats driven by some of the macro factors and what we saw in early march spooked a lot of depositors obviously and then another trend of debt ceiling and then leading to another trend of deposit competition northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 all of those things are having or driving significant different preferences that clients have not just between which bank to go to but whether to use banks versus money market funds versus treasuries i think all of those factors are reports leading to the heightened volatility were seeing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it okay thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator and next question comes from vivek juneja from jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks good morning a couple of questions our sovereign noninterestbearing deposits the big outflow you saw in the second quarter which segment did that come more out of and what are you seeing in that trend sorry if im repeating a question thereve been overlapping calls this minute i hope im not doing that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp the significant movements are almost always going to come well not almost all within this case came from asset servicing and vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and the stabilization where are you seeing more of that or which segment jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp the asset servicing segment has actually overall been relatively stable well see big chunky movements in and out but the overall level has been about the same the wealth segment is more granular the gfo client base is much chunkier but you just think about the amount of clients in the wealth segment it just makes it more granular northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and on the wealth management segment the lowsingledigit expense growth is that because thats where youve done a lot of the head count cutting that you all talked about and what are the implications for service there jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp service has been great and we didnt provide detail in the expense allocation between the business units but just in general youll note that the head count is down but no impact to service levels whatsoever this lowsingle digit growth i referenced was related to organic growth within wealth management vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay all right thanks operator the next question comes from robert rutschow from wells fargo robert rutschow q analyst wells fargo securities
