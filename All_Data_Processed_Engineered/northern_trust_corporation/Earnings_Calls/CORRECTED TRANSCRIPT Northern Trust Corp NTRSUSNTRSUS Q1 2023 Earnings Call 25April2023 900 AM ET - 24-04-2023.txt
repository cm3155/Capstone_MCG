you jennifer let me join in welcoming you to our first quarter earnings call the recent disruption in the banking sector reminds us of the importance of resiliency to be able to meet the needs of clients in all operating environments during the past six weeks much like over the past years our strong balance sheet and conservative approach to risk management have enabled us to provide the support liquidity and exceptional service our clients have come to expect from us northern trust continues to be viewed as a source of strength and stability as symbolized by our anchor during the quarter we continue to assist our clients manage their liquidity including deposits money market funds and shortterm treasuries through the transition from a period of quantitative easing and low interest rates to one of rapid tightening and higher rates overall we saw client liquidity increase during the quarter as the decline in deposits was more than offset by increases in higher yielding money market funds our results for the first quarter reflects sequential improvement in revenue and expense growth the sequential growth in trustees outpaced a slight decrease in net interest income which still experienced healthy yearoveryear growth expense growth moderated from recent quarters which was attributable to both our renewed spending discipline and certain timing differences northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 within our wealth management business assets under management grew midsingle digits sequentially while our trust fees increased modestly the turmoil in the banking space contributed to a flurry of new business activity later in the quarter we saw solid new account openings particularly at the upper end of the wealth market we took in almost billion in inflows from the million in over segment alone and discussions are continuing with the solid pipeline of prospective clients in asset management we had a strong start to the year with the sequential increase in new business including large inflows into our institutional money market platform new product launches focused on alternatives and extending securities lending capabilities in our collective fund space with three new funds launched within asset servicing we saw continued momentum with particularly good traction in europe for example during the quarter we transitioned in artemis investment management a large ukbased investment manager for whom we are providing a full suite of services including custody fund administration investment operations outsourcing and risk and analytics services for both their uk and luxembourg funds in closing we are wellpositioned to continue to serve our clients and navigate the ongoing economic uncertainty from a position of strength ill now turn the call over to jason jason j tyler chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp thank you mike and let me join jennifer and mike in welcoming you to our first quarter earnings call lets dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page this morning we reported first quarter net income of million earnings per share of and our return on average common equity was on a year overyear basis currency movements unfavorably impacted our revenue growth by approximately basis points and favorably impacted our expense growth by approximately basis points on a sequential basis currency movements favorably impacted our revenue growth by approximately basis points and unfavorably impacted our expense growth by approximately basis points our first quarter results were also impacted by two notable items one we recognized a million pretax gain on the securities repositioning we announced last quarter and executed in january we recorded nine two we reported million of pretax charges associated with various early lease termination actions taken to further optimize our global real estate footprint notable items from previous periods are listed on the slide excluding the notable items in all periods revenue was flat on a sequential quarter basis and up over the prior year expenses were flat on a sequential quarter basis and up over the prior year reflecting an expense to trust fee ratio of pretax income was down sequentially and down over the prior year trust investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled billion and were down from last year but up sequentially excluding notable items we had yearoveryear and sequential declines in all other noninterest income which is primarily driven by lower foreign exchange trading income we saw significantly reduced volumes in the first two months of the quarter with a modest pickup in march net interest income on an fte basis which ill also discuss in more detail in a few moments was million up from a year ago down sequentially our provision for credit losses was million for the first quarter reflecting growth in the size and duration of the commercial real estate loan portfolio given the increased northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 attention being placed on commercial real estate loans we want to provide some detail we thought would be of interest commercial real estate loans comprise of our total portfolio and commercial office loans comprise of total loans approximately of commercial real estate loans are personally guaranteed and approximately have a loantovalue ratio of less than or equal to turning to our asset servicing results on page assets under custodyadministration for asset servicing clients were trillion at quarter end down yearoveryear but up sequentially asset servicing fees totaled million which were also down yearoveryear but up sequentially custody and fund administration fees the largest component of fees in the business were million down yearoveryear but up sequentially custody and fund administration fees decreased from prior year quarter primarily due to unfavorable markets and unfavorable currency translation they increased sequentially due to favorable markets favorable currency translation and solid new business activity particularly later in the quarter transactional activity which comprises approximately of our custody and fund administration fees was generally weaker due to lower volumes and lower onetime fees assets under management for asset servicing clients were billion down yearoveryear but up sequentially investment management fees within asset servicing were million down yearoveryear but up sequentially investment management fees decreased from the prior year quarter primarily due to asset outflows and unfavorable markets partially offset by lower money market fund fee waivers investment management fees increased sequentially due to favorable markets and favorable currency translation moving to our wealth management business on page assets under management for our wealth management clients were billion at quarterend down yearoveryear but up on a sequential basis trust investment and other servicing fees were million down compared to the prior year but up sequentially within both the regions and gfo the yearoveryear declines were primarily driven by unfavorable market impacts and product level asset outflows partially offset by the elimination of money market fund fee waivers sequentially the increase within the regions in gfo was primarily driven by favorable markets partially offset by product level asset outflows the upturn we saw in our aum occurred later in the quarter was not fully reflected in our trust fees importantly we continue to see modest organic growth in our core advisory fees moving to page on our balance sheet and nii trends given the attention being placed on balance sheet trends we also thought you might be interested in some additional data points this quarter we think about client liquidity in three categories deposits money market funds and shortterm treasuries with that background we can provide some color and data on what we saw throughout the quarter and through the first few weeks of april most importantly client liquidity was up meaningfully for the quarter in both asset servicing and wealth management and its continued to rise during the first three weeks of april while we saw a decline in deposits for the quarter it was more than offset by increases in money market funds as clients continue to migrate into higher yielding products relative to the fourth quarter our money market funds are up billion or as mentioned average deposits were billion down sequentially with wealth management deposits down and institutional down approximately three quarters of our average deposits are institutional within this segment approximately are considered operational the stickiest as clients use these funds to run their northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 ongoing operations across the organization we experienced a billion decline in noninterestbearing deposits as client shifted to higher yielding alternatives this reduced the mix of noninterestbearing deposits to we actively manage our assets and liabilities considering a wide range of possible stress scenarios including interest rate risks and how they may affect liquidity and capital so lets shift to the asset side of the balance sheet to see how investments are allocated average cash held at the fed and other central banks was up to billion and we had billion of immediately available liquidity reflecting approximately of average earning assets loan balances averaged billion and were down sequentially our loan portfolio is welldiversified across geographies operating segments and loan types approximately of the portfolio is floating and the overall duration is less than one year securities were down sequentially reflecting the impact of both our repositioning early in the quarter and the natural runoff which weve chosen to reinvest at the short end of the curve our billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid us treasury agency and sovereign wealth fund bonds and is split between available for sale and held to maturity in the aggregate the securities portfolio has a duration of years the total balance sheet duration is year net interest income was million for the quarter up from the prior year and down sequentially nii reflected the impact of several dynamics many occurring late in the quarter as mentioned we saw continued improvement in deposits from our balance sheet to money market funds and treasuries deposit costs increased with our interestbearing deposit beta during the quarter at and our cumulative beta for the cycle as of march of and finally we had the impact from two fewer days in the quarter net interest margin was in the quarter up basis points from a year ago and roughly flat with the prior quarter the sequential results reflect the impact of higher shortterm market rates offset by higher funding costs the prioryear increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates for the second quarter our nii will continue to be driven by client demand which is less predictable than it was days ago our average client deposits thus far in the quarter are approximately billion and subsequent to tax season weve observed an incremental typical decline of a few billion dollars turning to page as reported noninterest expenses were billion in the first quarter higher than the prior year but lower sequentially excluding charges in both periods as noted on the slide expenses in the first quarter were up yearoveryear but flat sequentially overall were focused on reducing the rate of expense growth and controlling those costs that are most under our control ill hit on just a few highlights compensation and technology expense continue to be the areas of highest spend compensation expense excluding charges was up compared to the prior year and up sequentially the yearoveryear growth largely reflects the annualization of last years head count expansion and inflationary wage pressure partially offset by lower incentives the sequential increase is due to our annual payment of retirement eligible equity incentives in the first quarter equipment and software largely reflecting our technology spend was up yearoveryear but up sequentially more than of our spend is comprised of business driven investment followed by spending on core infrastructure and modernization and to a lesser extent spending on information security risk and regulatory areas northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 turning to page our capital ratios improved in the quarter and continued to be well above our required regulatory minimum our common equity tier ratio under the standardized approach was up basis points from the prior quarter to despite resuming common stock repurchases this reflects a basis point buffer above our regulatory requirements as a reminder as a category ii institution under the federal reserves framework we already include unrealized losses on our available for sale securities in this calculation thus marktomarket losses occur immediately in our capital and capital ratios our tier leverage ratio was up basis points from the prior quarter higher net income improved accumulated other comprehensive income the securities repositioning and lower loan balances were the primary factors in this quarters increase in capital ratios we returned million to common shareholders in the quarter through cash dividends of million and after pausing meaningful share buybacks for the prior five quarters we repurchased over million of common stock and with that cynthia please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and we will take our first question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc really great quarter thanks for all the detail and the incremental information here i did just want to understand how youre thinking about managing the balance sheet in an environment where deposits are under pressure even though it might be modest i think you indicated that average deposits qtodate is around billion and thats down around from last quarter i believe so just wanted to understand how youre thinking about that thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure the most important thing and you referenced it is that its just its an uncertain environment and although weve got weve over billion and what we refer to is economic liquidity which is the cash we have on hand at the fed here and central banks around the world and also the short term securities we have so that provides a ton of liquidity but the environment is just uncertain and so on in some ways we want to just maintain as much liquidity as possible and not be greedy northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 and on the other side the balance sheet is always available for clients and we particularly from a liquidity perspective and that means we want to leave plenty of room for clients that either want to deposit with us or also might need lending from us and so these uncertain times just call for maximum patience for us and maximum flexibility so that we can be available for whatever our clients want betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and just as a follow up to that could you help us understand how youre thinking about the loan book going forward because to the extent there is demand it seems like youve got a decent amount of capacity there thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure yeah youre right theres a as you think about this effectively the securities book at billion act as the ultimate fulfillment of and completion mechanism in the balance sheet we couldnt do all of that with loans but we certainly have capacity to do a lot more but its always going to start from our perspective with maintaining prudent credit quality and approach and then working the best thing we can do is work with existing clients on existing types of loans and so thats why a couple of years ago you heard us talk about an initiative to do more lending we did that that was very largely with existing clients from here forward were not looking to have any initiatives to dramatically increase the loan book its from our perspective its responding to clients as they need in different categories and that the turmoil that were looking at it does provide opportunities if you look at the if you look internally at the opportunities that we have theres a lot of opportunity and so we have to be thoughtful about how to grow and with what clients or prospects we want to grow but this is a period where there are opportunities out there betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure thanks betsy operator we will take our next question from alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp good morning alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi guys good morning good morning and thank you for the question so i was hoping we could start with opportunities you guys are seeing in the wealth channel on the back of the dislocation in the banking space mike you mentioned obviously a flurry of activity towards the end of the quarter so maybe help us frame what that northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 means in terms of maybe revenues and i guess zooming out a little bit what has been happening and i guess continues to happen in the banking world does that increase your kind of organic growth prospects and to what extent in the wealth channel michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure alex so as i did mentioned there has been a lot of activity and as weve talked about before when theres more money in motion we do have the opportunity to grow a little bit faster and so we did see that pick up in the first quarter after the back half of last year we talked about the fact that there was less activity as a result of the interest rate environment that said this is something where the nature of the clients that we serve and that we work with and that we look to bring on board are pretty meaningful and so its a longer term process and i would say business building process than what i would call a sales process to do that i mentioned some of the momentum that we saw in the upper part of the market above million and the fact that we have a lot of prospects in that area as well so we see this more as i would say a longer running opportunity rather than a one quarter two quarter opportunity and thats how were approaching it alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it great and then my followup just around deposits and talk about this comment thanks again for the extra detail so billion average so far in april and it sounds like maybe down a little bit more on the back of the tax season where things are standing now whats the mix i guess between interest bearing and noninterest bearing balances in the way you guys see it right now in april and when it comes to the wealth deposits in particular sounds like they were down a little bit more the institutional in the quarter so i guess as you think about and rolling forward whats the approach to the rate you guys are paying on wealth deposits from here since it seems like a lot of it is ultimately still sorting into money market funds jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so let me give you a couple of incremental data points to work with one youre right we and its typical obviously as you know well alex for us to see a drop after the peak of tax season and so it has come down a few in the range of billion or billion since that average relative to that average and that said we from a mix perspective not seeing anything dramatically different early on and we talked about the fact that the non interestbearing mix is higher than even it was last time rates were up but as rates flatten out probably less incremental shift from that mix and then within wealth in particular the mike mentioned the growth there and youre exactly right in calling out a lot of it go to cash and i mentioned that theres a lift overall in client liquidity so of the lift that weve seen in cash and in cash about billion of that was in the wealth channel alone over the quarter and so and that more than offsets the deposit decline that we saw in that channel and so you just get a sense that the flows in that business are positive and give us a sense that theres good activity there alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you sorry and just whats the rate on the wealth deposit that you guys are paying right now jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 its highly dependent it varies by size by region by type and so its hard to give a its impossible to give a specific number on it but if you look at the what might be instructive as youre thinking about is more of an overall average cost across the book which is call it basis points to basis points basis points to basis points michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp and alex i would just add that theres no question with whatever with everything thats happened here that the market for deposits is more competitive so theres more price competition with lots of banks looking to retain or gain deposits and pricing aggressively to do that of course we have to likewise price to make them attractive for our clients but at a certain point if its just going to get priced away on price as opposed to relationships then youre going to see some go away and just more broadly on deposits its just i think important to understand the nature of our client base which you know well but just asset owners asset managers wealth clients that have different characteristics than a lot of other institutions certainly on the operational side these are deposits that they have as a part of running their operations and so very sticky in the sense that its based on transaction flows rather than necessarily rate per se and on the other hand these are institutions that are evaluated based on their performance and so when rates go up as fast as they have here they have to make sure theyre earning returns overall so theyre looking to be efficient and with our wealth clients as well were working with them to make sure that they get attractive returns overall so a lot of dynamics at play and i think its important to understand the characteristics of our client base relative to others alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah for sure and thank you guys for all the detail appreciate it jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure thanks alex operator we will take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning mike mayo a analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so jason northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc wanted to start off with a question on the noncomps looking at the component pieces you guys made some good progress there a good amount of the beat was really in outside services i know that that has a heavy variable or activity linked component should we expect that to normalize as activity levels pick up consistent with what you saw at the end of march just trying to think about whats a reasonable jumping off point for us to be modeling for next quarter jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah absolutely youre right and that that line item can move around a lot so let me give you a shortterm and then maybe a longer term dynamic in the short run that line item was impacted by call it two things one some timing so we know that there some of that improvement will likely come back online in second quarter and then secondly weve taken expense actions in that category and so weve worked really hard and to work down consulting to work down other tech services subcustody negotiating hard on thirdparty advisory fees and so some of it definitely is related to the expense measures that we talked about broadly related to the productivity office but theres also some timing there too and so as you think about the second quarter this is an area where youll see a meaningful increase call it million just quarteroverquarter going into next year about million of that is just a movement from onpremise processing that would show up in equipment and software moving up into outside services but theres also just business growth and timing related there as well were obviously not going to see million less consistently but thats one where were likely to see one go into second quarter steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and then just for my followup on nii i know you had alluded to this in some of your commentary and ill also echo i appreciate the additional detail on the deposit side theres been some debate previously as to whether nii or nim had peaked at this juncture whether it could eclipse levels seen last cycle i was hoping you could give some perspective just on the nii trajectory if its peaked at this juncture or if theres room for growth and given the balance sheet repositioning you alluded to in terms of shortening the duration on the asset side how we should think about the nii trajectory in a fed easing cycle in particular would be really helpful jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so on the first the reality is even this quarter you could see there was a new factor introduced into nii which is just client preference and you can see just how often even this morning on this call we dont talk about just deposits in isolation we talk about them in conjunction with money market funds and a part of that is that just culturally we have an incredibly strong focus just on providing advice to clients across whatever is appropriate for them and there are advantages to being in deposits there are advantages to being in money market funds there are advantages to being in short term treasuries and we think about that we tracked inside the company thats what we were looking at very very closely on a very periodic on a very frequent periodic northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 basis and so i think thats important for people to understand were not nudging clients in one direction or the other just talking to them about the advantages of each and so the reality is from here nii is going to be based on more than on interest rates its going to be based on volumes and volumes last quarter we were talking about the impact of qt and we were talking about taxes now this new factor thats been introduced is what is client preference between those three pillars of client liquidity and we could see that going in either direction and for us thats totally fine as long as were continuing to grow client liquidity and so its hard to model in the short run but if we think about the traditional factors fed rate increases the institutional business which is call it to of our deposits were at about beta there and thats kind of flattened out in the wealth channel the betas are meaningfully lower theyre call it to and so still with fed action thats all impacted in us dollars theres benefit from that lift still and then youve got to introduce the other factors what happens with qt and then what happens with client preference across the pillars and then from a nim perspective just the last comment ill make is that we you saw our leverage ratio is strong and its in the mid and it gives us an opportunity if we want to take advantage if theres a positive carry to do more leveraging and still maintain great liquidity for our clients thats helpful to nii but its obviously it brings down nim steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc really helpful perspective jason thanks for taking my questions jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you bet thank you steven operator we will take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well you mentioned taking tougher actions on expenses i think that showed quarteroverquarter you mentioned benefits from the industry dislocation but your expensetofee ratio is still above your to range quite a bit above so when do you think youll get there and should we look at the quarteroverquarter progression or should we think about yearoveryear because quarteroverquarter looks better than yearover year michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah mike i would say that our perspective is the same in the sense of were looking ill call it sequentially and quarteroverquarter and looking to make improvement in that and getting there both on the numerator and denominator so holding tight and trying to reduce where we can on the expense side and then growing the fee northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 side as we go through there and as youve seen if you look at it sequentially there we kind of bottomed out with the fees in the fourth quarter and now theyre up very very slightly but then depending on markets but then more importantly how we drive organic growth underneath that were looking to increase fees as we go forward on a sequential basis while at the same time having the discipline on the expense side to keep bringing that expense to trust fee ratio down operator we will take our next question from glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead mike mayo a analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi good morning a question on the other borrowing side i think most of that is wholesale funding and i know its not a huge number but its also grown to be not nothing its up and the rate paid on that is up basis points so im just looking for is that a temporary filling of the gap of the gap down in deposits how do you think about that line item intermediate term say i know you got to do what you got to do in the shortterm jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah part of it is the higher borrowing part of it is is doing more in the i think part of the reason is that the cost of that is elevated is the ficc is us doing more ficc repo for clients and just providing more liquidity options for them and the way the accounting works for that with the netting it just leads to a it makes it look like a higher cost than what it is and so were going to talk about whether maybe even to break that out separately and provide more detail in the future on it because its becoming to your exact point its just becoming a little bit larger but thats the reason you see that movement in the short run glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay yeah that would be helpful its because then its actually a distraction for you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay and then maybe big picture you talked about capturing client liquidity and you talk about it more holistically than you have in the past as money trends to money markets and treasuries how much of it is it advice versus clients just selfselecting in and are there things that you could that youre tracking to see what youre actually capturing in other words is it actually your dollars from deposits going into your money market funds as opposed to pluses and minuses come from different directions jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 yeah sure so a couple of thoughts one its were much more accurate in being able to track the money market fund than we are treasuries and let me just give an example or two to illustrate why thats the case we could and we actually did have a small number of very large institutional clients that might say might have said a quarter ago wed just like to park some money on the balance sheet wed work with them on what rate that is and then they might say for a variety of reasons we want to go to shortterm treasuries if they do that they might use if its a financial services fund it could be a hedge fund it could be an asset manager if they have a prime broker theyre more likely to use their prime broker to manage that is that really us its certainly not us losing a lot of net interest income because the pricing on the deposit is going to be really tight but difficult for us to track and really confirm where thats going the other end of the spectrum is in wealth management financial advisors are literally calling their clients and saying rates are higher youre sitting on in cash lets talk about what youd like to do with that would you like to move that into a money market fund would you like to move it into a cd would you like to start building out in letter a treasury portfolio we can track that much more accurately and so different components but in general were the statistics that we gave are biased toward the information that we can track and that we know stayed inhouse and so if theres an information bias its toward us ensuring that the numbers were telling you are reflective of what stayed here glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay i appreciate that thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator we will take our next question from brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks mike mayo a analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning maybe just staying on the for my first question just to stay on the deposit trends and the question would be as you think about that deposit pricing strategy in the wealth channel specifically how do you view raising those deposit rates versus the alternatives i guess at what point would you be inclined to just let the deposits go into the money funds or into the letters or rather you would raise rates incrementally to sort of keep those deposit wealth deposits on the balance sheet northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so the in each of the businesses there are pricing groups thats had an overall rate but there are also leaders within the regions and then down to relationship managers that have the ability to work at individual client levels to do whats right and so were always thinking about what is our overall pricing relative to peers by geographical region within wealth management even but then there are times when there are very large clients that might come with million million million and thats obviously not going to be priced off of a rate sheet were going to talk about that and the overall bias from were having conversations with clients again when were talking about what to do and if theyre going to keep a deposit looking at us versus competition they just keep it on our platform and so even though weve thrown out the beta in that to range and that may seem light its were looking at where the market is and making sure that the balance sheet again is available and making sure that were not cannibalizing the whole base of deposits in order to pick up some volume but obviously and weve talked about it from the beginning our strategic bias in wealth for deposits is keep the business on our platform brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc right thats great color and then maybe just going back to maybe an early comment that you made mike on the taking up of business given the banking stress that weve seen in march i think you mentioned billion of inflows on the wealth platform but that it was a longer term dynamic maybe if you could just sort of describe what youre seeing internally in terms of i guess thinking about i guess maybe the panic environment where clients were moving assets quickly going to a strong provider like northern or are we sort of past that phase and then what is that next phase of getting those clients because of the dislocation i guess whats the sort of the either the sales pitch in as we move to the next couple of quarters in that dynamic michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp so brian i would start by saying that the way you characterized the first phase kind of the panic phase is although we did have call it like a strong week of inflows around that time period it really wasnt a panic environment where people were pushing deposits over the counter so to speak i think there were different dynamics at play relative to other time periods and thats why i say what were seeing is more kind of the longer play out in this of ill say clients and prospects thinking about who their long term financial partner is and ensuring that its somebody that theyre comfortable is going to be there and has the strength and stability and so thats why i say its less of a blip and more of a long term ill call it trend is the way that we would see it and for us without a doubt it is playing off of our brand its playing off of the 130year history of being around and being a strong partner that as you know has been consistent for a long time in certain environments it plays better than others we think this is an environment going forward where it plays very well brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great great color thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 operator we will take our next question from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hey ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey everyone thanks coming back on the expense question i know you talked about moving the trust fees ratios positive from here the adjusted cost growth rate is the best weve seen in like six or seven quarters and im just wondering just philosophically are you thinking about managing more towards absolute levels of costs and is there a way to help us think about like how youre thinking i know its tough to generate operating leverage in this type of environment just given whats happened and what youve walked through but whats the right way to just think about absolute cost growth and how youre managing that on its own in this environment jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure its good to take a step back on this because it is how weve been talking about it internally recently and one way to frame this kind of is if you think excharges im going to because thats just the way we were not ignoring the charges but the way we talk about them internally excharges we had expense growth last year and then we dont thats not acceptable for us and we so weve got to bend that curve aggressively we know were carrying part of that forward with what we know about the impact of hiring and merit increase and offcycle adjustments given the labor environment last year but that said were targeting getting two points out of last years growth rate for the full year and in general all the expense areas are going to be addressed collectively to get to that or better expense growth rate and so well look at a couple that are notable because theyve got big movements to them one well look at comp and that looked good for first quarter you look in the second quarter we know theres about million coming out because of the seasonality of the retirement eligible grants and some other dynamics there but we also know weve got million in merit coming on line in second quarter now the incentive accrual is also in that line so and that varies with profitability and then from there everything else is going to be driven by what happens in business from hiring and other actions and expense measures and things like that and then we talked about outside services and how thats got a big step up next quarter and then maybe the last one ill highlight equipment software even though weve got that move from equipment software into outside services we can weve got clear visibility on some incremental depreciation coming on line maybe not in second quarter but in third and so you could see a million step up in that line item in second quarter but then we know weve got million in depreciation coming in third quarter so those are the big pieces at a super high level and then as well a couple of the big moves underneath it ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thats super helpful and within that or better do you have it is there an embedded impact on what current fx currency translation does there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp no not from here i mean we know we had a lift in this quarter just an elevation of lift on both revenue expense so it hurt on the expense side but not really modeling significant change from here ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and if i could ask one more time to bringitalltogether question you talked about a lot of the balance sheet changes happening towards the end of the quarter you talked about where deposits are we can see where the betas went to but do you have a way to help us understand just what the range of expectations of what you think nii can do in versus to help us put that all together jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp weve given a lot of information i would we hope to give you a really good answer on this one but i think we got to leave it with where the deposit levels are where the balances have been where the deposit levels are and then look from there on theres just so many factors moving around and particularly just client preference and were being so emphatic in saying were not going to try to nudge in any direction just provide good advice there so its hard to bind it i have to say the big factors that we see from here with volumes being down so far im hardpressed to see how we match the million of second quarter and so im going to say down but not do too much more than that to give in anticipation just given the volatility in the market about client preference and where deposits are going ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thats fair totally understood thanks jason jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure thank you ken operator we will take our next question from jim mitchell with seaport global please go ahead michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hey jim jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc good morning hey just maybe on the buyback any thoughts on with your leverage ratios improving but you did also talk about maybe using some leverage so how do we think about your thoughts on the buyback from here it was a nice uptick from what youve been doing the last five quarters northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah it was good and theres no reason we cant continue to be in the market there are a couple of things working in our favor one if weve got good return on equity and this its something like we picked up basis points basis points from net income you give up maybe half of that in dividends but we also know that were getting a lift from over time the aoci is going to pull to par and that gives a lift i think its also noteworthy the balance sheet repositioning we did it was that was accretive to cet1 because it helped reduce rwa and so those things helped and so if you think about those dynamics of what is return on equity where are we from a dividend payout ratio perspective and then the pull in the par of aoci in general it gives us some room to buy back stock while at the same time increasing cet1 to be at levels that are more consistent with if you look at our long term history were still a little bit lower than where we were and you know were always looking at where our peers and where is the competition and making sure we have good buffers but thats how were thinking about it nowadays ill tell you we do look every day we know the impact of rates on aoci and so thats a factor you should imagine were thinking about intra quarter jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats fair and then maybe just maybe a bigger picture weve talked a lot about nii on the fee side you had good flows at the end of the quarter into money market funds which is one of your higher fee rate products youre talking about perhaps increased flows in the wealth side how do we think and you had a move in the markets how do we think about total fee income any puts and takes to think about as we go forward into the next quarter and beyond jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah we talked about the we get good sense of where we are at the end of the quarter relative to the averages and so it gives us a the launch point frankly is positive relative to where we are and youre right that the money market funds in general thats an attractive fee business for us and so those all those things play in our favor but we also know markets have a really big impact and is and then also as much as we talk about we talk about organic growth in the business what happens with the markets in the short run is often the bigger driver the last thing ill mention is that in asset servicing in particular that pipeline in the short run of one not funded one not onboarded is still above historical levels and so the short run looks positive we have less visibility out late in the year but the asset servicing side still is also attractive relative to history and we gave you even more information i think on the wealth management side of the business jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay yes thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 operator we will take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning yeah good morning jason thanks for taking my questions i just want to try and make sure i understand something on expenses you had spoken to getting below expense growth and i believe that was on a number that was ex onetimers do i understand that right and what is that base on if we back out the onetimers just so i can kind of fully level set and understand how wed be really thinking about that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah its think about it as ph to be very very specific brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc that certainly is thank you jason appreciate it jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc so one more just clarifying you had chatted about how theres some noise in that other financing line that wed most usually think about as wholesale so with deposits coming down would think that youd be probably building out the wholesale at least in the near term given the quartertodate decline in the balances is that operating assumption fair and then if we were to strip out some of that ficc financing line what is that core cost to your wholesale just so we can model it appropriately when were thinking about truing up for the some of the quarter todate trends you flagged thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah and in general its going to depend on where we go in the market and how we and what sources of wholesale funding that we use and so its fhlb and sometimes were doing other sources but in general its been in the mid this past quarter and going forward i think its just think its obviously going to be impacted by rates and where and what happens with the fed and so but i think the fact that weve gotten two questions this time means well probably in the future try and give you guys a little bit more information on the impact of ficc repo and how thats impacting the borrowing costs and theres also impact on the asset side to be fair as well so well provide some more information on it brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 right thanks thatd be really helpful i would love to just do and this is a little bit of a tickytacky but id love to just do one more on expenses if you dont mind you spoke to million pickup quartertoquarter it seemed like our noncomp but million of that was just like going from one bucket to another so does that mean its like million quarteroverquarter or does that mean that million is the total step up we should think about for noncomp and then underneath the surface of that theres million moving from one bucket to another just if you could clarify that thatd be helpful jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah im going to theres a couple areas where i mentioned and so let me im going to be a little bit repetitive forgive me but itll make sure that i was clear on them because theres a couple different areas that you might have been referencing on comp no movements between buckets were thinking take the first quarter reduce it by million for the retirement eligible and some other factors that play into the incentive line and then add million for merit increase that gives you a decent starting point to say okay whats going to happen with the business going forward the second dynamic that id mentioned does have movement between line items its movement between outside services and equipment and software and theres about a million move thats going to happen in the second quarter from equipment and software into outside services outside services should be about million higher than first quarter that million includes the million from equipment and software on equipment software still think that that line item is going to be up a few million dollars in second quarter brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for walking through that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you bet operator we will take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning gerard thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone this is thomas leddy calling on behalf of gerard jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc circling back a bit on the fee side and following up a bit on alexs question earlier can you give us some color on the competitive landscape you saw this quarter and any organic growth opportunities you see as we look further into on the institutional side you guys gave some good color on the wealth side but just on the institutional side any additional color there michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hey tom the additional card give you there is that certainly highly competitive but there are quite a few opportunities that are out there so active market and i would say a lot of whats driving it is with the impact on the markets last year equity markets being down that put a lot of pressure on asset managers and as a result having them look at their operating models how they can become more efficient and looking to either outsource activities andor consolidate providers and so that has increased again the level of opportunities in the marketplace and can cut both ways i mean situations where they were advantaged but other situations where ill say were more on the defensive because its an existing client or one of two being an existing client so very active at this point and obviously trying to win more than our share thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you thats helpful and then just lastly a high level can you detail for us what an ideal environment would look like for you guys in terms of an interest rate and global markets perspective jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah its interesting i think gerard actually might have asked that exact question a few weeks ago which seems like quarters ago and my thought on that is that its first of all the trajectory the slope of the curve matters a ton and having a somewhat steeper yield curve matters a lot and secondly you want rates to be above very low and so when rates are if you call it basis points when fed funds rates are below basis points or below its just hard for us to get good return on equity and we start to play in the fee waiver land which just is not its not that we lose money in money market funds but that whole business the economics of it change a lot but then lastly the pace with which you get to any environment matters a lot and thats why a lot of banks have struggled this time its not the yield curve its the pace of change and literally months ago to today and the fed moving this aggressively in a relatively short period of time it just creates a its very tough to deal with pace so those are the three dynamics that are forefront of mind from our lens thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you thats helpful and thank you guys for taking the questions jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you bet northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 operator we will our next question from vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp hi vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi jason hi mike a couple of questions michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp hi vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc one is the head count cuts the severance that youd took in the fourth quarter have we seen that flow through yet in terms of the numbers jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp so we have actually gotten a pretty good head start on those but very little impact already in the numbers that happened later in the quarter and theres the areas of the business where they happened we just havent seen them play through very much yet some impact but light vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so should we in those numbers that you gave us should there be some benefit from that coming through jason in  or not at or or any color on that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah all along i think we said we think the meaningful impact should be visible by third quarter vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 and again remember also that when we said this is about getting jobs into the right places and so in many instances this is about transitioning jobs from lower cost from higher cost locations to lower cost locations and so well see some benefit but its not the impact of taking the roles that were exiting times the average cost theres some exit in some instances and again i think its super instructive to focus on what we mentioned earlier were thinking about the our target is to try and get that overall expense growth rate into the right level and were thinking about all of these different expense categories in aggregate to get there vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay shifting gears completely different one you talked about the ph reverse sweep i want to separate from that your other borrowings went up from about billion a year ago billion last quarter to now over billion it doesnt seem like youre making much of a spread on that any color on how we should think about that and whats driving that increase jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah thats also where the ficc repo activity is going to be reflected but vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i see not just in the repo line but on top of that in the other borrowings line too is it michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp i think in the other borrowings vivek you also have some of the federal home loan bank borrowings which during this time period we term some of those out which previously was more all overnight and just in this time period with the uncertainty wanted to add additional liquidity to the balance sheet jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah and there was about billion in that increased fhlb line item vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp thats indiscernible jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp thats sequentially not yearoveryear northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 25apr2023 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right right and youre done with that mike or are you still looking to leave some do more there michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp no well as opportunities come up for us were still contemplating it not necessarily done i mean as you know the spreads not its not extremely high there so theres a combination of liquidity management but also the spread thats available but you know what moving that from billion to billion is a big move theres also one other dynamic in that line item which is that there was some euro investment leveraging the had been up in the nonus office interestbearing line that has been reclassed into other borrowing and so thats a little over billion and so its just another dynamic to the increase that you see there but back to weve got capacity for leveraging and well continue to think about where to use it vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator that will conclude todays questionandanswer session ms childe i will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks jennifer childe senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp thank you cynthia
