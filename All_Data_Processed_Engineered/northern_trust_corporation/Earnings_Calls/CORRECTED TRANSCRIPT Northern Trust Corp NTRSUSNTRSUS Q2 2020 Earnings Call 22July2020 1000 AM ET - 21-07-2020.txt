the adversity now lets dive into the financial results for the quarter starting on page this morning we reported second quarter net income of million earnings per share were per share and our return on average common northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 equity was as you can see on the bottom of page the macroeconomic environment was mixed during the quarter while equity markets performed well during the quarter recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels and thus the current quarters fees were unfavorably impacted by the lagged market performance interest rates have of course declined significantly with onemonth and threemonth libor rates down sequentially as well as versus the prior year lets move to page and review the financial highlights of the second quarter yearoveryear revenue on an fte basis was flat with noninterest income up and net interest income down expenses increased the provision for credit losses was million in the current quarter net income was down in a sequential comparison revenue declined with noninterest income down and net interest income down expenses decreased net income declined the provision for credit losses of million during the quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve evaluated on a collected basis driven by downgrades in the portfolio and the more severe projected economic conditions the largest increases are within the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate portfolios underlying credit metrics remained strong during the quarter with net recoveries of million and a decline in nonaccrual assets which totaled million at quarter end return on average common equity was for the quarter down from a year ago and in the prior quarter assets under custodyadministration of trillion grew from a year ago and increased on a sequential basis assets under custody of trillion grew from a year ago and increased on a sequential basis assets under management are trillion up from a year ago and up on a sequential basis now lets look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page second quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis is billion flat compared to last year and down sequentially trust investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled million and were up from last year and down sequentially foreign exchange trading income was million in the quarter up yearoveryear and down sequentially the increase compared to a year ago was driven by higher volatility and increased volumes while the sequential decline was mainly due to lower volumes the remaining components of other noninterest income totaled million in the quarter up compared to one year ago and up sequentially securities commissions and trading income increased compared to a year ago and was down sequentially the yearoveryear growth was driven by success within our integrated trading solutions product as well as higher referral fees and interest rate swap the sequential decline was driven by lower interest rate swap activity and core brokerage other operating income increased compared to the prior year and sequentially both increases were impacted by higher income associated with supplemental compensation plans and a higher market value adjustment for seed capital investment partially offset by higher visa swap expense the yearoveryear performance also benefited from income related to a bankowned life insurance program that was implemented during the higher income on the supplemental compensation plans resulted in a related increase in staff related expense within other operating expenses net interest income which ill discuss in more detail later was million in the second quarter down from one year ago and down sequentially northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 lets look at components of our trust investment fees on page for our corporate and institutional services business fees totaled million in the second quarter and were up yearoveryear and down sequentially custody and fund administration fees the largest component of cis fees were million and down yearoveryear and down on a sequential basis the yearoveryear performance was primarily driven by unfavorable lagged markets and currency translation partially offset by new business and transaction fees the sequential decline was primarily driven by unfavorable lagged markets as well as the decline from currency translation partially offset by new business and transaction fees assets under custodyadministration for cis clients were trillion at quarter end up yearoveryear and up sequentially the yearoveryear performance reflected new business and favorable market impact partially offset by unfavorable currency translation the sequential performance was driven by higher market levels new business and unfavorable currency translation recall that lagged market values factor into the quarters fees with both quarter lagged and month lagged markets impacting our cis custody and fund administration fees investment management fees in cis of million in the second quarter were up yearoveryear and up sequentially both the yearoveryear and sequential performance was driven by strong flows within our money market fund assets under management for cis clients were billion up yearoveryear and up sequentially both the prioryear and sequential comparisons were impacted by strong flows as well higher markets during the quarter similar to custody and fund administration fees note that lagged market values factor into cis investment management fees securities lending fees were million during the quarter up yearoveryear and up sequentially the yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by higher spreads and slightly higher volumes while the sequential increase was primarily driven by higher spreads particularly in the beginning of the quarter securities lending collateral was billion at quarter end and averaged billion across the quarter average collateral levels increased yearoveryear and were down sequentially moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were million in the second quarter and were down compared to the prioryear quarter and down sequentially both the year overyear and sequential performance were impacted by unfavorable lagged markets for the yearoveryear comparison new business partially offset the market decline both market lag and quarter lag asset levels impact wealth management fees assets under management for our wealth management clients were billion at quarter end up yearover year and up sequentially the yearoveryear growth was driven by net flows while the sequential increase was driven by favorable markets and net flows moving to page net interest income was million in the second quarter and down from the prior year earning assets averaged billion in the quarter up versus the prior year average deposits were billion and were up versus the prior year the net interest margin was in the quarter and was down basis points from a year ago the net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower short term interest rates as well as mix shift within the balance sheet on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was down average earning assets increased on a sequential basis the growth in the balance sheet was driven by a sequential increase in average deposits northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 the net interest margin declined basis points driven by the impact of lower rates as well as mix shift within the balance sheet looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the quarter us dollar deposits represented of our total average deposits which was up from one year ago and up in the prior quarter as we look at the third quarter the impact of lower rates particularly libor will be more fully reflected in our run rate both onemonth and threemonth libor have come down significantly from their second quarter averages based on our current view of the balance sheet volume and libor levels continuing at the current levels we expect third quarter net interest income to be down to on a sequential basis turning to page expenses were billion in the second there second quarter and were higher than the prior year and lower than the prior quarter compensation expense totaled million and was up compared to one year ago and down sequentially the yearoveryear growth was driven by higher salary expense due to staff growth and base pay adjustments partially offset by lower cashbased incentive accruals and lower longterm performancebased equity incentive the sequential decline was primarily driven by lower cost associated longterm performancebased incentive compensation due to divesting provisions associated with grants to retirement eligible employees in the prior quarter as well as lower cashbased incentive accruals partially offset by higher salaries driven by base pay adjustment employee benefit expense of million is up from one year ago and down sequentially both the year overyear and sequential comparisons were impacted by lower payroll taxes and lower medical cost the year overyear comparison was impacted by higher retirement costs relating to pensions expense outside services costs over of million were down on a yearoveryear basis and down sequentially the yearoveryear decline was driven by lower cost across a number of categories including data processing thirdparty advisor fees consulting and subcustodian fees partially offset by higher technical services the sequential decline which primarily due to lower technical services cost and thirdparty advisor fees equipment and software expensive of million was up from one year ago and up sequentially the yearoveryear growth reflected higher depreciation and amortization and software support costs the sequential increase is driven by modest increases in software and equipment rental support and maintenance cost occupancy expense of million increased from a year ago and was up sequentially the yearover year growth was driven by higher rent and the building operation cost related to our workplace real estate strategies the sequential increase was primarily related to a million reduction recorded in the prior quarter resulting from a lease renegotiation other operating expense of million was up from one year ago and up sequentially both of the increases were driven by higher staffrelated expenses and higher charges associated with account servicing activities partially offset by lower business promotion expenses due to reduced business travel the higher staff related costs were related to an increase in supplemental compensation plan expenses and resulted in a related increase in other operating income turning to page our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier ratio of under the standardized approach and under the advanced approach the second quarter increase in the common equity tier ratio was driven in large part by a decline in risk weighted assets as financial market conditions stabilized versus  northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 additionally the absence of share repurchases allowed further capital accretion from net income and other comprehensive income from the investment securities portfolio our tier leverage ratio was under both standardized and advanced approaches during the second quarter we declared cash dividends of per share totaling million to common stockholder as announced yesterday our board of directors approved our third quarter dividend of per common share as a result of the stress test published by the federal reserve at the end of june our stress capital buffer requirement for the capital plan cycle was set at the stress capital buffer is effective october and results in a common equity tier capital ratio minimum requirement of its times like these that show the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to support our clients activities and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise they come to expect our competitive position in wealth management asset management and asset servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace thank you again for participating in northern trust second quarter earnings conference call today mike mark lauren and i would be happy to answer your questions jennifer will you please open the line question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well go first to alex blostein with goldman sachs michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp hi alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys thanks for taking the question so i guess my first question is related to money market funds im curious if you guys can give us your latest thoughts on outlook for money market fee levers it doesnt look like theres really anything in the quarter so far but clearly rates have come down quite meaningful so to frame this maybe as you think about the current prevailing market rate and second quarter money market fund balances if youre going to go through the repricing mechanism can you give us a sense what the few areas could be as we look out over the next two quarters mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp sure alex so first of all youre right the quarter doesnt have a lot and so let me give you a couple of facts and then ill get to what the outlook could look like so first of all in second quarter waivers were less than million as we think about the current run rate as we sit today there are about million a quarter that said were going to start to see this ramp a little bit as the portfolio gets repriced and so as we look out to the end of fourth quarter and even into next year assuming rates stay the way they are today we could see waivers getting in the million to million a quarter range northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 now those are the facts i also want to just provide a little bit of kind of significant framework to your question about how people should think about it weve got a lot of growth in the money market bond business obviously we talked about that earlier and even if you look at the treasury fund thats among the top three in size and investment returns in the universe its grown from it was at billion at yearend and its about billion today overall overall the complex has about funds and they totaled billion to billion in aggregate now that whole complex is geared towards a very institutional and high net worth client base thats very important to realize because it means the pricing on average is lower than a retail complex that complex of fund has a fee rate ranging in general think about it basis points to basis points there are exceptions on either side but thats where the bulk of the assets are if i take those funds and boil it down to the ones that are most likely to have waivers theres really a handful or halfdozen funds that have both large aum but also have yields that are within basis points to basis points for the fee those handful of funds total billion plus or minus the gross yield on those funds is about basis points and the stated fee on them probably basis points now each one of those strategies is different in expected yields and fees and so thats just a highlevel guide to give you a sense of how good the overall complex might come in the fee waiver mode as they reprice the portfolio but thats all given two caveats one the existing yield curve stays the way it is and secondly there are times when we will do promotional pricing in some of those funds the analysis i just went through with you excludes that this is purely waivers based on yield curve coming down alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thats super helpful mark thanks for giving all the info there and just i guess to clarify the million to million that you mentioned on thats a gross revenue impact are there any expense offset that are kind of more direct related to that before you guys take any action from an expense perspective that we should be mindful as well or the revenue impact is pretty much the pretax impact mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp super minor super minor should really think about that that gross impact has been pretty full alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great second question around nir and appreciate the guidance for the third quarter given the shortterm nature of northerns balance sheet im just curious to think about how the trajectory could evolve from there so is most of the repricing going to be balanced around  so that would actually really be pretty close to trough nir for the business or if you guys think theres incremental pressure again there thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so on provision in general actually let me give you a couple numbers and then i actually think itd be helpful to provide a sense of kind of the process because i think thats important the good and bad of cecl is that its a very forwardlooking mechanism and so lets try to separate the credit results from the most factual to the ones that are more forecastdependent northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 so we start on the factual side and on the extreme you just say were going to look at chargeoffs and we had million in net recovery in the quarter so chargeoffs were actually benefit of million if you come in from that spectrum the next thing you look at from a quantitativeonly factor basis would be what are nonperformings look like and even there nonperformings were down million in the quarter and they currently are less than million on a billion billion billion loan portfolio so its just basis points of loan and then next even look at delinquencies and delinquencies in the period were actually down and so all of the factors that are most quantitative only are all in very good shape but then you start to look further down the spectrum what are the qualitative related factors and what drove our increase in provision in our overall provision for the quarter were two big factors one downgrades in the portfolio that added about million to the reserve and then secondly the macro scenario which added million to million and so all of the increase that weve had is related to more of these qualitative factors and even the downgrades for instance is where our credit team is looking and trying to be forward looking about organizations industries dynamics that they think are going to reflect credit quality so thats the background on how the provision number wound up but lauren you spend a lot of time on this why dont you give seconds on governance and process lauren e allnutt a controller northern trust corp sure jason thanks the provision methodology goes through a very robust governance process which builds upon best practices that weve developed in other internal forecasting exercises governance covers everything from the data that is used to validation problems to the forecast assumption to the ultimate provision outflow there are many levels of review and challenge throughout the quarterly process with specification from multiple disciplines around the company such as economic research credit risk treasury foreign exchange controllers and expertise from our business units so weve unfortunately had ample opportunity to pressure test this process over the last two quarters and be still confident that the governance is robust and produces a reserve that is not only well supported but also responsive to the changing economic operator well go next to mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp next question operator yes well go next to ken usdin with jefferies mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 hey thanks good morning jason question on net interest income so understanding the reset of libor into the third quarter and the guidance that you gave can you give us a sense of whether or not third quarter gets you towards stabilization of nii and if rates hold similar from here do you have any thoughts on how third to fourth would look thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure yeah we have looked at that frankly closely and the answer is that it does get us very very close to flattening out and so let me ill just provide a couple of thoughts to give you a little bit more color on that guide if we take the million that we announced and the to down it gives you kind of a million to million down i think its important for people to realize how much libor has come down in the first quarter it averaged million in april it was basis points in may it was basis points in june it averaged basis points so really flattening out and as of today its kind of at that 18basis point level as we sit midjuly and so its very much flattened out at basis points but then you got to compare that to what the average was across second quarter and the average across second quarter was basis points and so you just think about a loan portfolio of billion billion were assuming some of that comes out and weve already seen you can see from the average thats in the release and the period end and i can tell you today were sitting just under billion in loans and so if we come down a little bit more we might see billion billion maybe billion in loan decline you take an 18basis point differential between second quarter and third quarter on that and that in and of itself is going to get you over million in the million decline and then you start to look at just the impact of the volume coming down million rates in itself again million and then just in the loan book youd end up with million in decline and then you got to look at the securities book and there you got billion to billion in securities theyre repricing and the dynamics here that youre getting at is that a lot of the repricing is actually starting to happen now were experiencing it now and we expect it less going forward and so we think third quarter is going to be the significant decline and then we should start to see very very much a level off maybe not but very close to fully leveled off going forward from there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks for that color and on the expense side with the decline in nii and then the fee waivers coming thats a lot of kind of highmargin revenues that wont be around next year on a run rate basis you guys have done a good job getting the cost growth rate down to but how do you think about the dynamic not so much an operating leverage but just about absolute cost levels and cost growth and what levers are there to pull how are you thinking about that as well thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so maybe looking at page of the release you kind of where i always go to just think about how things are moving and if you look at that first of all you get a sense and to your point things have on an aggregate level leveled off at i will say in general as you know we went through a very full replan that stripped out northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 call it around million in expenses just to be open about it and some of that was predictable from the macro environment but some of it wasnt we then went through a full capital investment replan and then finally just this past week we reviewed with our board a strategic replan a strategic plan replan and so were taking this environment extremely seriously and the value per spend we hit it the million target was reached but the foundations of that are far from over were talking about it all the time its very much embedded culturally and if you are here i think youd get a sense that the priorities here are around first in this resiliency mode that mike talked about safety to resilience and preparation and support of clients and then third expense discipline so if you look at page of the release and it details in the nie and you can see how a lot of these line items have flattened out even comp which is down a lot you take out the equity incentive from first quarter offset by days pay adjustment that line item flattening and employee benefits when you see across the board some leveling in these areas and all i can say at this point just laser focus on it value for spend has not stopped and we understand that in this environment organic revenue growth is going to be its going to be hard money in motion is less there are less rfps that are going to be tossed into the environment and so we have to ensure were focusing in a laserlike fashion on expenses ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks jason jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator well go next to mike carrier with bank of america michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc good morning mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp hi mike michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc thank you for taking the question hi yeah maybe just on the given the covid environment the workfrom home just trying to get some color on the impact its having on client activity obviously transactional activity has been strong but more in terms of new business you mean that youre seeing significant delays or the pipeline still building and its just the kind of prolonged implementation just trying to get a sense on how much of a drag the environment is creating on the new business northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure maybe ill start with a couple headlines and then be really good to hear from mike on this so particularly on if i just split it on the wealth side lost business is down and i think thats really important to realize not that it was ever large but it just gives a reflection that everything weve done engagement weve had with clients the cemented relationships theyre doing weekly online client events that are called insight goalsdriven wealth management is a great technology to be able to engage with clients very customized approach in live time on video and its going well if i give just one anecdotal advice i was talking to the head of our central region last night and he was talking about this ultrahigh net worth client that has a split relationship with us and one other institution they had a session with them that explore how to take advantage of the low of low market values and low interest rates they work with very complex but unique wealth transfer opportunity with his kids and grandchildren he executed it he was thrilled hes consolidated his whole relationship now at northern because he feels like were the trusted adviser and he wants us to have a better lens in this whole financial picture and then on the cis side mike we mentioned really early even things like integrated trading solutions starting to come on board pete cherecwich talked about onboarding new wins just in that environment and so some good news there but also some caution about what the future holds in terms of rfp mike michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure i would just add to it that if you start with the question of whether theres still a need for the service and what we do and the demand for it frankly thats not only there but in many respect has gone up in this environment so theres pressure on every company and institution thats out there and so just as we talk about how can we become more efficient how do we rethink our operating model well our clients are doing the same thing and then often presents opportunities for us primarily around things like outsourced services whether its on the trading front or its in the middle office so the demand is there for the services and then second i would say a static analysis would tell you that the environment changes but the way that we are our clients and prospects go about things dont change but the fact of the matter is people adapt and so in the same way that we at northern went from doing things in person and then maybe conference calls now as you know everythings on video and in the same way with the search process the rfp process the due diligence process these activities have moved to online or and some of it virtual so that they can continue so as much as its a different environment and it presents new challenges i would say that weve changed the prospect and client base has changed and as a result its just a different set of opportunity michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc okay thats helpful and then just one followup just given your strong capital position and then some clarity on the right structure with the scb whats the macro backdrop does it get better in the industry has more profitability and clarity so how are you guys thinking about capital management including maybe a cet1 internal or management minimum or buffer maybe investing in new growth areas and capital return jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 sure well we always take our capital levels not just as a single topic but we think about it in conjunction with the with our overall engagement strategy our approach to the market and so we want to ensure that as we look across peers thats one lens to make sure we look good on that basis and then we also are talking big about the regulatory environment and the optics of what to do there and then we have very meaningful engagement with our board of directors and about what we should do from a capital perspective and i think even these past several months has given indication that coming into an environment like what we experienced with strong capital level it helps us not just in the short run but it provides really good illustration for clients and prospect of what a strong balance sheet means for us as we compete in the market michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc okay thanks a lot operator well go next to jim mitchell with seaport global mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp hi jim james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just a quick followup on your thoughts on deposit trends so far in the quarter i hear your sort of nii guide overall but help maybe you can help us more specifically on the balance sheet it seems like deposits have been sticking and how you think about the prospects for growth in a zero rate environment jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah but first of all on that youre right i mean deposits are sticking and i dont think i mentioned earlier but even post close of the period deposits are sticking at the same level so if you look at our balance sheet and add the interestbearing deposits plus the dda youd still see us somewhere at billion range and billion to billion were still actually at that level now that in some way is a good news and that drives the size of the balance sheet for sure that determines how were going to end the quarter at billion it has much less of an impact on nii and nim on the margin as we have that incremental dollar coming in its often going to go into ioer at the fed at basis points or even if its in another currency its going to go to a central bank deposit with not a lot on it and thats why they keep coming back to trying to encourage people to look at and start to predict whats going to happen with loan volume and rates and super importantly the info that that miniwalk forward i went through earlier its super dependent on rate being the way they are today everything were talking about is now we were predicting accurately a decline in libor as we said days ago at this point were assuming that libor is flat from here and it has leveled out hopefully it doesnt compress relative to fed fund if that happens things will change but the deposits will absolutely impact the size of the balance sheet much less of an impact on nim and nii northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay makes sense and then maybe just a question on wealth i know thats an area that you guys have been targeting for accelerating organic growth i think if you look at this quarter the market impact it was hard to kind of see a lot of organic growth there how i guess maybe just give us an update on how that effort to kind of accelerate growth and wealth is working maybe its being slowed by covid thats it just curious jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp well to start we tended we intend to look at organic growth on a yearoveryear basis and much less on a quartertoquarter basis just because its such a tight timeframe on closed cycles that happen over a longer period of time secondly to your point within wealth specifically the theme id want you to take away is that the gfo business is continuing to be the driver of growth there and the regions are growing less quickly and over short periods of time might even show the areas of decline nothing that were worried about from a strategic perspective but within wealth gfo certainly the area thats continuing to grow more james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator well go next to brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc all right great thanks good morning folks maybe just to a lot of color on the net interest rate which i appreciate that jason just i think within a quarter but if i recall some you repriced with a lag of i think its three to four quarters but if you could just talk about that and whether we could see some repricing down the road based on that if thats true jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah in general you think about that portfolio is about floating and again either 30day libor day libor or prime and youve mentioned yield at the beginning which is something i actually im not sure i mentioned earlier but i think it might be helpful because i would imagine you guys are going to try and predict to dissect the balance sheet think about a yield in that component of the balance sheet very roughly around basis points and so as you think about the impact of converting if we do have a decline in loan and we see loan volume coming down and you think on that if that has to be reinvested in ioer think about it that type of difference in yield northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thats helpful jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thats why yeah go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc no go ahead jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp which is thats why this thats why this dynamic of looking at loan volume is still important because the conversion of a dollar of loan to the alternative investment is significant brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great right that makes still a sense and then if you just walk through some of the uncommon oneoff items but things that influenced this other operating income and other operating expenses just trying to get a sense of what more normal run rate is for there too instead of comparing on an yearoveryear or quarter or sequential quarter growth basis maybe just turn to give an absolute basis of what drove those two line items you had million and the million on the other expenses jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah well ill do the expense side mark maybe you can do the revenue side but on the other operating expense side weve got the supplemental comp there and then weve also got when we have account servicing losses thats where that line item shows up and then business promotion travel entertainment those are the big buckets i think about for other operating expense mark do you want to do the other side mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah brian this is mark one thing to keep in mind is in the first quarter if we talk about other operating income we had a negative drag from the seed investment marktomarket that kind of came back this quarter similarly with the supplemental compensation plan that impact both income and expense a negative last quarter because of the mark a pretty significant positive this quarter so one way again and that i think weve talked about this a little bit and one way you could almost average look at the first and second quarter on other operating income more as an average but you do have other things like hedging and list of related things that happened there but if you were to look at the average over time and i think we it kind of holds true youre about in the mid now that the boli program that we put in place is at a full run rate as of the first quarter and continues to that in the second quarter if you strip out the items weve called out over time and look at the average youre probably more in the mid which is actually close to what the yeartodate average for the other operating income would be as well northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great and the seed capital positive mark was how much in the quarter mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah million brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc million and then just lastly on the outside services i forgot to ask on that one too on that line item anything one time in there or basically from a run rate basis i guess jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc given we got the drop from to mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp i wouldnt necessarily call out anything one time that line will move around certainly i think some of the drag impact we saw on the revenue side that are a little bit lagged that benefited us on outside services to a certain extent this quarter so i dont know that i would look at this quarter as a run rate and jason i dont know if you would add anything to that but i nothing onetime necessarily to call out but certainly there were some things that went our way but the revenue linked line about the thirdparty adviser fees jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah nothing to add operator well go next to brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question i actually just wanted to follow up a little on that because the outside services expense line looked a little funky it seems like what youre saying is that the run rate this is not the right run rate we should instead does that mean we should instead look at like the average of the past four quarters and can you give a little bit more color on some of the drivers of the downside to the quarter you said like thirdparty advisory fees is that what you meant mark when you said the lag effect as in there was a lag to the rally there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp right right i mean theres a few things that we had some of the market data cost that we had were down again some of that ends up being timing from our data processing cost we had consulting expense was down during the quarter so its hard to it was a pretty favorable quarter there its just hard to pin down but thats the new run rate going forward because those will have some fluctuation to them certainly consulting based on timing of engagement et cetera brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then when were thinking about investing services and strength there could you parse that out a little bit was that timing too or was there something more sustainable causing that mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp youre asking about the increase in investment management revenue and cis brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yes mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah so it is an important dynamic i think it really has added i think to the base of business and so first of all i hinted earlier the treasury funds but in that business its not just that weve had closed in the asset management business done a lot over the last five years to position the business for growth and the liquidity fund and first of all investment most everything starts and ends with investment performance and their investment performance has been top five over the last several months secondly size and clients there want to ensure that theyre investing in a fund thats got large size to it so that they dont represent a high percentage if they feel better about the liquidity funds the treasury fund set is billion they worked on cutoff times to ensure theyre more competitive theyve hired a dedicated distribution team theyve launched a portal and thats up to almost billion in assets and a decent amount of that is with northern product and then theyve reapproached the thirdparty portal to ensure when treasurers are looking at opportunities to park cash we look very appealing and so if you think about the increase that weve had there the treasury and focusing a lot on the treasury funds because thats where a lot of the growth has happened but just in the last quarter the billion billion in growth into those strategies about billion of it was on the institutional side and those funds are basis points to basis points and so very very meaningful and now the flipside to it is those are part of that watch list that i referenced earlier that it could be part of fee waivers and so were trying to maintain humility about what that might look like but the very good news is that the base of business there has increased significantly northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay and thanks for predicting my followup about the fee waiver so appreciate that mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp absolutely operator well go next to betsy graseck with morgan stanley mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning can you hear me michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp we got you well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh okay thanks i had two questions first on deposits i think average deposits in the quarter was up somewhere in the teens but end of the period was down i know you traditionally say like typically say dont look at end of period but wanted to understand how we should think about deposit growth over the next quarter at least if not we will further out what we could talk about the drivers of what the deposit growth has been seemed to be fading so i would think it slows down but would like to get your understanding of them jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so youre right we were kind of in the teens in the one teens and its held in there and you watch it on a daily basis and were still seeing deposits at around that level and so often well see a significant decline from quarter end and certainly saw some come down but have seen it level off around that level we are still anticipating that over time our clients will look to put some of that money to work in more risk on trades northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 and ill come back to what i mentioned earlier that it is important to watch to the extent youre trying to predict the size of the balance sheet but those deposits particularly that layer that we think is not necessarily as sticky doesnt have as much of an impact on nii or nim betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah and what percentage of the deposits is that in your opinion thats not as sticky jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thats really hard to tell i mean its and you go back to maybe the beginning of the year and we saw client deposits in the ph mid80 in billions and so at absolute worst case scenario you could take the delta there but a lot of our clients are clearly exhibiting more stability and stickiness at least thus far betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc because the stickier the more operational you can take duration with that so i guess im wondering how much of the deposit inflow that youve gotten over the past quarter or so has been deemed operational and put into duration versus over the next quarter or two would there be incremental opportunity to extend duration with deposits if they stick around more than expected jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah some of that determination of whether theyre operational or not is actually a timed task and we talked about those deposits having to season and so we cant make a prediction or determination absent this time but youre right in that at a point we can start to leg out on those or go into nonhqla and think about term and credit and achieve more at that point we did talk on the last call about the fact that we wanted to be patient about doing that to ensure we werent in a situation where we couldnt be there for clients if particularly loan demand increased significantly betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and what kind of time test is it like is it three months six months is that a range you can share with us jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp it depends on different tests and also theyre tested different if its a retail deposit versus if its institutional and so betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah so theres a range depending on which type jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 and even within the institutional side the type of depositor also influences the categorization of it and then on the wealth side the size so theres a lot of different factors that go into it its not a single test just based on time betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc but should my takeaway be there is opportunity to extend duration if deposits meet the time test as we go into and or not jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes there is opportunity there i certainly wouldnt think about it as million minus million that volume level but there would be some opportunity to identify situations where we would want to extend more betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then just my other followup question is regarding just the agency rmbs when i think about the securities book and where spreads could compress further agency rmbs kind of goes to the top of the list because we recently got to i think historic lows in the mortgage rates so im wondering how much did agency rmbs yields compression impact your second quarter results how much is it contributing to the outlook you have for third quarter nii decline just to get a sense there would be helpful jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure im not sure weve done that level of detail about the exposure in yield in that book so we wouldnt want to comment on it and a yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thank you operator well go next to glenn schorr with evercore jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc thanks very much hello there okay so we hear you loud and clear on your comments all around net interest income little loan demand and low yields in the public market but and youre not alone there but many investors whether it be pension funds wealth funds insurance companies theyve looked to the private credit northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 markets for a source of yield you might have to give up some liquidity but not necessarily taking on the worst credit youre probably the most conservative management team ive ever met but curious if you put thought into the private credit markets jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah we look at a very broad range of asset classes that we consider for investment and yeah at that point theres such a focus on ensuring that we are there for clients were not just were not taking incremental risk because the yield curve has come down and i think thats the prevailing theme as we said and think from an investment strategy perspective that said were constantly thinking about risk and return and also the categorization of the different asset classes and whether theyre hqla nonhqla level and trying to come up with a mosaic of thinking about and evaluating those opportunities on a risk and regulatory adjusted basis but at this point we want to make sure were not looking to grab yield just because the yield curve has come down glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc im with you okay just a followup you mentioned the growth in sec lending and we can see that go up in your quarteronquarter you mentioned spread as being a big impact some of the spread there have come in can you talk maybe about an exit rate or a forward thought on sec lending for both spreads and volumes as we look forward from second quarter jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah and its interesting i mean youre right i mean at the beginning of the quarter the spreads were much wider and frankly volumes werent great and then as we got later in the quarter the spreads started to thin the volume came back i think as clients felt more comfortable and so its a tricky dynamic to triangulate and i think the volumes and the spreads are actually correlated and so its hard to give a sense right now of where that ends up landing mark i dont know if you have other thoughts on it mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp one thing you can look at is the threemonth libor versus overnight and if you plot that out you would certainly see this like weve been seeing earlier in the quarter particularly early april was a significant benefit there and then were exiting the quarter certainly at a much tighter spread there so that will be one way to look at it glenn jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp and our view is libor really since may and june so and 90day libor has flattened out glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc yeah okay thank you for all that operator well go next to rob wildhack with autonomous research northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp good morning guys a little bit more of a big picture question i think back to the fourth quarter earnings call when you talked about a demand for increase scalability from some of your larger clients and i was hoping you could give us an update on your efforts there and what youve been done and are doing to kind of meet that demand michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure its mike ill take that absolutely a critical objective for our business ill say overall but particularly within asset services and so we are ill say battling out every day to make sure we can provide continuity of service for our clients as jason and mark have gone through here and try and navigate the financial environment but at the same time we are looking forward two three four five years ahead with the business model trying to determine how can we not only take care of clients and what their needs are but build in more productivity into the business model and as you have highlighted thats going to be through scalability particularly in asset servicing and on that front weve made investments that have begun to change the nature of the way that that business will operate and what i mean by that is primarily our investments have been in what were calling matrix our matrix platform which essentially is a data driven architecture that essentially takes all of the data in through one place if you will ensures that that is clean accurate data if you will and then from there were able to utilize it in multiple platform for multiple services and it also shifts the service model to one that right now requires a fair number of employees to provide that service to a model where theres more either automation in how things happen or how theyre processed but also selfservice and selfservice in a way that is a positive from a client satisfaction perspective that they dont need to call in or fax in or email in a transaction or order anything like that but rather they can put it in and it gets processed essentially straight through so that improves both the efficiency of what were doing the scalability because we can put more business on it but also the accuracy and consistency and reliability of how we process so were pretty optimistic on that we have rolled out two releases over the last several months here despite the environment so that continues to progress robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp thanks mike just quickly the integration you announced with blackrock and aladdin would you bucket that as part of that scalability goal and then i know its early but any sense for how clients are responding to the partnership so far michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah broadly speaking i absolutely would put that in the same its a part of the same strategy because what were doing with blackrock in that case is essentially further integration with aladdin provider in which case by being more directly connected it provides greater efficiency so whats happening between our platforms if you will in aladdin is directly linked in which case you get the same types of benefits that i just talked about there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp all right thank you operator well go next to vivek juneja with jpmorgan jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hey vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my question a quick one which is just an update on the northern trust open given the environment should we expect a similar kind of increase as youve guided to in the past any color on that and then i have a bigger picture question jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp headline is that we wont see a significant decline relative to prior years and we typically see million million sequential increase in business promo as we look into the quarter a few thoughts on it one the tournament is going to be players only as you know secondly we dont get any specific cost about the tournament but people should know most of the costs associated with the tournament are about television and the expenses related to tournament production and those actually arent going to come down significantly and then the reality is that the television ratings for pga have actually been very very good and so there will be a modest savings as we think about reduction in travel and entertainment and some other things but the reduction wont be meaningful vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc shifting gears to a bigger picture question as i look out over the last year and if youd look forward if you think about your mix of asset services clients what does that look like by type of client pension fund versus longonly versus insurance versus hedge funds and what levels what is that mix and what is the change youve seen over the past year or two and what do you expect to see michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp so ill take it and im going to do this vivek without a specific breakdown with the numbers and percentages of our client base because i dont have it in front of me but generally speaking over the last several years and that will continue through to last year the proportion of our business that is coming from asset managers as opposed to asset owners has gone up thats been a combination of just the business strategy over time but also because the demands of asset managers for our types of services have been growing at a higher rate from a market perspective and then also as you know were taking share as we continue to expand that business both geographically but also within particular segments so geographically if you think about what we did in luxembourg and switzerland that primarily is going to drive business with asset managers and then switzerland is a mix between asset managers and asset owners so northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 thats where our focus has been and thats where the greater growth has come from the thing i would say about the asset owner side and subsegments within that it really does vary with whats happening across the globe just broader macro factors because as you would expect things like sovereign wealth funds and governments were working with them their needs to deploy investments into the economy changes over time versus their ability to invest those and its when theyre invested globally that we see higher asset levels from them and its when they deploy them into the economy that theyll reduce those levels so its just a higher level of variability and i would just add sorry vivek one other thing vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc no go ahead yeah michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp is just and then in the us where the asset owners are largely pension funds that dynamic its more of a share game than it is a market growth game and so there again weve been able to pick up share but youre doing it in a slower growing market vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah mike any plans to break this kind of data out at least once a year in your 10k or something could you give us a sense of where youre growing and providing a little more granularity michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp vivek thats definitely something we can take on to consider because obviously its something that we track closely so if we can do it in a reliable way its something well consider vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator well go next to brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for taking my followup just wanted to come back to expenses in the second half some of those were answered with the golf open but typically we do see that seasonal increase in the second half and the outside services and certainly equipment and software expense so just wanted to check in and see if you still think thats the case obviously with the covid environment that could be fluid this time around but i just wonder if youre checking on that especially since we saw the downtick in outside services in the second quarter northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2020 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah couple of things one youre right in that there are some theres some balance in this so on one hand theres covidrelated expenses that are impacting things a lot weve got investments to make there some of that will come through in capital but some of it will come through the income statement as weve spent decently at this point and continuing to ensure that in a resiliency mode were doing everything we can to make sure were there for clients secondly we want to make sure that were investing appropriately and in a disciplined way particularly around things like technology and some of that will show up in outside services some of it shows up in equivalent software but some of it will show up in outside services and so this is a weve got a high bar for where were investing but the traditional view of what expense ramps look like in the third and fourth quarter i think are going to be less reliable its much more about what we think is necessary to ensure resiliency and our strategy of being there for client brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats good color and then just lastly the standard provisioning and thanks for all the color on that you talked about some internal downgrades across the book i guess just as we go into the second half as well if we do have a situation where theres a second wave of covid19 thats hopefully not but worse than people are expecting is that a significant part of your credit assessment even if you think the credit qualities credit assessment even if you think the credit qualities are relatively good but nevertheless could drive higher provisioning in the second half jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp weve run multiple macro scenarios and some of those scenarios will incorporate t type of worsening or wtype as opposed to a v so as things approach we play with the weight of those factors and that has heavy influence on what the output is and so we monitor that closely if things worsened significantly just like what we experienced last quarter frankly things worsened from the end of march to the beginning of april and this time we havent seen that type of dynamic shift between the end of the quarter and the time were talking to you but theres so much time between now and then were reliant on what those macro forecasts look like and theyll always have influence particularly in the seasonal environment on what provision looks like brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks for all the color on that i appreciate it jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator and at this time there are no further questions northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript
