stakeholders no matter the adversity now lets delve into the financial results for the quarter starting on page this morning we reported first quarter net income of million earnings per share were and our return on common equity was you can see on the bottom of page the macroeconomic environment became more challenging during the first quarter however recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels and thus the current quarters fees do not fully reflect the impact of the decline in equity markets during the quarter northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 lets move to page and review the financial highlights of the first quarter yearoveryear revenue on an fte basis increased with noninterest income up and net interest income down expenses increased the provision for credit losses was million in the quarter while net income was up in a sequential comparison revenue increased with noninterest income up and net interest income down expenses decreased while net income declined the provision for credit losses of million during the quarter was primarily due to an increase in the reserve driven by current and projected economic conditions resulting from the ongoing pandemic and the related market and economic impacts the largest increase in the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate portfolios return on average common equity was for the quarter down from a year ago and in the prior quarter assets under custodyadministration of trillion were flat compared to a year ago and were down on a sequential basis assets under custody of trillion were up compared to a year ago and down sequentially assets under management were trillion down on a yearoveryear basis and down on a sequential basis lets look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page first quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was billion up compared to last year and up sequentially trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue reaching a record billion in the first quarter up from last year and up sequentially foreign exchange trading income was million in the first quarter up yearoveryear and up sequentially the increase is primarily due to higher client volumes and increased market volatility during the month of march remaining components of other noninterest income were million in the first quarter up compared to a year ago and up sequentially securities commissions and trading income increased compared to a year ago and sequentially driven by higher interest rate swap and core brokerage related revenue prior quarter other operating income included a million loss relating to the sale of leases excluding this prior period loss the sequential decline was primarily due to lower income associated with supplemental compensation plans and a market value adjustment for a seed capital investment partially offset by lower visa related swap expense and the impact of a full quarter run rate of the bankowned life insurance program on a yearoveryear basis these categories increased primarily due to the bankowned life insurance program implemented during and lower visa swap related expense partially offset by the market value adjustment for a seed capital investment and lower income relating to supplemental compensation plans the yearoveryear and sequential declines relating to the supplemental compensation plan resulted in a related decrease in staff related expense within the other operating expense line net interest income which ill discuss in more detail later was million in the first quarter down both yearoveryear and sequentially lets look at the components of our trust investment fees on page for our corporate institutional services business fees totaled million in the first quarter and were up yearoveryear and up on a sequential basis custody and fund administration fees the largest component of cis fees were million and up yearoveryear and down sequentially the yearoveryear performance was driven by favorable markets and new business partially offset by unfavorable currency translation the sequential decline was primarily driven by unfavorable currency translation partially offset by favorable markets and new business assets under custodyadministration for cis clients were trillion at quarter end flat yearoveryear and down sequentially the yearoveryear performance reflected new business offset by lower market levels and unfavorable currency translation the sequential performance is driven by lower market levels and unfavorable currency translation partially offset by new business recall that lagged market values factor into the northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 quarters fees with both quarter lag and month lag markets impacting our cis custody and fund administration fees investment management fees in cis of million in the first quarter were up yearoveryear and up sequentially both the yearoveryear and sequential performance was driven by favorable markets and new business assets under administration for cis clients were billion down yearoveryear and down sequentially both the year both the prior year and sequential comparisons were impacted by lower markets and favorable currency translation partially offset by new business flows the sequential decline was primarily driven by markets partially offset by new business and an increase in prior in periodend securities lending in period end securities lending collateral levels similar to custody and fund administration fees note that lagged market values factor into cis investment management fees securities lending fees were million in the first quarter up yearoveryear and up sequentially the yearoveryear increase was primarily driven by higher volumes while sequential increase was primarily driven by higher spreads and volumes securities lending collateral was billion at quarter end and averaged billion across the quarter average collateral levels increased yearoveryear and sequentially moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were million in the first quarter were up compared to the prior quarter and up sequentially the yearoveryear increase was driven by favorable markets and new business while favorable markets were also the driver of the sequential growth both month lag and quarter lag asset levels impact wealth management fees assets under management were billion quarter end down yearoveryear and down sequentially the decreases were primarily driven by unfavorable markets partially offset by new business flows moving to page net interest income was million in the first quarter and down from the prior year earning assets averaged billion in the quarter flat versus the prior year average deposits were billion and were up versus the prior year the net interest margin was in the first quarter and was down point basis points from a year ago the net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower shortterm interest rates primarily offset by a balance sheet mix shift on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was also down average earning assets increased on a sequential basis while the net interest margin declined basis points looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the first quarter us dollar deposits represented of our total average deposits this was flat to a year ago and up slightly from in the prior quarter turning to page expenses were billion in the first quarter and were higher than the prior year and lower than the prior quarter compensation expense totaled million and was up compared to one year ago and up sequentially last years compensation expense included million relating to severance related charges excluding these charges the yearoveryear growth was mainly driven by higher salary expense driven by staff growth and base pay adjustments as well as an accrual for supplemental payment to certain employees in response to the covid19 pandemic the sequential increase was primarily due to higher expenses related to longterm performancebased incentive compensation due to divesting provisions associated with grants to retirement eligible employees in the current quarter as well as the previously mentioned supplemental payment partially offset by lower cashbased incentive cost the quarters compensation included million in expense associated with the retirement of eligible staff compared to million in the prior year employee benefit expense of million was up from oneyear ago and sequentially both increases were driven by higher retirement plan expenses and payroll taxes the northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 sequential growth was partially offset by lower medical costs outside services of million were up on a yearoveryear basis and down sequentially the yearoveryear growth was primarily driven by increased thirdparty advisory fees and technical service costs the sequential decrease was due to lower consulting legal and technical services equipment and software expense of million was up from a year ago and down sequentially the yearoveryear growth was reflected by higher depreciation reflected higher depreciation and amortization and software support costs sequentially the decrease was driven by lower software disposition charges partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization occupancy expense of million decreased from a year ago and was down sequentially the sequential decline was primarily due to the renegotiated renegotiation of a lease resulting in a million reduction of a related asset retirement obligation other operating expense of million was down from a year ago and down sequentially the yearoveryear decrease was primarily driven by lower staff related expense partially offset by increased contribution to the northern trust charitable foundation sequentially the decrease was primarily driven by lower staff related and business promotion expenses partially offset by increased contributions to the charitable foundation the lower staff related costs were related to a decline in supplemental compensation plan expenses and resulted in a related decline in other operating income as weve discussed on previous calls through our value for spend initiative which we started in weve been realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing million in annualized expense run rate savings with our results this quarter we surpassed that goal while weve exceeded our goal of million our efforts around our value for spend and overall productivity will broadly not cease and we further embed a culture of sustainable expense management across the company and turning to page our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity tier ratio of under the standardized approach and under the advanced approach our tier leverage ratio was under both the standardized and advanced approaches in the first quarter as previously announced the proceeds from the issuance of series e preferred stock were used to redeem all outstanding shares of series c preferred stock deferred issuance cost of million were recognized upon redemption which were included in our first quarter results under preferred dividend line in arriving at net income allocated to common shareholders during the first quarter of the series e preferred stock dividend was approximately million covering the period from november through march the ongoing series e dividend will be approximately million per quarter with the series e dividends still occurring semiannually in the first and third quarters of each year also during the first quarter we declared cash dividends totaling million to common stockholders on march we announced temporary suspension of repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program consistent with broader industry efforts to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic by maintaining strong capital levels and liquidity in the us financial system prior to the suspension we repurchased million shares of common stock at a cost of million let me take a make a few comments summarizing the quarter as well as comment on some of the headwinds that were facing as we move through the remainder of despite the impact of a mixed global macroeconomic environment we performed well during the quarter generating a pretax margin of and a return on average common equity of our performance reflects the momentum we carried into and we were able to generate positive fee operating leverage and positive total operating leverage on a yearover northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 year basis our balanced business model continued to generate organic growth with each of our clientfacing reporting segments of wealth management and cis contributing approximately of our earnings looking ahead to the remainder of the year the macroeconomic environments going to certainly create headwinds for certain revenue lines first as it create as it relates to lower expenses we will of course see pressure on our net interest margin and net interest income as we move forward through the year were currently anticipating that second quarter net interest income will decline to on a sequential basis next as ive mentioned in my comments throughout the presentation its important to remember that lagged markets impact the calculation of our trust fees while month lag and quarter lag equity markets were mainly favorable for first quarter well see an impact on our fees going forward one indication of this is our periodend assets under custodyadministration and assets under management declining sequentially by and respectively as a reminder approximately threequarters of our fees are sensitive to asset levels finally the newly adopted accounting standard for credit losses makes our reserves for credit losses sensitive to changes in the macroeconomic environment if economic conditions continue to worsen over the course of the year we can expect to recognize additional provisions we cannot ignore the macro headwinds pressuring our revenues as we move forward into we remain laser focused on managing our expense base and driving further productivity improvement its times like these that show the importance of a strong capital base and liquidity profile to support our clients activities and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise theyve come to expect thank you again for participating in northern trusts first quarter earnings conference call today mike mark lauren and i are happy to answer any of your questions katie will you please open the line northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 question and answer section operator thank you sir operator instructions thank you our first question will come from alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody thanks for taking the question so i wanted to start with your guys thoughts around the organic fee growth in the current environment so i think in the past you talked about low to mid singledigit growth across institutional and wealth businesses so wondering how the current sales cycle likely being extended how is that impacting the fee growth outlook from an organic basis and as a kind of followup to that obviously importantly want to get your thoughts on expenses while again similarly you talked about aligning expense growth with organic fee growth again sort of i call it to range how low can you guys take that given the current environment and any thoughts around expense growth would be helpful thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure good morning alex let me start on the first dynamic of organic growth it was a strong organic growth period and i think both yearoveryear and then sequentially it was nice to see we had organic growth both in the cis business and used it at a high level with a little over of pure net new business that contributed to the growth in cis and then we also had overall positive growth in the from an organic perspective in the wealth management side of the business and you dont see it but the asset management business on its own also provided some positive organic growth which is nice to see a lot of it was driven by very strong movement into cash was looking at over the weekend i think there was over billion in flows overall into that category and our nif treasury fund is number one in its peer group in investment performance and just that those that set of funds alone has aum of over billion right now so in a lot of ways things are going well i think its also important just to take a second to think about some of the interactions weve had with our business and this i think feeds into your question about how we should think about this in the longer term and just take wealth management for example i was talking to some of the leaders there and just some interesting notes one their call report volume just activity with clients has really skyrocketed i think over increase in call reports just from our central region just gives a sense of the activity there we do these webinars to teach clients about and talk more from our experts about whats going on we typically get about or people show up for those virtually and theyre at record levels now is over people consistently coming into that and then even the marketing material we track things as granularly as the page views that we get from the marketing material we send out that averages about page views and over the last several weeks weve been averaging to and so i think in the short run it was interesting to see that we were able to actually close good pieces of new business that was already in the pipeline i think the very longterm bodes very well for us given some of the statistics i just threw out the engagement weve had with clients i think if theres an area of caution its going to be in that midterm pipeline i think theres just not as few clients that are going to be spinning up new opportunities whether its on the cis side they feel the same way or the wealth side so i think were going to close all the business that we can that was already in kind of the one not funded late in the pipeline and i think the longterm looks very good and we can talk about the more countercyclical dynamics of outsourcing that lead in to help on the new business side for cis but the longterm feels good i think the short term we obviously have to be cautious about northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 and then on expenses ill start but maybe mike or mark will join in as we think about that we want to bucket it in a few different categories and probably the best way to think about it might even be just to look through if you go to page of the of the earnings release that outlines expenses pretty well and in more detail and first of all we had a long list of different paths we could take on this from just saying let expenses play through to lets go ahead and do a full replan of expenses and we took the latter approach we took a very aggressive detailed approach to unwrapping our expenses based on what we knew the environment was going to look like in the short run at least and so we unbucketed things the way we traditionally do inflation productivity business growth and investments and weve been very aggressive at outlining where we can address expenses now if you look at page the areas that are more related to client activity or markets have to do with outside services and equipment and software and super high level roughly you get kind of to of those have that that type that have some correlation to markets and new business those are the areas weve been laser focused on but even on it investment were just rerationalizing everything that weve committed to do michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah this is mike i would just add to what jason said that there are near term actions that weve already taken and continue can continue to take which definitely looks to bring down the expense run rate from where we were in the fourth quarter and then where we are now and then just given that the world has changed and will change there are new opportunities for productivity over the longterm i mean if you think about real estate costs and other costs that come with having everybody in facilities versus now as i mentioned earlier were roughly people working from home its not going to stay at that level but i also dont think the operating model will be the same once we get through this alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great great thats helpful and i dont want to put words in your guys mouth to maybe just to clarify i guess in the past you talked about expense growth aligning with organic fee growth and in the near term organic fee growth sounds like its obviously going to moderate pretty considerably so should we think about the total expense business expense base being flattish yearoveryear or is there a way to bring that down just hoping to get some more granularity michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so youre correct in characterizing the way that we have talked about the organic expense growth rate for expenses aligning with the fee growth and so yes as that comes down the fee growth comes down the organic expense growth rate comes down as well and then beyond that as youre saying alex yes were also saying outside of the organic part just looking at total expenses were trying to bring those down and i wouldnt put a specific stake in the ground as to whether thats flat or up or down because again some of those expenses are affected by the environment but thats what were trying to drive to so it is as jason said its a replan theres no part of it that says were just plowing through with the same plan that we had at the beginning of the year operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 hi thanks very much wonder if i could ask the question i could use them both on this on the provision and the loan book so if you could talk generically what type of economic backdrop you wrote that provision to because the world was changing a lot right around quarter end and then if we could talk about the loan book that produced most of that im assuming its almost all in ci and cre so maybe you could talk about what in say office retail and construction where that is derived from how much of it is clients that are across the firm versus some things that are syndicated i really appreciate we normally dont have much discussion about your loan book thanks michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure glenn well let me just start with some of the assumptions that went into the forecast i think like a lot of firms we the sec is very specific in saying youve got to pick a use your end of period date use your forecast at that point to drive your increase or decrease in reserves and so we obviously followed that if you look at right at the end of the period we were looking at unemployment of we had a peak to trough change in gdp of just over and then as you likely know thats not it its not like we have those assumptions and then it spits out the million provision number we have a variety dozens of factors that go from there and from the number of forecasts that we use the weights and the priorities of those forecasts the downgrade assumptions of the underlying credits which drive the expected loss assumptions and so you go through a very rigorous governance process to take the output of the forecast and the model to drive to a final number for provision after we did that like all other financial firms we went through a new forecasting period the economic inputs in the market were changing dramatically we were watching that closely so within the next couple weeks we went through a forecast that went to an unemployment peak of and a peak to trough gdp change of and so that gives an indication that directionally the provision number if we were to go through that same governance process would have yielded a higher provision number at that point now that said we didnt go through that same finalization of the governance process after that second forecast was wrong we could do that every day its a very rigorous process but we followed the letter of what the sec and what the accounting guidelines provide us to do and so we will continue to do those updates as we always do with our forecasting process and well have that rigorous process added to it as we get into the next reporting period and then if we want to touch on the loan book itself why dont we go through some headlines and ill start and then maybe mark can jump in i think that the key is its theres no dramatic difference between what weve told you before about the loan portfolio and what it is today there is a lot of other even qualitative assumptions that go into that the number that drives the cecl accounting provision number but why dont we provide a little bit more information so mark ill turn it over to you for that mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah looking at the entire loan portfolio over of the loans to a private client is secured by marketable securities primarily and those are primarily indiscernible northern trust you do have about of the portfolio which is residential real estate again the nature of those indiscernible is somewhat unique i mean for example over of those would have fico scores of or higher when you start to look at the commercial and the commercial real estate the commercial is predominantly investment grade and on the commercial real estate side the lending is to investors as opposed to developers and over of those commercial real estate loans have personal guarantees as well so pretty high quality when we look at the ci portfolio as far as where the high impact or low impacts might be from the current situation that we find ourselves in we would say were very much predominantly in what we would hope is in the lower impact when we look at the kind of industry segmentation there northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi so just one tiny clarification the gdp numbers that you mentioned is that full year or second quarter michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp no no thats for the full year thats that would be the peak to trough change for the full year so at a high level the assumption that we used had very sharp second quarter decline and then a relatively strong recovery but not to the current levels of gdp operator thank you our next question comes from mike carrier with bank of america michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning and thanks for taking the questions first can you provide a bit more color on the net interest income outlook particularly given the rise in deposits and expectations in this backdrop with a lot of liquidity out there coming into the nim just how youre thinking about the portfolio and reinvestment rates michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure thanks mike ill start well first of all the more time we spend around nii i think what jumps out to me is that the key is actually less the size of the balance sheet which is driven so much by the deposit growth it has much more to do with whats happening with loan volume and if you think about it the size of the balance sheet and the size of average earning assets is going to be dominated by client deposits coming on and in a different interest rate environment thats going to have an impact on nii but in the short run you think about it and on an incremental basis were not investing those deposits long and were not investing them with credit risk either and so the dynamic there is that effectively youre bringing the size is driven by deposits that are going to be reinvested a lot in ioer basis points and maybe something somewhat different than that but not dramatically the things that are going to drive nii more are going to be really two things one the volume of loans and then secondly weve talked about this before but the spread of onemonth libor to the bottom end of the fed funds or ioer very important it really gives you a sense of of the nii impact of the a lot of the earning assets and how those are going to behave and contribute to nii and so those are really the big factors and so yeah i mentioned that because i think its just important to decouple and not try and predict nii based on where that in nim is going to go i think you have to have more of a bottomsup approach of thinking about particularly loans and then what is libor going to do libor has been coming down a couple basis points a day effectively and where you think that the trajectory there is going to go is a very important factor michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay thats helpful and then just had a quick followup can you help us just in how we should be thinking about fee waivers ph ahead in a zero rate backdrop michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 yeah we a lot of the information out there will help track that a little bit but as we sit today none of the large funds are in a position where their yields are below their fee rates and if we look out on that a little bit we you guys can see as much as we can without a real contrarian approach you dont see that changing at least in the next several weeks or so now that said i mentioned early in the opening that our nif treasury fund at billion to billion you get if at to basis points in fees if we fall below those rates by even basis points youre talking about annual run rate just from a math perspective of potentially million and were not there yet but if we were to try and point you to something to track in between the time that were able to talk publicly those would be the line items to look at operator thank you our next question comes from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks very much for taking the questions maybe just staying with the balance sheet for a minute on that libor to ioer spread i guess down the to down is that considering current libor onemonth libor rates or that or are you factoring in libor to compress further with that and if you could just remind us again on the loan repricing mechanism i think its three quarters of loans repriced quarterly to onemonth libor with the rest lagged for one year if you could just remind us on that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so just to start with the end its actually i think its a little higher than that its about of the loan book is actually floating at this point and thats tied very mostly to libor and then to what our assumptions are the down to number we provided is reflective of a tightening of the spread between libor and ioer and so weve looked at that and continue to think that thats going to compress a decent amount on a spot basis i havent looked at it this morning but last week it was kind of that libor at kind of basis points against an ioer of and we think that could continue to narrow a fair amount if you think about where libor was just a couple weeks ago its significantly higher than that and so we certainly feel like thats got to be part of any projection brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay and deposit levels april versus the period end in the to guidance michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp down youll see the last page of the press release even just where the balance sheet ended at billion or so and again thats all thats the size of the balance sheet is completely driven by the size of client deposits and there was significant increase throughout the quarter and frankly there were increases significant increases and we ended not at where it peaked and so we the balance sheet has had very strong growth in clients its all about client activity thats clients derisked and came out of larger equity positions or other fixed income positions they wanted balance sheets that they were comfortable with and they were comfortable with ours and we wanted to be there for them and since then weve had deposit levels come down significantly from those peaks and ph probably theyve been more on kind of the to range range and in that type of in that type of area over the beginning of the second quarter but and thats still elevated relative to what where we experienced historically and at peaks or at the end of the first quarter northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 operator thank you our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning on the balance sheet jason can you talk through where the floating ph six mix is of the balance sheet right now what the duration of the portfolio is and just how do you decide based on your prior response about the ins and outs of deposits where youre going with reinvestment yield so much lower in terms of the asset side of earning assets distribution thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes thank you ken and yeah weve we are reinvesting short is the quick answer to the question and we want to we dont feel that theres potential that the potential need from clients to have very spiky aggressive needs and desires to be on the balance sheet is necessarily over and so we want to make sure weve got plenty of dry powder and plenty of capacity for them on both the loans and deposits side and so were taking the short term approach of being there for our clients our duration i think at the beginning of last year of probably was around we had stepped that out we told the investment community we were going to step it out wed gotten all the way out to about and since then very recently as were reinvesting maturing securities thatll come in a little bit as we position the portfolio to maintain maximum capacity over thats not reflective of a long term strategy but it is reflective of our desire to be there for clients in the short run ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and the fixedfloating mix do you have that available jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah mark mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah the split between the shorter securities book and the longer weve its been running closer to historically i think more recently the longer book was a little larger jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp and then as jason said as we reinvest depending on where those reinvestments go that could shift a little bit but and balance a little bit tilted towards the longer side of where it was on average during the quarter jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 yeah mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp and the funding side we think of as more and we try and stay matched on that reflectively on the reinvestment side i think as we continue to go shorter in the near term thats going to lean a little bit more short but in the long run its about kind of maintaining that maintaining the hedge operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just my question was answered but just one followup you said of people are working from home can you elaborate more on what sort of more permanent business model change that might lead to michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah mike this is mike in the way that we thought about the operating model over time its never been one that we thought in a stabilized way that we would be at working outside of facilities frankly what weve learned through this crisis is that we can meet client needs and be able to operate the business execute the business even at that high level of remote working having said that this is not the level that we want to sustain well have to be careful as we have people return to the office that will happen in a phased approach but frankly longer term as i mentioned i think that there are opportunities because if even went beyond just the ability to serve our clients and think about efficiency we may have lost some efficiency during this time period but frankly its also i would say demonstrated that there are inefficiencies in having everybody come in and out of the facilities around the globe and that there is certain work that is easier to have our partners our employees do remotely or even if its not completely remotely do they come into a facility for a portion of the week things like that and that also aligns with some of the things weve been doing over time about our workspaces its as you would expect its not all about everybody having an office or even a cubicle its more about open spaces and flexible workspaces and things like that and that fits in with not having everybody reporting into the office at the same time so we dont have the complete longterm operating model at this point but again i dont believe itll go back to the way it was and i think frankly itll present opportunities for both greater efficiency and i think for our employees additional satisfaction on their overall work life mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and as it relates to customers i mean you see schools going online youre seeing zoom meetings youre seeing telemedicine on the other hand your customers are at the very high end and they probably want facetoface service but whats your flexibility there michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah without a doubt and as you point out we have a high engagement model in wealth management and yet if you if someone thought it was all about the facilities then we would have been going the opposite direction for the last several years right in the sense of we actually have fewer offices now for wealth management than we northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 did years ago years ago and thats because that engagement at the higher level often happens at the clients office at the clients home and also through technology through using videoconferencing and just the ability for clients to interact directly with their account online on their phone et cetera so its a multifaceted engagement model and one that again we think we can differentiate ourselves in this jason talked about some of the calling statistics if you talk to our partners in wealth management as we said theyve been more engaged over this time period than the three months lets say prior to it a lot of that because of all the activity but also theyve used different ways to do it so we look forward to when we can meet more with clients but that doesnt necessarily mean it has to happen in an office operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so you noted earlier in a question relating to credit that you have lower exposure to the higher risk industry categories given some of the stress in energy markets i was hoping you could speak to any direct exposure to the energy sector maybe what specific energy categories in particular such as ep midstream et cetera michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so at a high level the exposure to energy is very very low and a lot of our weve got a lot of clients that had garnered their wealth from the industry but our lending exposure specifically to oil and gas is very very low steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay and just one followup from me jason you gave lots of detail on deposits just given the significant growth the bulk of thats being deployed into ioer if i look at the balance sheet during the prior three qe cycles now you had a lot of qe driven deposit growth a lot of those deposits actually stayed on the balance sheet and your approach was pretty balanced in terms of how much was deployed into securities versus ioer im just wondering why would things play out differently this time and maybe just how youre thinking about the mix where for every incremental deposit how much of that should we assume goes into ioer or versus securities that admittedly youre going to be short dated to ensure that you have greater flexibility from a liquidity standpoint jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp frankly this is about trying to ensure were there for clients in the long run and we could make short term calls saying lets extend a little bit and even if we missed the yield curve a little we dont have stories from our clients where we werent there for them we have been able to do a lot weve got ample room from a tier leverage perspective from liquidity perspectives and but we talk all the time about our balance sheet being there for clients and so we want to live up to that and not fall to temptation of trying to use the deposits and go very long now youre absolutely right that there is an element of these deposits thats going to stick around a while and that will enable us particularly the wealth deposits are very valuable once those season and are here it enables us to extend more and invest those more whether its in loans or nonhigh quality liquid assets and that creates a lot of value for us we just want to be patient and make sure that we dont do that too early but some of the growth that weve had on the deposit side over the last year or even not just the last month and a half but over the last year it reflects a higher base level of deposits and a lot of it on the wealth side which is very very valuable northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 operator thank you our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking the question first question is a followup on the expenses so you talked about some of the actions taken you helped us understand the pieces that were subject to volumes and when i take a look at the midpoint of that i think you said it was outside services and equipment and software to so if you take the midpoint thats about your annual expenses does that mean that things outside of that bucket of expenses youre going to be able to calibrate and the that we should grow maybe at an elevated rate given some of the things that are going on can you help us think about what at least logically might come into play when we try to calibrate how to forecast your expense growth for the year jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah sure so if we come back to that framework that page ill give you a little bit more of how i think about the subcategories in there so outside services and some the headlines some of these things are going to be mixed some will be able to moderate lower and some are going to have more activity as weve invested to make sure that weve got good operational resiliency and so within outside services for example a lot of that is consulting and legal costs well on the consulting side there are going to be projects that we had planned to do we went through our original planning process that dont necessarily chin the bar at this point or that were just going to delay for a period of time or that were going to do with a reduced scope and so those are the types of conversations we have there on legal we actually hinted very quickly i think in the script that weve had some benefit some things go our way on some legal matters and so thats part of the benefit that weve had in there if you think about equipment and software thats an interesting line item because even within there there are items that will go both ways weve also invested more heavily in infrastructure there but at the same time thats where there is some capital it projects that we might not do and then theres also an overlay on both of these where we have to think about whats related to the core business either from an assets perspective or just client activity things like market data thirdparty advisory fee subcustody brokerage clearing those are the some of those line items that will add up to that kind of roughly to number that were thinking about and then in occupancy just to refresh your memory on some of the things weve talked about we had already been in late stages of some of some larger transitions and investments and we talked about the fact that in the short run we might have some overlap in rent and investment and we think thats going to peak around second quarter and then we should get the benefit of that more in the second half of the year brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay that helps thank you and when we think about i think you mentioned the legal benefits that youve been receiving in some of these lines could you help us maybe calibrate how much that helped if we should think about any of that i would think legal benefits are somewhat episodic but is that the right way to think about it or is that some is there some sustainability to those benefits any noise calibration would also be helpful thanks northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah brennan this is mark i mean i would start with the outside services category you do get consulting and legal as two expenses that i would say will fluctuate based on engagements so and when you look at in general how much they makeup of the category its actually a fairly small percentage its just that they can be volatile from quartertoquarter so they might makeup to of the expenses thats even ph out of the category but they do based on timing of engagements theyll go favorable or they might popup in a given quarter i would say this quarter was one where the engagements were lower and there was some ph asset in the expense that we realized but i dont know that i would necessarily portray it as a trend but contractor expenses and things like that they go into things like consulting certainly thats something that can be an area that we can focus on managing operator thank you our next question comes from brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for taking my questions i hear what youre saying about the nii being down in the second quarter but how do you think about it then after the second quarter is there a period of time that the liabilities will catch up on the repricing side and kind of how we think about deposit betas moving forward michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp well i think that in there are two competing factors there one is our desire in the short run to make sure that were maximizing loan capacity effectively for our clients i think but in the longer run this base of business this base of deposits thats more core well be able to invest in a better way the counter to that is that the duration that we built in the portfolio will start to dissipate and so the more were reinvesting of the portfolio that we had coming into this year the more were going to experience the impact of lower nominal rates and even so even if we were taking longer duration into even if were extending the portfolio from a reinvestment perspective well be doing so with in a lower interest rate environment and so that those competing factors will operate and i think its up to everybody to have their own determinations of what they think the interest rate environments going to look like in the intermediate term brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then just a second question on the custody and fund admin fees is there any way to tease out what the pickup in activity meant for fees in the quarter like comparing fourth quarter to first quarter i know some clients are price based on activity levels thanks mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah brian its mark so i would say that when you look at the sequential performance for custody and fund services there was a there was some market benefit again there is month lag and quarter lag fees there are more month lag than quarter lag and actually the eafe local was slightly negative on a month lag sequential basis so there was a little bit of market pickup but there was also to jasons point earlier about the sequential kind of organic 1ish percent organic growth we usually look at organic on yearoveryear but sequentially thats probably in the right range a little more than that there was a drag from currency so thats kind of those northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 are the largest factors theres also some other nonasset level fees that were a little bit down sequentially on things like account level fees and things like that but so overall kind of balanced out to flattish i would say operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for taking my followup just wanted to just go over that the pricing on the custody business and the wealth management business i know the mix has changed over time because youve been servicing more people in the administrative basis particularly in alternatives and thats created a little bit more of an averaging mix than it used to be historically but if you could just review within the cis asset servicing business what portion of that book is priced on a quarterend lag versus more of an averaging basis and then just staying within wealth management a portion of that is priced on that one month lag i think the custody part that that you dont manage in wealth management i think thats on a prior quarter lag if im not mistaken maybe if youre able to just review that price difference mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah yeah brian this is mark so yeah its pretty similar to what weve said before so with custody and fund administration first and this is in cis there is about to call it of fees that are not asset value sensitive so thats the first part of the fees that are asset value sensitive so the remaining about three quarters of those are month lag and a quarter of them are quarter lag which is similar to what weve what we would have updated a year ago i think last time we had a change in markets when we gave that update and then remember as far as the asset sensitive its not all equity exposure because we have an allocation across multiple asset classes when you get to the wealth management side i would probably divide it between the regions and the global family office the global family office business youre right there is a that is probably more leaned towards the quarter lag its similar to the asset servicing business in cis and theres also about a quarter of those fees that arent asset sensitive more like what you see on the asset servicing side of cis and the regions and i would combine the regions together then youre looking at about three quarters or more of those fees being month lag so hopefully that gives you an idea not a significant change though from what weve said before there brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay yeah thats perfect and just i just missed the comment on the gdp assumption that you had in the for the credit provision if you could just reiterate that michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure so the baseline that we went with for the march for the reporting cycle had a peak to trough down a little over and then the update subsequent to that is its down operator thank you our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 hi good morning michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i had two questions one just on the comments that you made earlier in the call around the mediumterm caution in the pipeline could you just give us a sense as to the drivers of that and how long you think that what your view of medium term is and then maybe you could give us a sense as to this is really just a push out not an evaporation so maybe you could speak to how that comes back into your run rate as things open up michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure betsy its mike ill add on to what jason said earlier so if you think about the flow of new business theres business that weve won and its a matter of transitioning that business on and one of the things that again i want to give credit to our team on is the fact that even in the month of march with everything that happened we were able to transition the majority of the business that was scheduled to be transitioned so in that sense thats why we say right now that will look good having said that there are new mandates that were to transition in april for example or may or june that its not only that were in ill call it the work from home mode but that the clients are as well and so theyve said lets move our transition back further so theyre deferred transitions so when jason talked about in the medium term that would be new business that would come on for example in the second or the third quarter that now has been moved back and then if you then also think about whats happening with the client base certainly winning new clients is new business for us but its also the flow activity that they have whether thats an institutional client and what theyre doing with their funds are they more in a spending mode if you will utilizing mode if theyre a sovereign wealth fund thats been impacted by the environment or if theyre an asset manager are they part of the market that is a net gainer of flows or a net outflow and that of course then will impact us as well and then the last piece is just well what about new business activity where youre in the process of winning yes theres some slowdown in i would say mandate type decisions but also with a lot of activity like this we do see plenty of our clients that are saying weve been talking about outsourcing for some time period whether thats the whole middle office or thats trading you know what now that weve gone through this time period we can see that youre in a better position to do that for us than for us to do on our own so lets continue that dialogue and then we can figure out when well decide to do it and hopefully do it with us as well and so that happened thats why we say longer term we see a lot of opportunities but thats not going to impact the third or fourth quarter of this year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right so the medium term and the push out of the pipeline install is really a function of when you can get back into clients offices which is a little bit tbd but its a push out not an evaporation northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp correct betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then could you speak a little bit to how youre thinking about the buybacks i know that you stopped them but you obviously have a significant amount of capital just wondering how youre thinking about what the triggers will be for you to restart up michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp betsy its mike again so with regard to capital management and specifically share repurchases as you know theres been a tremendous amount of attention and rigor around capital management going back to the financial crisis so in that sense i would say we feel very good about the process around capital management and how we think about capital actions and the stress testing that we do et cetera and the reality is that now were in an actual stress and so it is an opportunity to be able to demonstrate that we can execute then on our capital actions the way that we thought of when we were going through various stress scenarios so being able to pull the lever on share repurchase like we did in say tremendous amount of uncertainty we can stop that very easily thats the benefit of share repurchases and weve said for the foreseeable future and thats just because the environment can change and there are many factors that go into it as you know but looking at our capital levels looking at the profitability levels the stress testing results with the fed all of that plays into the boards decision on how they think about capital action so just as it was easy i would say to pull the lever to stop share repurchases technically its very easy to push the lever the other direction its more just being able to assess the environment and the outlook at the time to be able to determine when thats appropriate operator thank you our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc id like to follow up on the credit comments northern trust is obviously very well regarded when it comes to credit you guys have done phenomenal job in the last years it was interesting in there was exposure to enron which surprised everybody that northern would have that kind of credit and what we discovered was as part of the employment benefits processing that you did for enron you were asked to join the revolver line what they did at the time are there any of those outside situations today that we just wouldnt expect northern to have a credit exposure im not asking for specific names but just to x y z companies like wow how did that happen is there any of that on the books today versus what it was in northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp well i appreciate the historical perspective on that going back to and i would say as far as the nature of how we think about credit its still very similar i mean its aligned with our overall business and with holistic relationships so that has not changed and specifically to clients where we are the custodian for their pension plan we often then are participating in their credit facilities now when you look at that portfolio companies it still goes through a very rigorous credit process and so its a very high quality set of companies as well as high quality set of credits theres no way that we can necessarily predict which sectors are going to be impacted by a particular stress scenario and so we wouldnt make the type of statement to say we have no exposures to any sectors that are troubled right now certainly we do but all of that we try to manage the size of the exposures for that and thats just youve just identified one area which is on the corporate side certainly we work with asset managers so were providing credit to the different types of asset managers and then on the wealth side the nature of where wealth is developed and so that can either be the companies that are owned by families but also the individual credit needs as mark mentioned about of our portfolio overall is basically margin lending its collateralized by their investment portfolio and so that would reflect the nature of that credit needs for that part of the client base gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thank you very much i appreciate it michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hey thanks for taking my followups just quick on fee waivers could you give us a breakdown of your money fund aum mix in between indiscernible michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp not sure i have it as handy why dont we mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp we can follow up with you i mean indiscernible mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp public on the northern funds northern institutional funds website but we could follow up with that brennan northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi thanks for accommodating the followup i just wanted to make sure its a quick modeling question the other income line there was a lot noise this quarter as we think about the right jumping off point for given with some of the boli tailwinds how should we be thinking about the appropriate run rate beginning in the second quarter michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure mark mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah even i can try to take that so it is a hard one because there is a lot that moves around within that category i guess one way that ive kind of talked about i think even on the last call we kind of talked about it certainly you have boli that has come in incrementally in each of the last four quarters with this quarter being about million so if you took boli out as well as some of the things that weve had like last quarter we had a lease loss of million if you adjust taking boli out of the last four quarters and adjust for the things weve called out and you kind of did the math youre probably looking at an average run rate of call it million million and then in theory you could then say okay well let me add the full run rate of boli in and add million to that so maybe that gets you to the million range i would just caution though it is a very there is volatility in that line so its a hard one theres things like currency hedging that flows through that line weve talked about some of the things that this quarter some of the marks might flow through that line the visa related incomeexpense type of swap marks flow through that line as well so it certainly does move around but if you looked at it over a longer period you could use that potentially as kind of an average run rate operator thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp great and really im going to save mark a followup call because i do have the aum breakout mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp okay michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp so cash aum at about billion at period end fixed income about billion and im going to lump index and active equity at about billion and then call the rest other and leave it there
