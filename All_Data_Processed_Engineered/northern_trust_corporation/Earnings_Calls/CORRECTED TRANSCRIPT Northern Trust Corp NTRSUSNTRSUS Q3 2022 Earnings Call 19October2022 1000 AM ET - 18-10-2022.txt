executive officer northern trust corp thank you jennifer let me join in welcoming everyone to our third quarter earnings call in the third quarter we continued to execute well through a challenging operating environment compared to the prior year revenue grew as the elimination of fee waivers and the favorable impact from higher interest rates more than offset the significant headwinds from weaker equity in fixed income markets asset outflows and unfavorable currency movements expense growth of reflected inflationary impacts across our cost base particularly within our compensation and equipment and software lines eps was flat and we generated a return on average common equity of new business activity in wealth management was encouraging and we continue to engage actively with new and existing clients northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 in asset management weak markets and institutional cash outflows reduced assets under management yet we saw continued growth in our alternatives taxadvantaged equity and etf complex and within asset servicing we continued to win new mandates and our backlog of new clients that havent yet been onboarded has expanded meaningfully and is expected to transition over the coming quarters in closing we remain wellpositioned to navigate the current macroeconomic and market uncertainty from a position of strength our new business pipeline remains robust and our capital position continues to be strong in a slowing growth environment weve also begun prudently tightening our expense controls and focusing on realizing productivity benefits from the investments weve made over the past several years ill now turn the call over to jason jason j tyler chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp thank you mike and let me join jennifer and mike in welcoming you to our third quarter earnings call lets dive into the financial results for the quarter starting on page this morning we reported third quarter net income of million earnings per share were and our return on average common equity was results for the quarter included a million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits expense category also recall that in the first quarter of this year we implemented an accounting reclassification of certain fees which will continue to impact yearoveryear comparisons as noted on this page lets move to page and review the financial highlights of the quarter yearoveryear revenue was up and expenses increased net income was flat in a sequential comparison revenue was down and expenses were up while net income was also flat return on average common equity was for the quarter up from a year ago and down from in the prior quarter lets look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page yearoveryear unfavorable currency translation impacted revenue growth by approximately basis points trust investment and other servicing fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled billion and were down from last year and down sequentially all other remaining noninterest income declined from the prior year and from the prior quarter net interest income which ill discuss in more detail later was million and was up from a year ago and sequentially lets look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page for our asset servicing business fees totaled million and were down yearoveryear and down sequentially within asset servicing custody and fund administration fees were million down yearoveryear and down sequentially custody and fund administration fees decreased sequentially primarily due to unfavorable markets unfavorable currency translation and lower transaction volumes custody and fund administration fees decreased from the prioryear quarter primarily due to unfavorable currency translation and unfavorable markets partially offset by new business assets under custody and administration for asset servicing clients were trillion at quarterend down yearoveryear and down sequentially both the yearoveryear and sequential declines were primarily driven by unfavorable markets and currency translation investment management fees within asset servicing were million up yearoveryear and down sequentially investment management fees decreased sequentially primarily due to unfavorable markets and northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 asset outflows investment management fees increased from the prioryear quarter primarily due to lower money market fund fee waivers and the accounting reclassification previously discussed partially offset by asset outflows and unfavorable markets assets under management for asset servicing clients were billion down yearoveryear and down sequentially both declines were driven by asset outflows weaker equity and fixed income markets and unfavorable currency translation moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were million down compared to the prior year and down from the prior quarter within the regions the yearoveryear declines were primarily driven by unfavorable market impacts partially offset by the elimination of money market fund fee waivers sequentially the decline within the regions was primarily driven by unfavorable markets within global family office the yearoveryear growth was driven by lower fee waivers and new business partially offset by unfavorable markets sequential decrease was mainly related to unfavorable markets assets under management for our wealth management clients were billion at quarterend its down yearover year and down on a sequential basis both the yearoveryear and sequential declines were driven primarily by unfavorable markets moving to page net interest income was million in the quarter and was up from the prior year earning assets averaged billion in the quarter down versus the prior year average deposits were billion and were down versus the prior year while loan balances averaged billion and were up compared to the prior year on a sequential quarter basis net interest income grew average earning assets declined average deposits declined while average loan balances were up the net interest margin was in the quarter up basis points from a year ago and up basis points from the prior quarter the prioryear quarter increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates and favorable balance sheet mix shift the sequential increase is primarily due to higher average interest rates turning to page expenses were billion in the quarter higher than the prior year and higher than the prior quarter on a yearoveryear basis expense growth benefited by approximately basis points due to currency translation the current quarters expenses included a million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits category this compares to similar charges in the prioryear quarter of million and million in the priorperiod quarter also included in the current quarter is the impact of the previously mentioned accounting reclassification which increased other operating expense by million compared to the prior year compensation expense was up compared to the prior year and up sequentially the yearoveryear growth was primarily driven by higher salary expense in part due to inflationary pressures partially offset by favorable currency translation the sequential increase is primarily due to higher salary expense partially offset by lower incentives and favorable currency translation outside services expense was million and was up from a year ago and up sequentially the year overyear increase is primarily driven by higher consulting and technical service costs partially offset by lower thirdparty advisory fees the sequential increase is primarily due to higher technical services and consulting costs equipment and software expense of million was up from one year ago and up sequentially the yearoveryear growth was primarily driven by higher software costs due to continued investments in northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 technology as well as inflationary pressures and higher amortization the sequential increase is primarily due to higher software amortization expense occupancy expense at million was down from a year ago and up sequentially the other operating expense of million was up from one year ago and down sequentially the sequential decline is primarily due to lower miscellaneous expenses in the current period turning to page our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity tier ratio of under the standardized approach down from the prior quarters our tier leverage ratio is up from in the prior quarter an increase in net unrealized losses on the available for sale securities portfolio was a primary factor in this quarters change in capital ratios accumulated other comprehensive income at the end of the current quarter was a loss of billion with the loss from the third quarter totaling approximately million as previously announced in the third quarter we increased the quarterly common stock dividend by or a share to per share during the quarter we returned million to common shareholders through cash dividends of million and share repurchases of million the current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquid balance sheet to both weather the uncertain economic conditions and to support our clients needs we approach the end of the year on solid footing and remain wellpositioned to serve our clients and communities while generating longterm value to our shareholders and with that victor please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi how are you doing jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp doing well northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i did want to just dig in a little bit on the expense side and when i listen and look at the results theres some areas where it feels like maybe the inflation is impacting a little bit i know youre being very disciplined in how youre investing but i just wanted to make sure i understand how youre thinking about managing the expense base as we go through this inflationary environment and is there an opportunity to pull back on some of the consulting side professional services side or should we anticipate that the kind of rate change were seeing in this quarter should persist thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure well let me start with a direct answer to the question and yes there are things we can do and weve been focused on to address expense growth and so let me predominantly even within this period in mid september we announced internally some additional expense controls we always have those in place but we meaningfully ramped up expense controls particularly around hiring thats obviously the largest component of where we see expense increases thats our largest line and so that will lead us to have just a higher bar on where we have increases in expenses particularly from a hiring perspective thats not to say that we are going to stop investing in the things indiscernible that were not going to continue investing in the things around technology and other areas where we know weve had important investments to take place but at the same time we do see an opportunity for us to raise that bar to try and tamp down the growth that weve seen in expenses betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just separately as im thinking through the growth profile here youve got some nice exposure to international at the same time weve got the strong dollar weighing on the results to a certain extent maybe you could help us think through the impact of the dollar and if we excluded that how results would have looked this quarter thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure well at a super high level the company has a very natural hedge from a currency perspective and so this quarter it was very roughly call it basis points in impact from both the revenue side and the expense side and so the dollar does play in but it plays on both the revenue and the expense side the other impact thats not as symmetrical is how the dollar plays is how currency plays in more from an asset level perspective that played into asset level movements in both assets under custody as well as assets under management and something people wont typically think about it even played in on the deposit decline and when you think about the movement weve had and we can talk about that in more detail but even the deposits had a downward move in value of about billion in aggregate across all currencies betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it thanks northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator thank you and one moment for next question and our next question will come from the line of alexander blostein from goldman sachs your line is jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc oh hey guys good morning sorry i didnt catch my name there so a couple of questions i guess one obviously deposit outflows sounds like picked up in september relative to sort of the last update that we heard from you guys at the barclays conference i think you said around billion came in a little bit lower but the mix in particular i think was a little bit more pronounced too with noninterestbearing declining substantially so maybe just an update on sort of how the quarters progressed but also more importantly where the deposits stand today and the mix noninterestbearing and interestbearing as well as any of your sort of updated thoughts on where the deposit levels could ultimately trough out it looks like the noninterestbearing piece is getting pretty close to the kind of precovid levels but curious to get your thoughts there jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so first of all on the deposit levels and where they were relative to our expectation actually came in really close particularly given what we mentioned earlier in that the currency effect of the nonusd and so where they landed at the quarter where they averaged actually was pretty close and i mentioned that because as we get to the next quarter i think we are its very difficult to predict in general and so but let me hit mix first so youre right noninterestbearing dropped significantly during the quarter and thats something we expect to happen a lot of our financial services clients that use our balance sheet are often in noninterestbearing accounts but as rates rise off of zero they have the opportunity to move into interest bearing accounts and they did that a lot of the a very high percentage of the accounts that are eligible to do that have done so at this point which gets exactly to your point alex that were kind of at in some ways those precovid levels thats not to say we wont see additional movements there but we think certainly a lot of it has already taken place and then the third part of your question of where do we see things today just looking at the first two weeks of the quarter deposits behaved about what we would anticipate they tend to come down a little bit at this point into the quarter and so were in that kind of billion to billion what we expect to happen between now and the end of the quarter is an interesting dynamic theres two forces working against each other one is with quantitative tightening and the yield curve being higher and clients across the board continuing to look at how they can allocate nonoperational but more investment cash that continues to put a downward pressure northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 but in the short run theres an offset to that theres an upward pressure in the seasonality that weve seen in fourth quarter which tends to have more of an upward pressure and so its difficult to see which one of those is going to have stronger influences but best guess is you might call it flat from here and so that billion billion level but appreciating that theres big forces moving against each other alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for that appreciate the color and i guess speaking of institutions looking to earn a little bit extra yield on their cash when i look at northerns securities portfolio you guys are yielding i think about and the market rates there are probably closer to maybe a little higher now geographically it could be different with the mix but obviously an attractive opportunity to reprice there i guess with aoci losses already running through your capital any appetite to sell down i guess some of the loweryielding securities without necessarily changing the profile of fixed versus floating and kind of keeping the overall duration of the portfolio in a similar place but i guess crystallizing some of the losses but picking up incremental ph nii in the current environment jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah so we talk about it a lot and i think an important dynamic for everyone to know and i know you appreciate this is that the economics of taking the loss reinvesting that lower amount at the higher yield the efficiency of markets are just telling you that over time the impact of that should be relatively equal now the second component though is that there may be other reasons to do that you might be looking to you might have a view that the yield curve is going to change significantly you might want to handle other ratios by doing that and so its not to say that we wouldnt do it but its just to say that the quick trade of take the realize the loss invest at a higher rate its not as easy and its not as beneficial we care about just the longterm value of what the securities portfolio is yielding not just the nii or nim in the short run alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc right fair enough thanks guys jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you bet thanks alex operator thank you one moment for next question our next question comes line of mike mayo from wells fargo your line is open jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp hello mike northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc indiscernible jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp were getting a lot of static in the background and i want to make sure that i want to make sure we answer your question right do you want to anyway you can find indiscernible mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc is that any better michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp dramatically jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good go for it mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so much for my ipad so look are the tailwinds done jason you correctly predicted the nim going back to the levels of elimination of fee waivers those are good on the other hand i guess you still have some tailwinds from the uninstalled business which really isnt clear why thats so much higher were there delays or are you just winning business on the other hand you have the headwinds from the lower stock markets is that going to continue or is that mostly in the numbers now so if you can help me with the tailwinds and the headwind question and the reason i ask that is because you got those tailwinds and you still had negative operating leverage so its are you just a hostage to your business model or can you have revenues grow faster than expenses jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah yeah so a couple of things in there let me try to hit them but certainly ask me to clarify if i dont get all of them one on rates is it done the answer is no we still have upward movement and in fact we looked just northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 within the quarter at the month and september was just a tiny bit above and so we got into that level and even at this point betas will be much higher but wont be and so well get an incremental lift and then the third dynamic of that is that as the securities portfolio is repricing just alexs question earlier it takes time but we have an opportunity to reinvest at these higher rates so not done yet second on the pipeline of business that has taken longer to come in some of the opportunities we have in asset servicing in particular in the wonnotonboarded category are very big and theyre chunky and those just take longer and the volatility in the markets we think has just made clients just want to make sure that everything is lined up properly and so that wonnotonboarded category is significantly higher than it is on average but were confident about it coming through and then the stock market dynamic youre right usually we talk about operating leverage and the numbers are just much smaller its can we get the expense growth plus a little bit of market lift to match and but in this environment the macro environment is just dominating whats happening to both expense growth and revenue growth and so ive been saying all year we cannot there are false positives in the operating leverage there are false negatives in the fee operating leverage and this is a year where we have to just understand that those numbers are dominated by the macro factor its not typical it doesnt change our longterm financial model mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and on the wonnotonboarded category can you size that to some degree and give us some sense of timing jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah i can give a sense of timing which is its actually its more back half of that were scheduling some of this stuff coming in play and that seems a long way away but its just thats us making sure and working very closely with clients make sure everything is lined up properly and from a sizing perspective we dont tend to give a number on that but what i can tell you is that its meaningfully higher than that aggregate is meaningfully higher than what it has been historically and pipeline and then the outside of the wonnotfunded the asset servicing business will tell you that the pipeline activity is also very high mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you bet thank you mike operator thank you one moment for next question our next question comes line of ken usdin from jefferies your line is open jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey morning jason hey followup on that organic growth side can you just talk about the wealth business and if you could also try to separate the markets from just where organic growth is there and any updates in terms of is there same type of hold back at all in terms of customers moving coming over bringing assets over given the environment jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah actually im really glad you asked that because the wealth businesses the journey is very different the wealth business the organic the growth there was higher first half of the year and the business is still doing well but they dont feel but the wonnotfunded is not as strong relative to history as the asset servicing business now both of those client channels will tell you importantly their win rates in the market are very attractive and they are very consistent with what they have been historically and so its just about for wealth their view is equity markets are lower less capital markets activity and its put just less money in motion and so yeartodate organic growth in wealth has been in line with historical levels first half strong frankly higher than normal second half looks lighter but money in motion is down fewer ipos fewer liquidity events but importantly their sense is their win rate in the market is consistent with what it has been historically ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then if i can just ask one followup to alexs question so if theres more room to go on the nim the challenge is overcoming the magnitude of that size decline in the balance sheet so how far out is your line of sight i know youre not going to give specific guidance but in terms of your nii growth being able to continue post the third quarter result jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp no i mean the way youre framing the algorithm is right its just we rates are its going to start to flatten out and our betas this coming quarter were anticipating betas of in this coming quarter and so the benefits are just flattening out but as rates go higher were still getting a benefit and the repricing of the securities portfolio is a positive lag effect to that effectively now all that said the volume levels matter a lot as well and just as rates were increasing we talked about the importance of loans thats where the real yield is but we cant ignore the fact that when volumes are coming down it puts pressure on the securities portfolio and on money market assets which has an impact less on nim but more on nii ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right i got it okay thank you northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp no thank you operator thank you one moment for next question our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken from ubs your line is open jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc oh hey jason im glad you said good morning because my line cut out when you said my name okay id love to ask a question about what youre seeing here so far number one just to clarify the billion to billion thats kind of like the range youve been seeing in deposits quartertodate right and assuming thats the case and as you said hard to predict but if we do end up seeing some continued pressure on the deposit side should we expect that wholesale funding line to plug the gap to the extent that afs securities cannot come down quick enough should we think that that line is going to continue to grow if the deposits remain under pressure jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah youre right in that thats we think thats the last fulfillment mechanism on the balance sheet and we dont use that theres no strategic initiative there to use it but it does in the short run in the short run act as the fulfillment mechanism depending on whats happening and the good news is theres a positive carry on that and rates are decent so it helps nii but we dont use it as a way to push and lever the balance sheet more than we need to we use it as effectively just a fulfillment mechanism brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay right so thats sort of the output to the extent that you dont have a that you need to plug that makes sense and then when we think about nonoperating deposits where do we stand in total for nonoperating versus where we were at the peak of the last rate hiking cycle have we retraced that decline and you spoke to the shifting of nonoperating from noninterestbearing and interestbearing im guessing thats whats driving up the betas what kind of magnitude impact does that because im guessing the nonop is a more demanding customer base on the beta side is that fair jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah it is it is for sure and theres actually another layer within there which weve talked about a little bit so its good for us to its fine for you to continue asking more detail on it but even within the nonoperational theres financial and nonfinancial and the financial nonoperational are the areas where theres the highest rate sensitivity and frankly its also the area we have to have the highest amount of runoff anticipation northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 and therefore its the area where we do the shortest and leastyielding investing on the other side of it and so that and youre right that component it continues to be the higher runoff in terms of volume level so far so if i look at the numbers it is across all the categories we look at its the single highest decline on a percentage basis even this quarter and that said theres declines in other areas as well and so even within the operational base was down ill call it to and but thats more that client base looking at different investment options and saying i might have with the yield curve at and flat at zero might not have been looking to ladder in treasury securities or look at an active fixed income portfolio but now theyre very much looking to do that as they talk to their advisors and so very different dynamics at play brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thanks for the color jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you bet michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp thank you operator thank you one moment for next question and our next question will come from the line of brian bedell from deutsche bank your line is open brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning good morning how are you doing jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp well brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 great just first one clarification on that deposit beta of that you just mentioned jason thats an incremental beta as opposed to say an absolute level that youd be out in the fourth quarter is that correct jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp well i want to make sure i understand so yes as we think about incremental rate changes brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp thats the beta that were experiencing on those incremental changes brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc on incremental yeah thats the one i want to clarify yeah jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp perfect brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then maybe just on expenses i guess one question just around the seasonality expectations because you do have some of the cost controls in place that you mentioned that you initiated in september so how should we think about the typical seasonal lift in outside services in equipment and software for example that we usually see and then also shortterm just the pension charges should we think of that as more recurring or really sort of youre kind of done with that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure ill hit the first one just on expenses and then lauren is here and can also talk on the pension settlement accounting issues so on expenses weve mentioned that depreciation is higher and so in equipment and software in particular were anticipating another lift in fourth quarter similar to what we had in third quarter and despite the expense actions were taking part of that is just baked into the our base right now particularly from a depreciation and amortization perspective that said well be looking hard at expenses even within that line item but weve also talked about the importance of us investing in technology but well see that similar lift going into fourth quarter and then consulting is without a doubt one of the key areas where were looking very hard to make sure that anything that comes on at this point is critical and that were handling that with a very high bar of what were doing but its very correlated in many instances as well to what were doing from equipment and software perspective with that lauren you want to talk on pension for a second northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 lauren e allnutt a executive vice president controller northern trust corp sure so as we think about pension we definitely would expect to see that recur in the fourth quarter the fact that we have triggered this accounting mechanism the settlement accounting does mean that our run rate of pension expense in the current year is lower but we will expect to see that in the fourth quarter it is difficult to predict whether thats something that we would expect to see going forward into brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay okay great and if i could just squeeze one more in there on expenses in terms of the onboarding of the clients do you also expect typically we see expenses in advance of that particularly if theyre more larger complex assignments in asset servicing is that a similar dynamic that we may see either now or in the first half of next year in advance of the onboarding of these clients michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp this is mike i would say weve already experienced some of that so as jason has mention some of these transitions just are taking longer for a number of reasons i think part of it too is that if you look at the pipeline right now on the asset servicing side its a high proportion of asset managers and those mandates just tend to take longer to transition in for asset owners and so weve been already have been at work in doing that and incurring some of the expenses that go with it and then as you point out as those start to transition in it kind of normalizes into the rate brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah perfect thanks so much for the color operator thank you one moment for next question our next question will come from the line of glenn schorr from evercore isi your line is open jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello there so i guess in some way youre a bit of a microcosm of the inflation issue we have in the market so my question on the expense side is is head count up comp up like and thats half the expense dollars so is it fair for me to assume that we could be more careful going forward but this higher level of dollars on employee comp and benefits is probably going to be with us for a while just like the market fears overall in other words you cant take comp away that you just gave michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 yeah glenn i think thats true in general just to expand on that i would say that for us at least weve gone through a time period here with inflation but also tremendous competition for the best talent and as you know thats where we look or one of the ways we look to differentiate ourselves so its very important to us to make sure that we were retaining the best talent and also attracting new talent as well and so yes weve had that increase in comp that has been a part of the run rate going forward the question is what happens to the rate of growth going forward were looking at that very carefully i would say but we need to be competitive on that front and then the other part as jason mentioned weve added a number of additional partners employees for us and thats something which was very appropriate as we invest in taking care of our clients invest in technology invest in resiliency so all makes sense we just going forward have to be really really focused on making sure that were only adding for very critical roles so that that growth rate of head count is appropriate glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i hear youre not alone there one question on when markets are going up a lot like they used to you would have plenty of clients that would have either fee ceilings or fee caps such that fees just dont scale up as markets go up my question is does it work that way in reverse markets fallen like this year do we have any protection on the way down whereas maybe fees might not drop as much as markets would imply going forward jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp so a couple of thoughts there one even within the contracts that are asset based a lot of the components of them are flat and so as you see increases and decreases the fee rates dont move in the same magnitude and secondly outside of that there are certain transactions that are charged for on a per unit basis and so that in of itself adds a layer thats uncorrelated in many ways to the level of assets and even this quarter one of the things we experienced as we think about organic growth in particular in the asset servicing business that was another dynamic transaction volumes were down and that may have had some correlation with markets being down but we actually think it was more correlated to just the volatility where a lot of the managers the asset manager clients we have were doing less because of the particularly currency volatility and so different dynamics at work but without a doubt trustees wont move in line with markets glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi yeah maybe one last one in wealth management big difference in the aum change yearonyear down versus down for asset servicing im assuming thats mostly mix and wealth management clients holding 20something percent in cash so i wonder if you could a confirm that and b talk about what wealth clients are now doing with all that cash jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so from a wealth perspective the clients may take a different approach in saying that theyre thinking about investing and they might its more of an asset class change for them an asset allocation change by class in the institutional market those clients will often think differently and they might be moving between providers they might be moving and maybe got more options to think about what their existing option sets are northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 i will say in general if you think about deposits and the money market funds combined the movements tend to not be as extreme and deposits might be a better place to look at that theyve actually just been flatter and so the wealth clients just tend to be ironically we all think about that component of the market maybe being more moving around more but i think its the nature of our specific clients that they tend to be to move less and just be more patient through cycles glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay thank you for all that jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator one moment for next question our next question comes line gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets your line is open jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning jason digging a little deeper into the decline yearoveryear of assets under custodyadministration you touched on it in your prepared remarks can you share with us how it breaks out between just market conditions and fixed income versus equity you already discussed a lot about the deposit issues and then also would the dollar may have contributed to that decline and lastly were there any customers that left jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure so auca was down call it markets were over half of that currency to your point and observation was about a third weve got a significant international exposure higher than what most people realize in auc in fact only is usd and then client outflows were the remainder and so not heavily significant portion of either auc or of the decline itself and importantly the decline in auc that was related to outflows it was related to largely our asset manager clients underlying business having outflows and our asset owners rebalancing but there was no material change in our client base or in our wallet share and the business just emphasizes that win rate continues to be high and consistent but this was a dynamic of our underlying clients having outflows and over time that works in our favor our clients do well and we grow with them this period was one where particularly the asset managers had outflows which impacted auc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 very good and then second asking the revenue question a little differently can you share with us what percentage of your fee revenues are variable rate priced meaning you charge maybe a couple of basis points to your customer as a percentage of assets under custody so as assets under custody go up and down revenues of course follow where does that stand today jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah maybe something just to give you a quick sound bite that we could come back on its different across asset servicing and let me offer a couple things that might be helpful to you in asset servicing of the fees are not asset value sensitive theyre driven by transaction volumes and account level fees or flat fees of the asset sensitive fees that about operate on a month lag and about on a quarter lag and if i transition to wealth management ill split it between the family office and the regions because theyre different in the family office its about a third of the fees are sensitive to equity markets in some ways and about are sensitive to the fixed income markets so close to half overall and then in the regions about half a little bit more are sensitive to equity markets but a quarter are sensitive to fixed income and so that should give you a good toolset to work from gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah it does thank you yeah thank you jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question will come from line of vivek juneja from jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp good morning vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions a couple of questions here capital your cet1 is down to mike youve always wanted to keep a gap versus your peers that gap has really disappeared for the moment what are you thinking especially if rates stay high for a while what is your plan in terms of trying to bring back that gap michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 so vivek youre right as to our objective on capital there and i would say that hasnt changed what has changed as you know with rates the impact of aoci on that and so over time that will accrete back into capital and thats our plan if you will is to allow the capital ratio to continue to be in the range that weve had for some time period right now its just in the lower part of that range as a result of aoci vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so no plans to shrink the balance sheet or anything in the nearterm to try and do anything about it michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so i would say there are no specific plans around that vivek but we do look at riskweighted assets very closely because thats a proxy then for the amount of capital thats being deployed in that activity and are we getting the right return jason talked about the size of the balance sheet earlier and the fact that we do get positive returns across all of those activities but some of them more than others and so weve never looked to just expand the balance sheet if it was going to be in lowreturning activities and so that will be the same and in this environment every dollar of rwa is precious vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it different question a little detailed one jason you mentioned other operating expenses were down due to lower miscellaneous expenses is it sustainable this lower run rate given the cost sort of focus that youve got or is that just temporary and comes back jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp theres a lot of different factors going within that line item and so its just a difficult one to predict we try to call out the big moves but difficult to say that theres any trend within that theres nothing wed call out at this point vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay yeah one last one if i may you mentioned investment management seeing outflows how much and which products are you seeing there jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp across aum in general the declines about the majority of that is within asset servicing and then from an asset class to your perspective its a combination of mostly cash but also equity and then also sec lending cash collateral pools but at the same time markets drove about of the decline and currency was the remaining approximately vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp youre welcome operator thank you one moment for our next question we have a followup from the line of brennan hawken from ubs your line is open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hey thanks for taking my followup you touched briefly on this before jason but could you give us an updated currency mix of the deposits and whether or not the fx moves weve seen has caused some shift there jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yes give me a second mark or jennifer if you get it before i do mark beatty a vice president senior relationship manager northern trust corp yeah this is mark the usd deposits youre asking about the currency mix of deposits brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah exactly currency mix of deposits mark beatty a vice president senior relationship manager northern trust corp yeah yeah so in the current quarter its a little bit over thats us so its us and then as you go down for total deposits a little bit more than is pound a little more than is euro and then you get to aussie dollar which is also right around and then rest are kind of spread out among the remaining or so to but not a significant change from what weve seen before even though the volumes have come down brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then earlier on expenses you guys spoke to taking some actions on expenses to try to diminish some of the inflationary pressure is it possible to give some color or help us think about what kind of magnitude we should be expecting as far as those action goes those potential actions go and what the timing would be jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp ill hit on timing and from that perspective its we started and announced internally these higher levels of controls in early midseptember and so were already seeing some beneficial impact from that and certainly change in the heightening of the bar on what were bringing in and again weve got to emphasize there are still things that we think about from an investment perspective to the extent we have growth were going to follow that growth with appropriate level of investment northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 but this is also about productivity and making sure that we address inflation very aggressively those are the two components that were looking at and weve taken more of a five quarter approach to this years planning process for to ensure we work hard on fourth quarter so that we maximize our ability to do well and be where we want to be coming into next year and from a magnitude perspective too early were not going to give the numbers on that at this point just it is noteworthy enough that we wanted to make sure to communicate that this is something that its been a pivot and a significant increase in the controls around higher level around spend increases brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay but just framing it is it best to think about because you said that this is about addressing the inflation and whatnot and youre not stopping the investment course but given the challenging environment so if we think about this could help to offset some of the recent inflationary pressure that you saw this year so its about like bringing the growth rate down right is that the right way to think about it or is it more containing further pressure and sort of like stopping it from continuing to go higher jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp well its both if we go by and its a good thing for you to encourage us to frame it and so lets just come back to the way we usually we always talk about our expenses which is around productivity inflation growth and investing and if we use that framework typically wed like to see productivity offset inflation thats a lot easier to do when inflation is at inflation at its very difficult but that should tell you we are going to be looking extremely hard at productivity and where we can look at our existing base of business and find opportunities to be more efficient and then in the concept of investing thats where you just have to have a high bar and we have to say our growth rate historically has been high but weve accomplished a lot of the things we wanted to do in wealth management we went through digital metamorphosis in our infrastructure we went through weve gotten a lot of work done on migrating to the cloud in our risk and cyber and regulatory bucket weve done a lot of investing to ensure that the brand that we have is protected well and those are the three components around technology spending importantly that were talking about things internally so that infrastructure foundational piece is one the second is that middle layer of risk regulatory cyber and the third is around whats clientdriven and there are opportunities in each of those but the risk regulatory cyber is one where indiscernible were going to ensure that were doing everything we need to do there to make sure we are where we should be as a franchise the other two buckets weve got to think about pacing weve got to think about who were using to help us on those things there are levers we can pull and then that last overall bucket of what do we do from a growth perspective to the extent that theres good business out there for us to bring on were going to do it and we care as much about the organic growth of the company as about wanting to make sure that the expense growth rate is where it should be brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for taking my followups northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp no thanks for encouraging the framework hopefully thats helpful operator one moment for next question our next question will come from the mike brown from kbw your line is open jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp mike are you there michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for taking my questions jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp sure michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i just wanted to ask about the volatility that we saw in the gilt market we saw some headlines about some challenges related to processing for your business can you give us some context around the situation there and will there be any financial impact related to the volatility there and specifically for your business michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so mike youve given the background there largely just that there has been a significant amount of both volumes and volatility in the gilt market and we have a meaningful client base of uk pensions that are affected by that and a number of those pension clients also utilize liabilitydriven investment strategies and managers that provide those strategies and likewise we have some very meaningful clients on that front so weve been in the middle of that volume and volatility and have been doing everything thats required to be able to handle that needless to say it has presented challenges for all of the players in that marketplace as it continued to work its way through and i would say still uncertain and our expectation is that although some of the volumes may have come down here more recently we are prepared that they could pick back up again and that the volatility has not gone away and so from that perspective weve been very focused on taking care of the clients making sure that everything is getting done and i would say as far as any particular financial exposure or anything like that theres no change to the business model for us or necessarily exposures or things like that michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 okay very good thank you and just on share buybacks i dont think we really heard much about that on this call and certainly were very low this quarter and if i heard jasons comment correctly before it sounds like a lot of focus will probably be on rebuilding the cet1 ratio so is it fair to assume that the buybacks will probably be relatively muted here and maybe just dependent on how the aoci accretes back into capital or just any thoughts on the framework for thinking about buybacks would be helpful jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp yeah i think you got it largely right that with aoci at billion to billion on a cumulative basis thats a high amount we care about our cet1 levels and weve got obviously the weve got strong very strong capital positions but we think about it so much on a relative basis as well and in an aggregate basis and so we feel good about the capital levels but also have id say a bias toward making sure we stay relatively where we want michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you jason jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp you bet operator one moment for next question we have a followup from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you jason and jason just a quick followup on the beta that you mentioned incrementally for the upcoming quarter is what you pointed out two parts to the question how does that compare to the last tightening cycle is at this point normal or similar i should say not normal and second if rates continue to go higher lets say another to basis points will the incremental beta approach jason j tyler a chief financial officer executive vice president northern trust corp so in terms of where it is relative to prior cycles it has not been linear in this cycle each rate hikes seems to have its own dynamic to it and another dynamic is that historically weve seen most of the dynamic come from the fed but this cycle and the mix of our deposits theres more impact from nonusd currencies and so youve got to play that in as well its really important and then to the second and those betas also behave very differently and then also our wealth even within usd the wealth deposits behave differently they dont flatten out as much even at higher levels from here which gets to the second part of your question does it level off completely at some point it does and not up another basis points for sure but each currency behaves differently and depending on where we are behaves differently too betas are very high in nonusd negative rates you can imagine clients who are highly demanding of getting of the benefit as they were in negative territory as they got to zero and a little bit above the conversations change and then also the dynamics of what northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2022 do alternatives look like and so the shape of the yield curve matters and so all those things come into play but the direct answer is we dont anticipate a flattening even with another basis point lift but well continue to see higher betas as we get there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then mike just a followup on the pension answer that you gave over with the london or uk accounts is it safe to assume that you guys are primarily acting as agent for those customers rather than any balance sheet risk or youre not underwriting ldi products michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp correct so we are not an ldi product provider if you will on the asset management side and youre right were the asset servicer for either the uk pension or for the ldi manager thats our client and so yes were acting as agent for them now with sales of gilts with moving collateral around theres a tremendous amount of movement of cash and bonds as a part of that and so we will act as a go between because of that and so that can create temporary exposures if you will which is what would be the case thats normal as part of the offering that we have for them and i would just add that with all of the increases in volumes and volatility that i talked about which have been multiples of what is normally the case weve put additional resources to every doing everything we can to make sure that we can handle those so thats really been our position on it and again we cant predict where its going to go but were trying to be prepared for this to continue for some time gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no very helpful thank you michael g ogrady a chairman chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator thank you and that concludes our qa for today id like to turn the call back over to jennifer childe for any closing remarks jennifer childe senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern
