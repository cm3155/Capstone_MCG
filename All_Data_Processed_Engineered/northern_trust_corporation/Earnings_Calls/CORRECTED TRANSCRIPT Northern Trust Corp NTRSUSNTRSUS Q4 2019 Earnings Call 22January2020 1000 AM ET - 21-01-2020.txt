earnings per share were and our return on common equity was the current quarters results included a million charge recorded in other operating income related to the decision to sell substantially all of the lease portfolio and a million software disposition charge recorded within equipment and software expense as you can see on the bottom of page the macroeconomic environment was mixed while equity markets were strong shortterm interest rates in the us declined both on a sequential as well as yearoveryear basis lets move to page and review the financial highlights of the fourth quarter yearoveryear revenue increased with noninterest income up from one year ago and net interest income flat expenses increased from northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 last year the provision for credit losses was a credit of million in the current quarter compared to a credit of million one year ago net income was down yearoveryear in a sequential comparison revenue increased with both noninterest income and net interest income up expenses increased compared to the prior quarter net income declined sequentially return on average common equity was for the quarter down from one year ago and in the prior quarter assets under custodyadministration of trillion increased compared to one year ago and were up on a sequential basis assets under custody of trillion were up compared to one year ago and up sequentially assets under management were trillion up on a yearoveryear basis and up on a sequential basis lets look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page fourth quarter revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was billion up compared to last year and up sequentially trust investment and other servicing fees represent the largest component of our revenue and were million in the fourth quarter up from last year and up sequentially foreign exchange trading income was million in the fourth quarter down yearoveryear and up sequentially the yearoveryear decline was primarily related to lower foreign exchange swap activity in our treasury function other noninterest income was million in the fourth quarter down compared to one year ago and down sequentially other operating income included the aforementioned million loss relating to the lease portfolio excluding the leaserelated loss the yearoveryear growth was driven by implementation of a bank owned life insurance program during and strong security commissions and trading income the sequential growth excluding the lease portfolio loss was primarily driven by favorability in the visarelated swap net interest income which ill discuss in more detail later was million in the fourth quarter flat with the prior period and up sequentially now lets look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page for our corporate institutional services business fees totaled million in the fourth quarter and were up yearoveryear and up on a sequential basis custody and fund administration fees the largest component of cis fees were million and up yearoveryear and up on a sequential basis the yearoveryear performance was primarily driven by new business and favorable equity markets performance on a sequential basis was primarily driven by favorable currency translation and favorable markets assets under custody and administration for cis clients were trillion at quarter end up yearover year and up sequentially both the yearoveryear and sequential performance was primarily driven by higher markets new business and favorable currency translation recall that lag market values factor into the quarters fees with both quarterlag and monthlag market impacting our cis custody and fund administration fees investment management fees in cis of million in the fourth quarter were up yearoveryear and up sequentially the yearoveryear performance was driven by new business and favorable markets the sequential performance was primarily due to favorable markets assets under management for cis were billion up yearoveryear and up sequentially the year overyear increase was driven by favorable markets and new business as well as an increase in end of period securities lending collateral levels weve had strong success within our liquidity products with significant growth in our institutional cash funds the sequential increase is primarily driven by markets partially offset by a decline in periodend securities lending collateral levels securities lending fees were million in the fourth quarter up yearoveryear and up sequentially the yearoveryear increase is primarily driven by higher volumes northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 while the sequential increase is primarily driven by higher spreads securities lending collateral was billion at quarter end and averaged billion across the quarter average collateral levels increased yearoveryear and were down sequentially moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were million in the fourth quarter and were up compared to the prior quarter and up sequentially both the yearoveryear and sequential increases were driven by favorable markets and new business assets under management were billion at quarter end up yearoveryear and up sequentially the increases were primarily driven by favorable markets moving on to page net interest income was million in the fourth quarter and flat compared to the prior year earning assets averaged billion in the quarter down from the prior year total deposits averaged billion and were down versus the prior year the net interest margin was in the fourth quarter and was up basis points from the year ago the improvement in the net interest margin compared to the prior year primarily reflects the balance sheet mix shift and the impact of lower foreign exchange swap volume partially offset by lower shortterm interest rates versus one year ago on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was up average earning assets increased on a sequential basis while the net interest margin declined basis points its worth noting that net interest income results in the quarter did include approximately million in various one time nonrepeating items during the quarter we also added to our bankowned life insurance program that was first put in place during the second quarter compared to the prior quarter this quarters net interest income declined by approximately as a result of the additional boli while other operating income benefited by million the full quarterly run rate will be reached in the first quarter of with an additional net interest income decline of approximately million and other operating income increase of million on a sequential basis looking at the currency mix of our balance sheet for the fourth quarter us dollar deposits represented of our total deposits this is down from one year ago and in the prior quarter turning to page expenses were billion in the fourth quarter and were higher than the prior year and higher versus the prior quarter compensation expense totaled million and was up compared to one year ago the yearoveryear growth was primarily related to higher salaries driven by base pay adjustments and staff growth partially offset by lower incentive expense on a sequential basis compensation was up the sequential increase was partially due to higher salary expense driven by staff growth and unfavorable currency translation partially offset by lower cashbased incentive accruals employee benefit expense of million was up from one year ago and was up sequentially the year overyear growth was primarily driven by higher payroll taxes while the sequential growth was primarily due to increased medical costs now this pertains to our benefits expense in due to changes in underlying assumptions we expect to see an increase in fullyear pension expense of just over million which represents a increase in our overall total expense base outside services costs of million were up on a yearoveryear basis and up sequentially the year overyear growth was primarily driven by higher technical services consulting and legal expense the sequential increase was primarily due to higher legal and consulting services as well as costs related to increased business volumes including brokerage clearing market data subcustody and thirdparty advisor fees northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 equipment and software expense of million was up from one year ago and up sequentially both the yearoveryear and sequential growth were impacted by the previously mentioned software disposition charge of million the yearoveryear growth also reflects higher depreciation and amortization while higher software amortization costs contributed to the sequential increase occupancy expense of million was up from one year ago and up sequentially both the yearover year and sequential increases were driven by higher rents and building operation costs related to our workplace real estate strategies other operating expense of million was down from one year ago and down sequentially the sequential decrease was driven primarily by the northern trust sponsored golf tournament in the prior quarter partially offset by increases in advertising staffrelated and other operating expense categories as weve discussed on previous calls through our value for spend initiative that we started in weve been realigning our expense base with the goal of realizing million in expense run rate savings by our current quarter results reflect approximately million in expense savings or million in annualized run rate savings our efforts around value for spend and productivity more broadly will not cease as we further embed a culture of sustainable expense management across the company expense management is a core emphasis and we continue to focus on striking the right balance between productivity growth and investing in the business now turning to full year our results in are summarized on page net income was billion down compared to and earnings per share were flat with the prior year on the right margin of this page we outlined the nonrecurring impacts that were called out for both years we achieved a return on equity for the year of compared to in the full year revenue and expense trends are outlined on page trust investment and other servicing fees grew in the growth during the year was primarily driven by new business in favorable markets partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency translation foreign exchange trading income declined driven by a decrease in foreign exchange swap activity within our treasury function as well as decreases in market volatility and lower client volumes net interest income increased average earning assets during the year declined by while net interest margin increased basis points the net result was growth in overall revenue on a reported basis in on a reported basis expenses were up from the prior year adjusting for the expense charges in both and that are on the prior page expenses were also up from and turning to page our capital ratios remain strong with our common equity tier ratio of under the standardized approach and under the advanced approach the supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation is and at the bank was both of which exceed the minimum requirement during the fourth quarter we declared cash dividends totaling million to common stockholders and repurchased million shares of common stock at a cost of million these two factors combined represent a payout ratio of approximately for the quarter northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 also during the fourth quarter northern trust issued million in perpetual preferred stock at a fixed for life dividend rate of callable in five years fixed rate dividends for this new issuance are expected to be paid on a quarterly basis with the first dividend declared at our board of directors meeting earlier this week and to be paid april of given the november issuance the initial preferred dividend payment will cover approximately five months and therefore is expected to equal million in the first quarter of going forward these fixed rate dividends are expected to be million per quarter the proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem all outstanding shares of series c preferred stock on january first quarter results will include million in accelerated series crelated costs now let me turn the call back over to mike for closing comments michael g ogrady chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp before we open up the call for qa i wanted to close by talking about our key financial objectives and our performance against these in our primary financial target is to achieve a return on average common equity of between to for our roe of was at the high end of that range this was the sixth consecutive year we have achieved our targeted roe we are also focused on driving profitable growth and have objectives to achieve both fee operating leverage and positive operating leverage although we have achieved positive fee operating leverage in of the last years and positive operating leverage in of the last years we did not achieve those for as we enter we are continuing to rapidly evolve the company by providing differentiated services and experiences to our clients and investing in innovative capabilities to do more for our existing clients and gain new clients we combine this with our intense focus on improving our productivity to profitably grow the company and create value for our stakeholders this concludes our prepared remarks thank you again for participating in northern trusts fourth quarter earnings conference call today jason mark and i would be happy to answer your questions david could you please open the line northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 question and answer section operator absolutely operator instructions and our first question will come from alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey guys good morning everybody mike picking up on the last point i guess when you talk about operating leverage i guess over the last few quarters you guys talked about getting organic expense growth to be in line with organic fee growth not just total fee growth i guess question number one there is the organic fee growth still in the to kind of range as you look out into and then secondly should we expect you to achieve this level of expense growth for the full year sort of despite the fact that markets are starting off on a very strong point and that should naturally create more kind of pressure or more tailwinds rather to fees and im just wondering whether or not this sort of level of expense growth could be sustainable into michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp so alex i think youre thinking about the framework the right way which is as i mentioned earlier we are focused on the objective of generating positive fee operating leverage and underneath that is the goal to achieve that on an organic basis as well knowing that that is a higher bar if you will but the reason why we focus on an organic basis is because just as you indicated when markets are stronger we expect that well get more positive fee operating leverage from that its more challenging to achieve that in ill call it lower growth environments than when we do have the tailwinds but thats why its important to have that primary objective around organic in we did not achieve the organic fee operating leverage and thats something that certainly as far as what were shooting for were trying to get that so that if we would have achieved it we wouldve had positive fee operating leverage here for the year and going into its the same objective now as jason talked about and can go into more detail there are certain aspects of the expense base that roll in in this case pension as he mentioned for example million increase to the year we still look to cover that if you will and try to just focus on the productivity objectives to try to overcome things like that as well so the goals havent changed from year to year we can have different challenges to achieve it but as far as what were trying to achieve its the same objective alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for that and then jason one cleanup for you for nir it sounded like there was million of one time i believe it was a benefit in  can you flesh that out a little bit so what are those benefits and maybe help us bridge the kind of the right jumping off point for  nir as we ph zone in on the quarter here thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 yes youve got the headline number right it was about million its a combination of a couple of different items theres some ph premium in and then one thing we didnt headline much but we did have a payoff of a loan that was on nonaccrual we picked up another million in interest on that and then the fte adjustment was a couple of million dollars higher so you add those factors together and you get to the million operator thank you our next question will come from jim mitchell with buckingham research james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc hey good morning guys can we just talk a little bit about the periodend balance sheet it really kind of spiked should we take that as just sort of transitory because if you look at average balances they werent up that much or is there something thats continuing into that we should maybe up our assumptions around deposit growth given fed actions et cetera jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah youre right it was high i actually looked back to see if this was a record high it wasnt but it was close but more importantly it has come back down obviously as you know the balance sheet tends to spike at the end of the quarters and particularly the end of the years this was higher than normal not a record but already weve seen more normalization as some of the large clients have put money back to work into the market in different ways james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc okay thanks and then maybe just to follow up on the comp line and expenses going forward just on you had head count growth of so how do we think about that kind of upward pressure from head count growth versus your desire to kind of the scalable digitization trying to keep core expense growth below organic growth but were kind of starting off with a much higher employee base how do we think about the comp line specifically jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah well a couple of things and maybe you might be looking at page of the press release and you get the comp line there and i look at it more on  versus  and you got a growth rate there so the first thing from my lens is to say what was revenue growth what was really trusty growth over that timeframe and it was about so first of all on that comp line even though its a tiny bit higher than we like to see we did get leverage in that which is good and were in a year where we got revenue up a lot of our revenue growth is going to bring with it expense growth and its going to hit in just about every one of the key expense line items including comp the second thing for us to think about is that in general weve got the technology investment that were making and so part of the reason that number might be a little higher is that some of the tech investments that were making in the business are coming through in that comp line and third just so you guys are thinking about it the right way coming into the next year were always going to have effectively call it million to million base pay adjustment for the comp line and so when you think northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 about that on the base of business that we have here thats going to lead to almost a point in and of itself in the growth so those are just a couple of ways different lenses to think about that line item james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc okay thanks a lot thats helpful jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning hi i just wanted to follow up a little bit on that regarding just technology in general i know in the past youve given some insight on what your tech budget is maybe you could give us a little sense as to how you see that trajecting over time i know you aint give guidance but just to understand do you think that trajectory is accelerating decelerating and then how you see that shifting over time comp versus noncomp as it relates to tech thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah so its obviously weve got a high sense of urgency as we think about expenses in general and tech where it is outsized relative to the other areas and so youre right to hone in on it a couple of data points as you think about next year one is as i take a step back we thought about what we wanted to convey that we know about we dont want to give guidance on expenses but we do want to tell you what we know at this point and there are some things that we have high degree of certainty of as we sit at this point coming into so i want to do those in three buckets just to put those out one i hinted to a couple minutes ago and that comes down to the compensation line we know that were going to see in general about somewhere between million million just in base pay adjustments based on the business that we have secondly we talked about pension being a little over million higher and then third is we have a sense right now of what it depreciation is going to look like and thats about million higher for the year in than it will be as we look back on now some of that is reflected in the fourth quarter and so we can its hard for us to divulge much of it but we do know that on a audio gap higher so those are three key items that i think everybody we want to make sure everybody is aware of because weve got clear line of sight on it at this point and the second more broadly is we think about how do we depict the it budget and this it increase it is actually hitting in a lot of different line items so just we were talking about page on the press release a minute ago northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 stay there for a second and if you look at these different line items i actually went back and pulled out it from each of the different components that you can see externally to get a sense of how much theyre impacting those growth areas because i do look at not just comp which we were talking about a second ago but all of those line items to try and get a sense of whether were getting leverage there and obviously it hits very heavily in equipment and software which is why youll see that line item be pretty elevated but theres also smaller but still meaningful impacts that will hit in obviously compensation employee benefits and outside services betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and is it still around billion that youre thinking the tech budget was in i recall that was the estimate that was given most recently mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah betsy this is mark yeah we look at it kind of in a threeyear rolling average so a little bit over billion per year and that includes both operating expense as well as capital investments betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from brian bedell with the deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks very much maybe just a question on nii is there any impact on future net interest income from the sale of the leasing portfolio and if so if you can quantify that and then also if you can talk about what youre seeing for deposit trends into so far jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so on well i just want to write down deposit trends very good on the impact of norlease on nim very de minimis increase nothing to really think about thats pretty clean accounting perspective on how that was set and then secondly on deposit trends coming in more broadly i know that its first of all its a strategic focus for us across the business on both the wealth side and on the cis side and weve talked about on the wealth side in particular we told you about some strategic initiatives we had there that brought some money out of the funds onto the balance sheet thats held in pretty well and then id say on the institutional side of the business its more volatile and theres no the initiatives that we have there arent as aggressive as what weve been thinking about on the wealth side but were still doing everything we can to make sure were getting a good share of our deposits good deposits coming in from clients as the custody grows and as were talking to clients across the globe northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc on an averaging basis are you expecting growth in based on those initiatives i know the end of period was elevated of course but if we think about it averagetoaverage jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i think there was if you think about the asset side and then the funding side if you think about nim is that the only other item there of note there was a little bit and a couple billion dollars higher on that but that didnt really come more from the deposit side it came more from tradingrelated activity and so theres nothing id call out at this point that would lead you to say that deposits would be moderately or significantly different brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then on organic growth i think you commented on wealth management aum being up mostly from the markets just want to get a sense thats been a strong driver of organic growth for you guys for a while i just want to get a sense of the cadence of the organic growth trends in wealth management versus the asset servicing business and as you think about expenses are we still thinking about a comparable growth rate in expense growth even with those headwinds that youve mentioned on the comp pension and the it side is that still reasonable to think of a rate of growth that would be similar to the organic growth if thats still trending towards the midsingle digits jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp let me hit the top side first on the growth side and the trends within the wealth business the business is continuing to do well and mike touched on earlier this year there are some really nice differentiated approaches that that business has in the market with growth here in wealth management resonates very well as the trend there that continues to be seen and come through on the financials and you guys are able to see this actually that were doing well at the very top end of the market so the family office business is growing faster and you can see that in the numbers we report on both a sequential basis and a yearoveryear basis that trend has been going on for a while and its attractive and then the second component to how well see the expenses line differently between the business im going to separate it in a couple of ways one is that the techrelated expenses apply a little bit more toward the cis side of the business as we think about things like matrix and our strategic operating model those things are going to be allocated a little bit more toward the cis side of the business that said the wealth side of the business is also investing in different ways and theyre working hard on digitizing the business mike talked about that earlier that were probably a little ahead in our investments there on the cis side wealth is starting to think more about how to reflect the digital transformation that weve seen across the marketplace and how we can take our position with things like indiscernible and wealth management make it even more accessible to clients have even better interactions and have better foundational technology brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and were still thinking about organic growth in that sort of midsingle digit area on a goforward basis low to mid single digit northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp brian just to confirm are you talking about wealth or the corporation as a whole brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the company as a whole michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so maybe just to address that brian kind of across the businesses so jason talked about wealth management we continue to see as you mentioned healthy solid growth in that business thats the nature of it and again our strategic imperative in that business is to increase or accelerate that growth even more were still seeing a higher growth rate in our asset servicing business and so that continues its at the lower end of its range but it continues to grow at a healthy rate and the strategic imperative for that business is we have to continue that growth but we want to see that growth be more scalable and then i would just also add with our asset management business were all well aware of the secular trends in the industry there and i would say that certainly impacted our asset management business although comparatively the business is performing well and so its experiencing positive organic growth just meaning theyre able to increase the flows but also then change the mix in such a way that it is offsetting the fee compression that youre seeing across the industry so its positive having said that it is at a lower rate than the other two businesses so you put that all together to your point weve talked about the organic growth rate for our fees at the company level kind of being midsingle digits thats still the case were at the lower end of that right now so what does that mean well thats why were focused on our growth strategies and executing on those but thats why one of our other key priorities for the company is on continually improving our productivity and when we are at the lower end of the growth side we have to work just that much harder on the expense side to get more savings if you will on the expense side so thats the strategy if you will and again focused on trying to execute that so that we can deliver the positive fee operating leverage operator thank you our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks a lot hey jason can you expand a little bit more on underneath the fact that you said that some of the balances might have gone off the balance sheet can you help us understand either how much you saw as like the overgrowth in the earning assets this quarter and then secondarily if rates stay stable from here can you talk us through the dynamics of nim in terms of how much asset repricing has to come through and how much deposit repricing you can still see happen now that weve gone to a more stable level thanks northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so on the first i think as these spikes happened late in the quarter its frankly a relatively short period of time that these spikes are on the balance sheet and so it comes in late and it leaves pretty early and were not doing anything fancy when those dollars come in and so frankly it just doesnt impact the overall nim very much it does spike the we obviously look through the balance sheet on a daily basis it spikes it but it doesnt i dont think it really drives nim that much at the end of the day and then as we look out into next quarter i dont think that spike should necessarily be reflected in your thought process as you think about so thats more from a volume perspective although i did hint earlier that kind of that billion increase in the securities portfolio i do think thats likely to come down and that had more to do with i think more idiosyncratic trading that was happening at the time nothing abnormal were trading some more longerdated securities and the securities settlement process led to higher securities being on and thats really what led to that little bit of an average increase and i think thatll abate as we think about the rates going forward into first quarter the thing that we can all see that well have maybe more of an impact than what people realize is that fed funds the libor spread and that did have an impact in fourth quarter and when we talk to everyone at the conference we attended and then on the last call we were looking at spread theres more probably or basis points and we thought that was going to go away it actually held in it even expanded a little bit but now that compression that we anticipated has actually come to fruition and if you look at that delta right now its more on the basis point land and so that is a factor that if that holds in that would have an impact on what we would think about for nim for next quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then do you have the ability to reprice much on the right side of the balance sheet can you just talk to us about customer dynamics outside of just market index type of deposits like hows the discussion going with clients and what opportunities do you still have to reduce rate jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah just so incredibly different between the businesses and so on the institutional side first of all the deposits there are driven a lot more by our emea clients and in that book those clients are shopping in real time and so were making very tight decisions on those and were going to get what the market gives us frankly and were not in a position to be a price leader there now on the other side of the business the wealth business very different dynamics and there we talk again about the fact that we sunsetted an anchor suite product and we brought assets from the funds out of the balance sheet were looking much more there and can think about what we want to be strategically in the marketplace and to give you some headlines on how we talk about it we want to be very attractive for large depositors and so thats where were going to be much more competitive and for more of the retail client base were going to be less competitive but at the top end of the market there were always trying to figure out how to attract and be extremely aggressive about retaining our top depositors operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so just wanted to start off with a question on capital i know that in the past youve discussed the business need to manage to higher ratios to ensure you dont deviate meaningfully at least from some of your gsib peers that are running closer to 12plus given that youre competing with some of these firms for rfps and i was hoping you could maybe just unpack or speak to some of the competitive considerations such as rfps versus regulatory constraints it looks like the regulatory changes are swinging in the right way in terms of slr relief potential for the elimination of leverage constraints in ccar im just wondering if some of those changes come through how that informs your willingness or appetite to manage to a lower target over time michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp its mike why dont i start off so first of all as you would expect we feel very good about our capital levels and our flexibility with regards to capital as youve highlighted we are always cognizant and focused on what the implications would be on the business for our capital levels and that can play into formalized rfp processes where yes we want to compare favorably to some of our competitors but also just more broadly and ill say even subjectively with our wealth management business dealing with large family offices they are looking for safety and security conservative strong balance sheet and so its a part of the business strategy for us having said that like any resource it needs to be balanced and so were comfortable with where we are to your point were cognizant of where our competitor capital levels are and to the extent that those move that gives us more flexibility on that front and then the last thing i would add is from a regulatory lens as youve talked about there are changes on the regulatory front having said that theyve also recently recategorized banks were a category bank we happen to be the only category bank which we take as a compliment reflecting the unique nature of our business model but it also does mean once again we have to work our way through whatever changes that may mean as far as capital management for us were not concerned about anything per se but there just is some uncertainty until they fully roll out the implications of category on capital management expectations steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no very helpful color and just one followup for me just a cleanup question on the other income line even when we adjust for the onetimers in the quarter it looks like that was a source of revenue strength and i was hoping to gauge the sustainability of some of that strength versus the million core level in and just given some of the guidance on bolirelated impacts how we should think about what could be a reasonable or appropriate run rate for that line in recognizing theres always marktomarket and other noise northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp steven hi its mark as you said if you adjust for the lease we would have been at closer to the million mark there was the boli benefit came into that line that will continue to have a little bit of a bump up in the first quarter like jason said i would say that the marktomarket adjustment on the indiscernible was favorable this quarter about a million sequential benefit which there was more of a negative drag on that last quarter for some of the adjustments that we made there this quarter when you take that into account as well as the boli we did have a little bit higher miscellaneous income and credit and bankrelated fees probably higher than normal one way that i would say that you can look at that line because it does move around is if you do strip out some of the non recurring items that weve had in that line youre probably looking at an average of about million over the last several quarters and then in theory you could layer boli on top of that that would be one way to look at it steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great thanks for taking my questions michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp hi brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions i just had a followup from a few of the questions that have been asked so far and just wanted to try and frame it in the best way to think about nii and jason i know welcome to the circus our quarterly circus here with your first call i know your predecessor had started to help us think about one quarter out nii i know that was a departure from northerns normal course of business i dont know what your plan is going forward but it does seem like theres a lot of noise so if you could help us frame how to think about you guys sold some of the lease portfolio so im guessing we need to shrink that average earning asset bucket a bit weve got an overearning of about million youve got the tighter fed fund to libor how should we think about how all this will weigh on nii as we go into based on what youve seen so far jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp right well brennan i think you got all the pieces the way i think about leaning into it another couple items one you talked about the onetimers of its really million million secondly i mentioned the libor to fed fund spread i think thats a very important one as you think about how to model this out northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 and then you mentioned boli which having that in place now for a full quarter because remember we didnt have it in place last year the benefit of that even if you just assume the same type of economics that we experienced this time should be a positive million and then lastly we havent talked about day count is going to work against us if youre thinking about that on a sequential basis will go from not to but to with leap year but those are the in my mind those are the big four buckets to use as a starting point brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that and then when we think about the average balance sheet it looked like there was a bit of a jump in the other liabilities this quarter and its at the highest level that its been in a couple of years by about billion is that temporary obviously it was enough to skew the average balance for the fourth quarter so is there something unusual happening that will prove sustainable or should we just expect that to wind down in jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thats us hinting at earlier that it had to do with more the nature of the securities we were trading that had more time and were in settlement mode for longer and so thats what i think will drive bringing that the securities portfolio down to a more normalized level brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay like tbas or something jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp could be abs tbas and mortgages nothing we dont normally do just with a little higher mix of those items that led to higher level of security sitting and obviously were not getting the yield on those as theyre sitting and ph settling the other thing id just mention i think its yeah youre right there is kind of a lot of question about where nim is going and we had gotten in a mode of talking about what we expect and effectively providing guidance and ill say at this point we do think nim will be down to but nii will be down to and so its not to say that every quarter were going to give that but i do think with we gave you guys a handful of different items that you had to square off to get a good launch point and so i think putting it out there this quarter is fair brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay terrific and thats off the reported number in right the billion what we should base that minus to jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp off of the reported net interest income of million right northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sorry sorry yeah yeah thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp million and so thats not indicating just to be super clear its not indicating the million it is going to be down to just the million wed expect to be down about to based on the items i walked through brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it nii not nim jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp right brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah operator thank you our next question comes from michael carrier with the bank of america michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning thanks for taking michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp hi mike michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi thanks for taking the question dont want to focus too much on one year but when you look at the like not hitting the offleverage target was that more of a function of higher necessary investments that came up during the year or was it lighter organic growth than maybe you expected and since you mentioned some of the expense items heading into on comp pension and tech are there any areas like maybe real estate that you could see some savings given some of the repositioning that you guys have been working on northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah ill start with the second which we have mentioned that we expect occupancy to be higher in the short run as we got some double lease double rent payments that we have effectively and so those who have been exposed to it were going through a transition of very large number of seats from a building weve been in for a long time in chicago to a new building were starting to move people in this month a lot of the move is going to take place next month and so were right in the midst of that and so you can imagine were still obviously paying rent in the old facility and also weve started a new facility theres a lot of work that goes around making sure that move is taking place and there are other areas around the footprint overall from a real estate perspective thats going to lead to a higher level of rent in the first half of this year now in the second half of the year we should get some benefits from that and so thats something that well actually see come down well eventually grow into that run rate but were expecting to actually see that line come down in the second half of the year mike anything you want to add to that michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah just to the first part of your question there about the year and again it is a year but part of the trend there and so what came out of that one much broader perspective pulling back from it is if you look at our expense base overall im going to call them technology expenses so this is the expenses for our technology group and the it depreciation and amortization represents about of our cost base and that grew at if you look at the other of our cost base it grew at about and so i would say across that for the most part we hit on the costs related to the business to bringing on new clients and importantly hitting on our value for spend initiative and the objectives there so its not that we didnt achieve those and then you say well on the technology side what happened there and there if you think about technology or as i think about technology theres three primary things that were trying to achieve there one is security two is stability and three is scalability within our technology and if you look at the costs that were related to that in the year they were costs that we had on the safety and stability part which ended up being higher than we would have expected going into the year but are things that you absolutely do in order to make sure that you are being able to provide the value proposition if you will for your clients and then likewise on the scalability there are certain aspects of that where the greater demand for ill call it just computing power if you will on the part of our large asset manager clients on some of the asset owner clients were just in an environment where theres greater activity and we didnt achieve the level of i would say scalability on our platform that we need to be able to achieve so with each of those three not only are we trying to ensure we have a strong safe stable secure platform but we want to increase the scalability on that so a lot of the focus of our technology strategy beyond kind of digitizing the business and providing new capabilities for our clients is also saying how do we also get greater productivity out of that platform michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 okay thats helpful and just a quick followup tax rate was a little bit lower you guys mentioned some of the drivers jason any like change in terms of the range that you guys typically expect when we think about going forward jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp ill start this quarter had some impact even from indiscernible some other small items none of which in and of themselves worth calling out but i dont think you should expect us to be at this level and we talked i think biff mentioned last time in the call its something in the i do think is a better longerterm assumption at this point michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay thanks a lot michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from rob wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp morning guys on the cis business can you give us an update on what youre seeing in the competitive landscape and on the pricing front and then maybe more broadly when you think about the conversations youre having with clients but those discussions changed in tone or content at all recently and how would you expect them to evolve going forward michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure id be glad to talk about it so there is a tremendous amount of activity in cis broadly and specifically i would say asset servicing and i would say a lot of these changes well certainly they create challenges were very optimistic about the growth opportunities that are out there so if you just give me a minute to run across that i think i can address some of these trends that youre looking for so if we think about asset owners even in the parts of the asset owner space that you might think about as being more stable in just their operating models they have greater needs and greater needs certainly lead to more opportunities for us so if you think about the notforprofit sector healthcare is an area that continues to grow and presents opportunities for us to manage the assets of large healthcare organizations universities where you have endowments and also the foundation space theyve increased the mix on the investment side to greater use of alternatives and as a result they have greater needs for how they manage those portfolios and those managers and thats why weve invested in and are rolling out what we call frontoffice solutions because that gives them the capability to do that if you look in australia for example some of the large superannuation funds not only has that been a great growth opportunity for us over the last decade but likewise youre seeing consolidation within the superannuation northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 complex which again presents changes in the marketplace and opportunities for us and the last thing i would say in the asset owner space is more of the very large sophisticated clients so if you think about the sovereign wealth funds are actually insourcing some of the asset management as opposed to allocating it all out to asset managers what that requires is they may need to have the capabilities to operate as asset managers so they have greater data needs and the nature and timing of what they need is greater and so that provides opportunities for us that drives a lot of the investments that you hear about because its now putting them in a different position and then if i shift to the asset management space we talk a lot about the pressure of the secular trends and we feel that in our asset management business as well but it does create opportunities for us on the asset servicing side because it causes these asset managers to look at every aspect of their business including the operations side and so that presents opportunities for us where theyre looking to outsource more activities now historically as you know thats meant mostly middle office and what we do in ioo we are seeing more of those types of opportunities in the marketplace but there are also some new activities that previously were just largely done inhouse by everybody that theyre now saying why should they do those and should it be part of their outsourcing solution so if you think about the trading side where we have integrated trading solutions thats really an outsource trading service that we would provide to them that enables them to essentially move something thats not core to them and that we can do it better and more efficiently for them and there are other opportunities like that i would also just continue with the asset managers to the alternative space where for years the hedge fund space has presented growth opportunities for us our hedge fund services business continues to grow nicely win large mandates you saw this last year but then also for us in the other parts of the alternative space so thinking private equity infrastructure real estate those are areas where weve had less of a market share or market position there but it presents larger growth opportunities for us going forward so overall a high level of activity and thats why when we talk about the growth were optimistic about the growth and we just want to make sure that were able to bring that on in a scalable way so that we get very profitable growth in the business robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp thats really helpful thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator thank you our next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks couple of questions mike just following up on that last question so you talked comprehensively about a lot of the volumerelated opportunities how about pricing what are you seeing as you continue to expand into all of these new areas northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp sure good point and theres no doubt clients want more for less and that cuts across all parts of that sector there so we look at the fee pressure in the asset servicing business as just ongoing so we dont necessarily see its a repricing cycle per say that starts and then ends and then we dont do anything its ongoing for us and thats part of the organic growth equation so were always netting out the not only if we lose the client or they drop a service but also if theres repricing that happens in order to maintain the client now the other aspect of that which is just a dynamic with that business is because large portions of it are based on the asset levels that pricing is based on the asset levels and so as you see greater appreciation in the market then that does mean yes we get the benefit where the fees go up but thats then when you see greater fee pressure so its terrific for us that the markets are going up it does then create more focus on the parts of the client base to look at their fees and thats why overall what were trying to do is balance that but also broaden these relationships to do more for them so that theyre still very profitable relationships overall vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and as youre trying to build all of these areas and as you said you need the tech capabilities for that is there room to bend the growth rate of that tech spend a little bit or not quite yet michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp we believe that there is mark talked earlier about when we think about our tech spend you have the expense side of it which we focus a lot on here and we talk a lot jasons mentioned the increased amortization costs that come through well the other piece of that is that capex piece that mark mentioned which is the capitalization of those costs happened now they manifest themselves in expenses later and thats an area where not only weve been focused but i think theres much more opportunity when you think about how technology is developed these days to be able to do it in a more cost efficient way i think youre all familiar with agile and other methodologies well were deploying those but its still in the earlier stages that in my mind will produce savings that first hits through more efficient capital spend and then later over time it results in lower amortization vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay one more if i may on the funding side your noninterest bearing deposits did pretty well they actually turned around and grew again in the fourth quarter and conversely your shortterm borrowings have been shrinking over the course of so can you comment on both those have noninterest bearing deposits basically turned and should be drawing or whats your outlook of that and what are you planning to do with shortterm borrowings michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp do you want to start mark northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp yeah on the demand deposits we did see an increase sequentially vivek i dont think that were calling this an inflection point weve talked before over the last several quarters we do have especially i would say on the institutional side fluctuations that occur quartertoquarter with clients either positioning their assets on or off balance sheet depending on what they might be doing with their own capital investing so i dont know that we would call out a specific new trend on demand deposits here starting with what we just saw in the fourth quarter well have to see how that plays out over several quarters and on the shortterm borrowing side i would say there that is a if you look back a year ago three four five quarters ago i would say that some of the discretionary leveraging that we are doing within the treasury area was running at a higher level and now at this point over the last couple of quarters weve kind of had that down at a lower level and that manifests itself both in wholesale deposits on the nonus office line but also in those short term borrowings so its really just a function of the leveraging opportunity to kind of gross up the balance sheet the trade there isnt at the tripping point where we would actually go through with that so weve kind of reduced some of that discretionary leveraging that we do michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah its not to say we wouldnt do it again mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp right michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp just the rate environment today just isnt providing that trade for us operator thank you our next question comes from jeff harte with piper sandler mr harte michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp hi jeff jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co sorry about that can you hear me now michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 so id like to talk about expenses but kind of with the growth you guys can deliver on the top line i tend to think a little more of kind of margins in ph ex items saw kind of our first pretax margin compression in whats been a number of years looking to and given that you need to keep investing and the current rate environment and with kind of organic fee growth is near the bottom end of the kind of range should we expect a return to margin expansion in even with those kind of things facing us michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah ill start before we get to the pretax margin yeah were looking at our expenses relative to our fees and the reason why we do that is just the nature of the expenses and how theyre lined up against the different revenue streams and so theres no question because were focused on positive fee operating leverage thats because were saying we want to bring down that ratio first and on that front again its affected by markets and other things but thats why we focus on the organic part because we want to be able to drive that down then if you go to the pretax margin yes some of that flows through but as you know then it gets much more impacted by whats happening with the other revenues to some extent things like fx and the other income lines but mostly net interest income and were trying to provide what we see in the marketplace as far as deposits and deposits pricing and things like that and quarterbyquarter that gives you some indication of as we know from not only last year but every year its really hard to project interest rates and thats a big factor that drives in it and its also tough at times to predict client deposit activity and that drives in it so thats just saying its not that we arent focused on positive operating leverage as well its just there are more factors that frankly are out of our control and even difficult to forecast to be able to answer a question of like well then is your pretax margin going to go up or down we certainly are aiming for it to go up but there are things that are out of our control jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co so if we think of kind of the interest rate environment holding stable and some of the market stuff like fx trading not really declining these pretax margin kind of expansion is potentially attainable michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah depending on the environment youre right it can make it more difficult or it can give us a tailwind jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co okay and secondly with the preferred issuance and redemption can you just review what kind of we should be thinking about the net impact on preferred dividends ph next year i know theres some weird stuff in the first quarter but then even after that what kind of run rate we should be looking at mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp hi jeff its mark yeah so when you look at if you look back at what our prepared remarks were the new series e will have essentially call it a fivemonth dividend in the first quarter which would be million theres also some costs from series c that we would also need to recognize upon redeeming it in the first quarter so thats million and then we have the series d which you see in the first and third quarter of each year northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 so if you take all that into consideration at this point our expectation is youre probably looking at a preferred dividend right around million million in the first quarter and then in the second quarter you come down to the normal new dividend for series e which is million and that would be the new run rate in the quarter where we dont have the series c hopefully that helps we could talk through it offline if youd like jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co okay no thats great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from brian kleinhanzl with kbw michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp hi brian jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp hi brian brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great hey morning just a quick question on all these expenses i mean you have a normal expense investment that youre doing was the three items that you laid out the pension expense the base pay adjust and the it depreciation included in that growth rate already are you saying that youre investing and then you have to still consider these three additional items that are going to be on top of it mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp portion of it so the base pay adjustments are thats always factored into how we think about our expectations for expense growth the pension is obviously anomalous and thats one that its not forecast and mike mentioned earlier were not ignoring it we still want to do everything we can to get leverage in that and then the depreciation increase weve known that were going be leaning into more it spend in the short run at least and so id say the base pay adjustments fully factored in to our longterm assumptions the pension not but were still working hard to try to even cover that and then the third element of it depreciation and part of thats already in the run rate and so thats the key element there but the increase itself is one we have to own it and weve got to there is a high sense of urgency about making sure we get leverage across each of the key expense items including equipment and software at some point thats going to be difficult to do in the near term given what were trying to do strategically but certainly the ph bpa and a portion of the depreciation reflected in our longterm expectations brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 okay and then separately in the asset management i hear again that the organic growth not kind of where you want it to be i mean at what point do you need to do something bigger with regards to restructuring the unit or taking more strategic actions there thanks michael g ogrady a chairman president chief executive officer northern trust corp i think within the asset management sector that our asset management business is performing very well we talk about the environment a lot just because it is going through secular change but if you just looked at the competitive positioning if you looked at the growth relative to others and then you look at the profitability its performing well and i would say strategically we feel very good about how the business is repositioning itself and what i mean by that is weve been strong and had scale in certain areas like liquidity like index for a long time and what weve been doing over the last few years is repositioning towards some of the higher growth but also more valueadded areas which i talked about so quant esg things like that and so those areas although they represent a smaller portion of the pie if you will they are growing they are resonating but like any longer term strategy it takes time before you see the impact of that from a financial perspective but as far as thinking bigger if you will i would say we are and i just talked about ill call it the product side of that were also looking not looking at but have been executing on the strategy on the distribution side as well and its going well i would say on the institutional side you saw that not only in the fourth quarter but the second half of the year where thats gone well but then you also saw last year that we acquired a business that is very small but which is essentially a technology platform which we are utilizing in the intermediary space and we think again thats the type of capability that will enable us to accelerate the growth rate that we already have within there so yes secular change but we feel very good about our strategic position in there operator thank
