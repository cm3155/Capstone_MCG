growth in our revenue our expenses also increase year overyear albeit at a lower rate as we continue to invest in technology and our staff including higher levels of compensation as we build a diverse engaged workforce with skills for the future taken together this resulted in both positive fee operating leverage as well as positive total operating leverage to close i also want to express my sincere and immense appreciation for our employees around the world whose commitment expertise and professionalism in serving our clients communities and one another continues to be truly extraordinary now let me turn the call to jason to review our financial results in greater detail for the quarter jason j tyler executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thank you mike let me join mark and mike in welcoming you to our third quarter earnings call lets dive into the financial results of the quarter starting on page this morning we reported third quarter net income of million earnings per share were and our return on average common equity was which matches our performance from the prior two quarters you can see some historical market data on the bottom of page recall that a significant portion of our trust fees are based on quarter lag or month lag asset levels and both the sp and eafe local had favorable sequential performance based on those calculations as shown on this page average onemonth and three month libor rates were modestly lower during the quarter lets move to page and review the financial highlights of the third quarter yearoveryear revenue was up and expenses increased net income was up in the sequential comparison revenue was up and expenses were up while net income was up the provision for credit losses reflected a release of million in reserves in the current quarter compared to a release of million in the prior quarter return on average common equity was for the quarter up from a year ago and consistent with the prior quarter assets under custody and administration and assets under custody were both up compared to the prior year and flat on a sequential basis assets under management were trillion and are up from a year ago and also flat on a sequential basis northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 lets look at the results in greater detail starting with revenue on page trust investment and other services fees representing the largest component of our revenue totaled billion and were up from last year and up sequentially foreign exchange trading income was million in the quarter up yearoveryear and down sequentially the yearoveryear growth was driven by higher volumes while the sequential decline was due to lower volumes and lower volatility the remaining components of noninterest income totaled million in the quarter up from one year ago and up sequentially within this securities commissions and trading income was up from the prior year and up sequentially higher levels of interest rate swap activity benefited both the yearoveryear and sequential results while higher core brokerage revenue also benefited the performance versus last year other operating income totaled million and was up from one year ago and up sequentially the increase compared to a year ago was driven by distributions from certain investments in community development projects as well as higher banking and creditrelated fees partially offset by lower miscellaneous income the sequential increase was primarily driven by lower expenses related to visa swap agreements and the higher income from investments in community development projects net interest income which ill discuss in more detail later was million and was up from one year ago and up sequentially lets look at the components of our trust and investment fees on page for our corporate and institutional services business fees totaled million and were up yearoveryear and up sequentially custody and fund administration fees are million and up yearoveryear and up sequentially both the yearover year and sequential increases were driven by favorable markets and new business unfavorable currency translation and lower transaction volumes also impacted the sequential comparison assets under custody and administration for cis clients were trillion at quarterend up yearover year and flat sequentially the yearoveryear growth was primarily driven by favorable markets and new business the sequential performance was driven by new business and favorable markets offset by unfavorable currency translation investment management fees in cis of million were down yearoveryear and up sequentially the yearoveryear performance was driven by higher money market fund fee waivers partially offset by favorable markets and new business the sequential performance was driven by new business and favorable markets fee waivers in cis totaled million in the third quarter essentially unchanged from the prior quarter but up compared to million in the prior year assets under management for cis clients were trillion up yearoveryear and down sequentially the growth from the prior year was driven by favorable markets and client flows the sequential decline was driven by modest unfavorable impacts from markets and currency partially offset by positive net flows securities lending fees were million up yearoveryear and up sequentially average collateral levels were up yearoveryear and up sequentially moving to our wealth management business trust investment and other servicing fees were million and were up compared to the prior year and up from the prior quarter fee waivers in wealth management totaled million in the current quarter compared to million in the prior quarter and million in the prior year across the regions and global family office the yearoveryear growth was driven by favorable markets and new business partially offset by higher fee waivers for the sequential performance the growth within the regions was mainly due to favorable markets as well as slightly lower fee waivers within global family office the sequential growth was primarily due to new business favorable markets and lower fee waivers northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 assets under management for wealth management clients were billion at quarterend up yearover year and essentially flat on a sequential basis the yearoveryear growth was driven by favorable markets and client flows while the sequential performance primarily reflected client flows mainly offset by unfavorable markets moving to page net interest income was million in the quarter and was up from the prior year earning assets averaged billion in the quarter up versus the prior year average deposits were billion and were up versus the prior year while loan balances averaged billion and were up compared to the prior year the net interest margin was in the quarter and was down basis points from a year ago the net interest margin decreased primarily due to lower average interest rates partially offset by the benefits of balance sheet volume and mix on a sequential quarter basis net interest income grew average earning assets and average deposits increased on a sequential basis while average loan balances were up the net interest margin increased basis point sequentially primarily due to changes in balance sheet volume and mix turning to page expenses were billion in the third quarter and were higher than the prior year and up from the prior quarter this quarters results included a million pension settlement charge within the employee benefits expense category while the prior quarter included a pension charge of million also recall that last years results included a million charge relating to account servicing activities excluding these items expenses were up versus the prior year and up sequentially compensation expense totaled million and was up compared to the prior year and was up sequentially the yearoveryear growth was primarily driven by higher cashbased incentive accruals as well as higher salaries the sequential increase was primarily due to higher cashbased incentive accruals excluding the previously mentioned pension settlement charges employee benefits expense was down from a year ago and down sequentially outside services expense was million and was up from a year ago and down from the prior quarter revenue and business volume expenses accounted for approximately threequarters of the yearoveryear growth the remaining yearoveryear growth within the category included higher technical services consulting and data processing related costs reflecting investment in the business as well as the timing of engagements the sequential decline was driven by lower technical services legal services and thirdparty advisor fees partially offset by higher subcustody related costs equipment and software expense of million was up from one year ago and up sequentially both the yearoveryear and sequential increases reflected higher software support and amortization costs occupancy expense of million was up from a year ago and up sequentially higher real estate taxes and building operation costs were the primary drivers of both increases excluding the prior years charge other operating expense of million was down from one year ago and up sequentially the yearoveryear decline was driven by lower miscellaneous expenses and staff related costs partially offset by higher business promotion spend the sequential increase was impacted by higher costs associated with the northern trust sponsored pga golf tournament partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses within the category turning to page our capital ratios remained strong with our common equity tier ratio of under the standardized approach down slightly from the prior quarter our tier leverage ratio was in line with the northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 prior quarter during the quarter we purchased  of common stock at a cost of million we also declared cash dividends of per share totaling million to common stockholders the current environment continues to demonstrate the importance of a strong capital base and liquid balance sheet profile to support our clients needs and we continue to provide our clients with the exceptional service and solution expertise theyve come to expect our competitive positioning across each of our businesses wealth management asset management and asset servicing continues to resonate well in the marketplace and is generating organic growth across each business thank you again for participating in northern trusts third quarter earnings conference call today mike mark and id be happy to answer your questions allen will you please open the line question and answer section operator certainly sir operator instructions and we will take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp good morning glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks good morning thanks very much the first one is question on custody and fund administration fees usually were beating you up in saying why didnt they grow as much as assets but this time you have growth almost kept pace with the growth in assets so i guess the underlying question is whats the nature of the new business that youre adding on hows that average fee compared to the overall average and if theres anything else you could add on in there thatd be great because its interesting thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure well ill start and if mike wants to jump in in looking at whats been added on what was interesting to me is that its a really good blend across geographies and across client channels and so theres been good business thats been onboarded in emea apac but also in north america and then you look at the client channels whether its our traditional institutional investor group iig or our fund services group theres been business thats been onboarded across the board interestingly we dont look that much at kind of the average fee per the assets coming onboard we look much more at what are we doing for those clients and so i think what jumps more to me is how weve been able to continue to build in some of the other ancillary services that were doing for clients things overall like core brokerage and you see fx down mostly because of the summer dynamic but its up nicely over a yearover year mike anything to add michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 i would just add glenn two points one is that with some of the new business that came online during the quarter it was as jason mentioned in north america it was in fund services and specifically fund administration plus other services related to that so think about those as kind of fullservice clients to your point where per dollar of assets is going to be higher so good client wins on that front and then the second thing is that we also get growth through the ill say success and growth of our clients and weve seen that particularly in the alternative assets area where theyve had good flows and good appreciation and that has flowed through to some of the increase in fees that youve seen for us glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi that makes a lot of sense maybe just a quick followup now that you mentioned the alternative world obviously theres a big push and ongoing momentum in the highnetworth individuals increasing their allocations to alts weve seen that in a bunch of the big broker dealers weve seen the alts getting success in distributing their product you had a big wealth management platform can you just talk to us about where youre at in terms of that evolution thanks michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp strategically we see that as its been successful to your point glenn but still is a big opportunity for us across the company so meaning each of our businesses and with each of those i would say we are trying to provide more in the way of services or around that so within asset management our south business is completely focused on providing alternative solutions for our both wealth management clients but also institutional clients certainly within asset servicing i mentioned there a little bit alternative asset managers as you know we have a relatively meaningful business in hedge funds with hedge funds were looking to expand that more to private capital where again we have a strong client base but looking to grow that faster and then also with wealth management if you just look at the asset allocation of our wealth management clients at this point it would indicated that overall their allocation to alternatives should be higher over time and so how can we provide that we have some solutions on our platform in addition to south where they can invest directly in alternative funds but we believe that theres more we can do across the spectrum of clients that we have glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp thanks glenn operator our next question will come from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp good morning steve northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so i just want to start off with a question on organic growth and maybe specific to the wealth management segment some of your peers have been citing that flow rates have been running hot expecting some moderation or normalization in the coming quarters i was hoping you could speak to where organic growth within the wealth segment is running today and what do you believe is a sustainable flow rate for that business longer term michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp well the id head start with separating the regions from gfo and in general over the last several years the gfo business which obviously its people that are less familiar than you are steve that serves the very upper end of our market clients with dedicated family offices and we think that that matches our brand particularly well then weve seen strong growth there on a consistent basis and so within the wealth segment thats where weve seen higher levels and then i think progressively that in general the higher the client base in terms of assets thats where weve done well and so thats been a continued theme for us and as we look yearoveryear theres weve always talked about the fact that wealth will be lower organic growth relative to cis through a cycle but still positive and thats what weve seen even if we look yearoveryear jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp i would just add theres also a tremendous amount of activity right now which difficult to predict how that will continue but when you think about familyowned businesses and other liquidity events for business owners that wealth creation where it goes from a business to being liquid wealth creates the opportunity for us to work with those clients in a different way and so there have been a high level of activity on that front and well see what happens through the end of the year here potential tax changes things like that that generally creates opportunity for us steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc its great and just for my followup on the nii outlook certainly encouraging to see the uptick in securities yields in the quarter and just curious if the forward curve holds have we reached a point where weve lapped reinvestment headwinds and just bigger picture in terms of the nii outlook more broadly given strong loan growth and improving rate backdrop should we expect to now grow off the current nii base level jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so were still were not fully all the way through from an nii perspective the whole balance sheet is call it to through but obviously were not quite all the way there yet from a securities perspective were getting close were still losing id call it based on the reinvestment rates right now about million a quarter in northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 reinvestment but thats going to eventually taper off and its not as big of an impact as it was a year ago obviously just having million quarter drag and so youre right in that from here mostly the drivers are going to be based on whats happening in the business and so you saw a strong loan growth and other factors of where were investing be the key drivers of the movement in nii and the drag from reinvestment is definitely much much lower than what it was before steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color thank you so much for taking my questions jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure thank you steve operator and your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp hey brennan if youre talking youre on mute brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc man its happened to me again sorry about that i like to follow up on stevens question and his point i think is really fair weve seen a pretty significant acceleration from a lot of the wealth management firms and its happening broadly its happening in the mass affluent space its happening in the highnetworth space it doesnt seem like you guys have seen a similar magnitude of acceleration but were not sure because we dont get the granular disclosure so number one could you maybe juxtapose do you juxtapose your growth versus some of those peers and then maybe if the growth hasnt accelerated the way weve seen at some of the others why do you think that is do you think its because you are focused on ultrahigh net worth do you think its has something to do with your approach in how you market to clients where facetoface meetings are a lot more important what do you think might be going on there thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp start mike michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp so ill start and i think to your point our business is different than what i would call the broad market for wealth managers and as weve talked about many times were a more focused upmarket where some of that activity can be lumpier if you will where there are large transactions that either our clients are a part of or large wins where were bringing on new clients with very meaningful wealth and so i think in that sense you are going to have different dynamics that happen there now we do internally track closely the flows and the revenues that are coming in from the different types of clients and as much as northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 theres been some variability in the proportion thats coming from the ultrahigh net worth versus the high net worth its still relatively steady so i would say to your point we are participating in this very kind of broad base whether were participating as much as any one of the other particular competitors i cant speak to but on the higher end it has its own set of dynamics brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that and jason youve recently flagged some upward expense pressure at an industry conference which has been a big focus for investors so i understand that its probably too early to get much of a sense for magnitude on that front but if it is possible to try to frame the magnitude thatd be helpful number one and number two even with that upward pressure is the commitment and the focus still on generating fee revenue operating leverage or organic operating leverage ex the fee waivers jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thanks i dont want to ramble would it be helpful for me to just give a little bit of an overview expenses in general or do you want me to just stay specifically on the on kind of what happen with technology equipment and services outside services brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc no its much more about the outlook and thinking about next year versus whats happened here recently jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so sounds good so we mentioned historically that we think about expenses in four categories theres inflation efficiencies investments and growth so just keep that framework in mind and ill give some of the key themes that were thinking about as were thinking about expenses so first inflation is going to hit in a couple of areas mike talked earlier about the pressures were feeling there in comp were going to see higher growth levels every firm is talking about the challenges of retaining and attracting top talent were no different so this will hit its affecting the salary base now but its going to continue to embed over time and well see a larger than historical adjustment in second quarter when our normal base pay adjustments actually hit it also though it affects incentives and thats already hitting the income statement weve got a theres a higher incentive accrual in third quarter of as were addressing these issues and then secondly as you talked you highlighted kind of the equipment software and outside services lines which i think are we should really talk about those in concert with one another because theres some movement between those lines and we want to were going to continue investing and strengthening the technology foundation given that weve got the digital transformation thats happening in wealth management and everything we want to do to maximize defenses against cyber threats that means equipment software and outside services are going to still continue to be on a higher growth rate relative to the other expense categories now just remember about half of those lines are tied to business growth but were going to see the foundational element of those continue to be invested in the third theme id call out is call it a return to normal and thats going to touch on occupancy and then travel which hits in other operating expenses were going to be on the northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 road more often and thatll hit those that line item and were not going to likely get to precovid levels but by the end of next year thatll be significantly higher and then the last theme is on efficiency actions and we embedded efficiency and productivity targets into our plan every year we made a big push on efficiency this year with the staff actions we took out roles mostly in north america and that drove the savings we talked about of about million were going to continue to push for opportunities across all the expense categories to find efficiencies but those are the big four themes that have been on my mind is in our minds not mine all of our minds as we talk as we start to talk about so hopefully hopefully thats helpful and giving you a little bit of an outlook of how were thinking about expenses brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc it is helpful just the last piece to remind you about is the fee operating leverage like despite this pressure jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yes thanks brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc is that still committed jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thank you so much for reminding me of that because that its that is its super important and i think a lot of people try and think about are northerns expenses going to be flat up it depends we consider ourselves still a growth company we want to drive revenue growth and so that fourth element of the framework i gave in the beginning of those comments around growth if were growing expenses because of that because weve got good revenue growth thats fine thats good and so the key thing we look at when we put all that together what does the operating leverage look like for the company brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks operator and next well go to mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi this follows jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning mike northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning this follows from the last question im not sure you answered that last question maybe that was intentional because youre going to wait so do you think youll have the operating leverage based on fees relative to expenses even with the higher comp te and cyber but the general question is where are you on the broader investing curve i mean head count this year should probably grow only by about and for the prior five years it grew by about thats a dramatic reduction in the number of people that youre adding so it looks like a lot more productivity so the question is how much is that driven from technology and is sustainable and it should help drive positive operating leverage in the future and how much is simply more productive employees who might cost more in the future michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp so mike im going to start with that because youve highlighted i think a really important dynamic which is we have seen this meaningful increase in productivity that said looking at the drivers of that yes some of it is from technology that has enabled us to automate activities and other initiatives that weve been executing on for some time period that said another driver is the tight market for talent and just the remote working environment its changed the operating environment and to your point or question on sustainability my judgment would be that its a little tight its too tight at this point so weve continued to grow as jasons highlighted some of that growth yes comes through the markets but weve also added new clients net new business for us weve added people as a part of that weve tried to do it very efficiently but also its been a heavy burden i would just say on the employees to be able to deliver that in a remote working environment and so back to this broader question on what were driving towards its profitable growth which does mean growing fees growing revenue faster than were growing our expense base with that now at any quarter at any year it can ebb and flow a little bit but thats the objective over time and when we look at the profitability in this quarter whether you want to look at the roe the pretax margin or the fees to expenses theyre all at pretty attractive levels could they be better particularly on the pretax margin if the rate environment changes absolutely and wed like to see that but we think were operating pretty efficiently today certainly look to do more but were in an unusual operating environment mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one related question as far as the investments in your back office which youve retooled as it relates to the cloud i think you are more conservative with your plans to move more workloads to the public cloud and im just curious as to why the more conservatism on your part versus some other financial firms michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp so i would say our cloud strategy is absolutely focused and tailored to our business our client base and so the pace or how itd be characterized mike relative to somebody else could be viewed differently i dont have a problem with that were looking at how does it fit with what were doing given the nature of our client base and what we do for them yes we are highly sensitized to all the potential impacts and risks of a transition like that northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 now with that said we have been very focused first on the private cloud and beyond the fact that thats been a strategy that weve been executing on for years in this past year we completely upgraded the capabilities of the private cloud for us and have many many of our applications and activities in the private cloud as far as public cloud were taking a hybrid cloud approach to that to your point i would say being thoughtful about how we do it and we are still in the earlier stages of the actual transition of applications and activities into the public cloud the strategy is there to continue to do that but in a thoughtful secure stable way for our business and for our clients mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator next well go to gerard cassidy with rbc jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning mike good morning jason hi jason can you give us some color on you had real good loan growth this quarter sequentially just what was driving the loan growth and then also with the balance sheet your average deposits you pointed out grew sequentially but the periodend numbers fell so maybe if you could give us some color on that as well jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure so let me start with loan growth two buckets one is in the personnel side and again in that bucket those can be extremely high net worth clients that want to use our balance sheet to sell for liquidity needs and the reason i highlight that is because it can be very volatile and unpredictable but roughly half of the sequential increase came from that general bucket the second bucket is commercial which was about the other half and thats more stable and thats been in various areas but weve talked about going to our existing clients and doing more of the existing loan types with them but explaining to them that weve got appetite to do more with them and part of our business model not just financial model is to grow with our clients and i think thats one of the things thats driven our loan growth is our clients have been theyve been active and weve told them were happy to participate with them more in those ways and so thats hit on the commercial line and so again i think part of it is the base there has definitely risen but part of it is some components that might be more volatile over time northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 and then on deposit volumes and as you know well because i know you follow this closely that can also just be volatile and weve got our clients who will theyll call us and ask to put not millions but sometimes hundreds of millions or billions of dollars on the balance sheet and so we tend not to look at the deposit at the quarterend balances i do look coming into the quarter and after the quarter how they trend and this quarter didnt look very different in terms of how balance has trended coming in or out so i didnt overread the dynamic that you mentioned of the average versus quarterend gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and then you and your peers have had a strong yearoveryear growth in your fee revenues youve talked about it already on this call can you pull out for us what percentage would you attribute the growth in the custody fees in the wealth management fees that is from market appreciation versus new business or additional flows from clients can you parse through that michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp sure so i can split it lets just start well give yearoveryear and if we think about the cis business theres lets say a good chunk has come from markets call it high mid to highsingle digit and then theres also the organic or net new business and other dynamics would represent the rest and that adds up overall to kind of again mid to highsingle digits but a little bit less call it jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp and thats on total cis trust fees michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah and then on wealth i can do the same type of split for you and a little bit more weighted toward market there which is thats had an impact thats stronger if we look yearoveryear more like type and the organic piece if i add it up also strong but more in the lowsingle digit range on a percentage basis jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp and the waivers are certainly in that mix too michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it all right thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp absolutely jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp thank you operator and your next question will come from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi hi good morning i had a question just a bit more strategic to kick off on how youre thinking about the returns that youre going to be generating from the investments youre making today in the various sleeves and across the globe im just wondering if we think about where we are today versus precovid has the return profile changed much for your incremental investment spend thanks michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah betsy i wouldnt necessarily say that the return profile has changed in many respects what i think has been interesting through the crisis here is that although there was a pause in some of the execution of projects and programs around investments in the initial stages of the pandemic it picked up pretty quickly thereafter and instead of groups all being in one room working together on a digital project they figured out how to do it by webex zoom or teams so in that sense weve continued to make really good progress on investments such as just to give you an example the digitalization of our wealth management business where theres a number of components to that journey as we call it and so that progress has been very good and id say in general to your point on the timing or the profile for the returns on that should be similar to what we would have expected when we started it the one thing i would say is just the characterization or the character if you will of investments in the different businesses i talked earlier in the call about launching new funds in asset management for example so theres meaningful investment that goes into product development and again throughout the last couple years here theyve continued to put out new products and then it takes some time period for those to obviously build aum but then are very profitable over time that profile is very different than asset servicing where a lot of the investment the return youre going to get is near term in the sense of bringing on a large client theres some integration transition costs with that but then once thats up and running essentially youre getting the return for that investment northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 and then finally just wealth management i talked about some additions that weve made not just in the last quarter but could go back and there youre hiring people and teams that are in different parts of the country again it takes a little bit of the time for them to get on and get acclimated but theyre productive relatively quickly as well so we look at all of those when we put together both our longerterm strategic planning but also the annual plan betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just a little more nittygritty im wondering if theres any update on how youre thinking about the reinvesting the expenses that have been associated with the golf tournament is that going to flow through in other types of marketing or is that really get thrown into the bigger bucket of opportunity set and we could see that migrate into other areas of investment not specifically around that sleeve of client that youve been investing in with the golf tournament thanks michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah the way i would characterize it betsy is the golf tournament was a great opportunity for us to build our brand and particularly focused on a certain target market and that was highly successful going forward well continue to invest in the brand so yes some of that investment will go into brand building and marketing however there are also a portion of that to your point will be considered more broadly in the investments were making whether thats in people or technology or other areas to continue to grow that company betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks operator next well go to ken usdin with jefferies michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp hi ken good morning ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hi good morning good morning just jason wondering if you can give us an update on your thoughts around fee waivers from here they look came down a little bit obviously rates moved to touch but not that much just any updated thoughts on where you expect those to sit and visàvis waiting for bigger movements in rates going forward thanks jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp sure a couple thoughts one even though we saw a little creep this quarter fairly larger than what we thought it was actually if you think about it it was driven more by volume and we and mike talked in his opening comments about the fact that money market mutual funds are over billion thats a record for us and so northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 and i think people sometimes forget that were participating in the growth but it also causes higher waivers and so but whats more important is that the overall base of business that we have there is good and so if you add the if you add up the waivers plus what were earning and so you think about the overall capacity that we have at the current volume level its somewhat million to million and thats a strong capacity that we have there now will volumes stay in as rates go up probably maybe not but its nice that weve had good volume growth there and the other thing to remember is it doesnt take a big lift in rates for the sort of waivers to come down and a lot of our aum there is more institutional pricing even our even on the wealth side even the waivers that are associated on the wealth management side are the nature of our client base means they price themselves more like institutions they have to got the purchasing power to have more of an institutional approach and so the fees arent that high and it doesnt take that much more yield to clear those hurdles and start to get back to that capacity level and then if you the other dynamic is that run rate wise were still as we sit today were still a little over billion that held in over the quarterend and the run rate on waivers is right at million a quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah okay great and then second question just coming back to the operating leverage points this year a bit of like easy comp for market levels right driving the huge trust fee growth and then kind of a harder comp for costs off of last years really low base so this year youve got this really wide gap but in absolute revenue and in an absolute cost growth rate that are both above trend so to speak and so i think the reason why the questions come keep coming up about cost growth is next year when presumably we dont get as much of that backend lift from markets alone what happens with the absolute growth of expenses relative to what might be a slower and naturally a slower overall revenue growth rate so how much of this years growth rate was also influenced by just the kind of easy comps from last year so to speak as it helps to think us about like absolute levels of expense growth next year thanks michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah just a perspective on that for you ken is i think youre right i mean we did get a meaningful benefit from the market in the fee growth and that helps that positive operating fee leverage fee operating leverage and the other way that i think about it is what is the absolute level of the expenses to fees and so now for this quarter were at about and that is a much lower level than we have been and thats evidence of this positive fee operating leverage over time and so at that tight level to your point to then say in the next year can you continue to drive that down at that same rate thats why i say it kind of ebbs and flows right but we want to be in that range around that somewhere in there to make sure that we are appropriately investing in the business etcetera but also growing we dont want to squeeze that so much that it impinges on our ability to serve our clients and to grow ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah good perspective on reminding about that expense to trust fees thanks northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yes operator next well go to jim mitchell with seaport research jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp jim jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey just maybe on the balance sheet if i look over the last two quarters securities average security levels have been declining while cash levels have been growing is this you positioning for higher rates or is this theres something else driving that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp something else driving that and its theres a hard line that people see externally between the between cash and securities but theres so many different security types that are actually within the cash and within the securities and on the cost of cash and securities there are some areas where weve strategically gone back and forth into and out of and thats frankly where the change in classification that you see has been driven and so there could be securities that are that have a riskreturn profile that are very similar to one another one of which should be classified as cash and one would be classified as securities and thats strategically where well make some of the kind of portfolio decisions of where we want to be playing based on what were seeing in the marketplace and how we think about the riskreturn characteristics and just in a sentence thats whats been driving that the distinction that you see based on the external reporting classification jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay but can you maybe speak to whether you a believe asset sensitivity increased quarteroverquarter and how much of that central bank cash you think is available to invest when you feel the time is right jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp so plenty of availability from a nonhqla perspective and we from our perspective were not constrained by that we feel weve got plenty of liquidity plenty of buffers to be able to react if we see more opportunities in the marketplace and weve just weve been running the portfolio based on consistent riskreturn characteristics and where we want to be from a liquidity perspective but certainly no constraints and plenty of dry powder whether northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 its from a regulatory perspective or even our own view of what we want to do for more of an economic liquidity perspective for us to be able to put more to work if we see the opportunity to do so jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay and the asset sensitivity question jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah weve actually stepped out a little bit one way to get it that just to give you a more of a quantitative weve stepped out about in duration and there are other ways we can say again jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc securities jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp for the securities portfolio thank you thats not the overall balance sheet but the securities portfolio but it gives you a sense of how we manage thats from last quarter and there are other things we can do even within that to provide more flexibility if we see opportunities coming on the yield curve but havent done we havent done much strategically there to change asset sensitivity jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats all helpful thank you jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp you bet operator all right next we go to brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp hey brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 thanks good morning folks hey good morning most of my questions have been asked and answered but i do have two more one sorry if i missed this but the growth in cis sic cis investment management linked quarter up with money market waivers being flat what was the main driver of that mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp hi brian its mark so youre looking at the sequential growth in cis investment management fees brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes mark m bette a senior vice president directorinvestor relations northern trust corp just to make sure yes so yeah it was a combination of both markets and organic growth and to jasons point we did have with the higher money fund level even though waivers go up that does come with fees with net new fees and that would have been partly behind that but if you were going to break it down id say that the new business or organic growth i would say drove a little bit more than the market growth did on that sequential growth brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay okay perfect and that actually is a good dovetail into my second question a little bit broader but esg asset management i think last time i saw it i think you guys were billion correct me if im wrong on that on northern trust esg aum maybe just the question i guess would be from the organic growth side of your investment management business and as you think of that coming both from the institutional side and then especially on the wealth management side how are you viewing that first of all is it important to your wealth management clients to have this capability investment management capabilities and i think mike you mentioned the launch of six new products in the quarter but then also the organic growth potential for northern trust investment management from developing those esg capabilities is that going to be a major driver going forward michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp so brian i would say that that is another major trend obviously thats in the marketplace but also big driver for our strategy going forward yes across the company but as youve highlighted particularly within asset management and at that billion in aum now the growth rate over the last five years there has been about double of what the market growth rate has been for esg best we can measure it there and to your point this hits across our client spectrum so a lot of that it started more outside the us in emea where we initially saw that the greatest growth with institutional clients but now were seeing it more through funds in the us and with both institutional clients but also with our wealth clients and we think were still in the early days we think that that esg or sustainability investing will be at a higher growth rate than the rest of the market overall northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp and the billion number is still ballpark good number in aum brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and the plan is to develop even more product there or do you think youre fairly set where you are michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp oh no definitely more product brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah yeah okay great michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp a lot of it is leveraging this esg vector score that was developed which gives us a lot of capability to do more brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great great thanks for the color thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator all right next question comes from the line of rob wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning guys a question on capital allocation youve been very transparent on the components of your overall capital allocation strategy ratio relative to peers paying dividends supporting growth et cetera any change in your outlook on any of those components that could impact the capital return trajectory going forward michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp thanks for reminding the framework for everyone but the key element there that has been a driver has been weve been able to see the rwa growth because weve seen loan growth coming and its a big factor in how things get driven and there are other things too we could see from securities lending and other components of rwa and at this point we dont see the same type of rwa lift northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 now its not to say that it cant happen and if it does happen and if we see it then well then look at the other factors and determine where we want to be from a cet1 perspective in other areas but as we sit today we dont see the type of organic growth coming in rwa thats the one component of that overall mosaic i would highlight robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research got it thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator all right next well go to alex blostein with goldman sachs michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp hi alex alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning thanks hey guys thanks for squeezing me in so i had a question around the money market fund business youve had quite a lot of success growing that business in aum and really gaining share against a large sort of book of inflows that the whole industry has seen how sticky do you think those assets are going to be in light of tapering hopefully near term but also sort of longer term as we start to contemplate interest rate increases i think weve all sort of gotten accustomed to thinking about all right deposits will probably start to leave the industry but how intertwined do you think the money market fund business is with that as we sort of contemplate how much of fee waivers could ultimately come back michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp ill start alex and then jason who knows that business well can give his perspective but i think whats interesting is coming into the pandemic a couple of years ago you had a combination of two things one is the obvious which youre pointing out which is just significant easing on the part of the central banks increased liquidity and that absolutely drove the flows into the money market funds is one place but the other dynamic is that was also at a point in time where strategically ntam was expanding its distribution for money funds and so not only having a portal but being on other portals and so it was an intentional strategy that hit at the right time to essentially capture more a greater share of the increased flows coming from the additional liquidity in the marketplace so then if you take that and then try to answer your question of what happens to the extent that you have tapering and some contraction there i think yes of course youre going to see it go down but i think its going to be stickier than you might think in the sense of it wasnt just the one factor alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it yeah thats helpful because the share gain dynamic definitely helped there my followup is sort of related to that sorry to go back to the operating leverage dynamic again but mike i appreciate you framing it the way northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 you did is like look were doing to expenses to total fees thats kind of where we hope to be as we contemplate fee waivers coming back should i think of the expenses to fees going below which i guess would imply almost all the fee waiver benefit will come through the bottom line at margin or to is kind of where you see yourself living even with a normalization in sort of interest rates thanks michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah so kiddingly if you could also tell me what equity market levels are going to be at that point in time that would help as well because but youre highlighting the right thing alex that were benefiting now from strong markets with regard to that ratio and were being penalized if you will by this the money market fund fee waivers and so thats playing out in there but i would say more importantly to your question is yes thats going to ebb and flow but i dont believe that that is a ratio that just continues to grind down below zero and well below zero etcetera because i think that that would actually again that would impact our ability to have the right talent make sure that theyre compensated appropriately and fairly for all the value that theyre delivering to invest in the technology to take care of our clients but also to grow the business so simplistically it would be a draw on the business if you tried to squeeze it too tight so to speak so thats why my own view is that that range is more importantly more important now that said i that is not the only ratio that drives overall profitability and returns as you know and right now with rates where they are and net interest margin where it is the other revenues so to speak which are a bigger driver in driving the pretax margin are at a lower level than they have been and so point being you can be in that range and yet have the other revenues growing in such a way that your profitability is going up and your returns are going up alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it yes that all makes perfect sense thanks very much michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator all right well take another question well go to vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions couple of them firstly balance sheet given the plans for tapering your average deposits have been gradually going up what do you see as the outlook for that given the tapering thing that i just mentioned do you see yourself being able to continue to grow that jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 well i think its hard to tell i think our clients right now see the flat yield curve and ive been saying its i think its less about the very short end of the curve and in some ways that has more to do with the shape of the curve and if theres some lift in the medium then i think thats more than anything else would what might cause clients to move off of the overnight effectively to try and get some yield right now with rates flat so far out theres just no enticement to do anything else another dynamic is that some clients think about cash as an asset allocation and equity we were just talking about that the equity markets have done well and so with markets now where they are and everyone seeing their overall portfolio so much stronger we should also assume clients are going to want to have more allocation to cash and so i think both of those dynamics need to be played through as we think through but we certainly think that the things mike talked about with the money market mutual funds and the strength of our balance sheet are things that do attract clients to think that its a good place for us to be able to provide liquidity resource for them vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks a separate question for both of you what are you seeing in the alts space in terms of pricing theres pricing compression overall that all of you talk about in the custody business but specifically alts which has always had a higher fee rate do you see that coming down more than the overall fee rate pricing do you see more compression there given that its higher or any thoughts and color on that michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp vivek are you speaking to the investment product side of it jason j tyler a executive vice president chief financial officer northern trust corp yeah vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc no to the custody business michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp to the asset business vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc the cis business mike michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah okay northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thinking more from that perspective michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc both hedge funds and the private side especially with new players like you getting in as you mentioned trying to grow that more what how do you see that dynamic playing out michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp yeah i would say that particularly on the hedge fund administration side of it some of that has already played through in previous years and so like it would be similar then to other asset classes on the private capital side so pe and infrastructure and real estate and things like that to your point its earlier in the development of that market more of it i think will be outsourced over time and the size of the funds obviously are increasing and so just from a pure rate perspective yes i do think that that will play out in more compression on that if you will than in some of the other asset classes vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp sure operator all right we have one more question and well take that from jeff harte with piper sandler jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co good morning michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp good morning jeff jeffery j harte q analyst piper sandler co hey hey good morning guys so pretty much everything has been asked but the one i had left is there anything to highlight on the sequential increase in nonaccrual loans in the quarter northern trust corp ntrs corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2021 michael g ogrady a chairman president and chief executive officer northern trust corp no that did tick up its more episodic we dont feel like were going to have losses there and weve obviously the reserves are very very strong given the quality of our portfolio but nothing to highlight there that jumped out at us as a concern jeffery j
