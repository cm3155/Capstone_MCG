management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases first quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jennifer piepszak ms piepszak please go ahead jennifer a piepszak chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you operator good morning everyone ill take you through the presentation which as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of included in these results are two significant items billion of net credit reserve releases which ill cover in more detail shortly and a million contribution to the firms foundation in the form of equity investments touching on a few highlights we saw another strong quarter in cib in fact net income was an alltime record with ib fees up yearonyear reflecting continued robust activity and markets up yearonyear as the environment remained favorable in january and february although it did start to normalize in march in awm we had record net longterm inflows of billion this quarter and deposits of trillion were up yearonyear and sequentially as the fed balance sheet continues to expand but loan growth remains muted up yearonyear and quarteronquarter with the bright spots being awm and secured lending in cib on to page for more detail on our results when looking at this quarters performance theres a lot of noise in the yearonyear comparisons particularly given what happened in march of last year and so its important to remember a few key points here about march of effectively investment banking activity stopped or got delayed except for investmentgrade debt issuance we recorded million of losses in credit adjustments and other in cib as well as a million markdown on our bridge book and in credit we built billion of reserves relative to this quarters release of billion so with that in mind revenue of billion was up billion or yearonyear net interest income was down billion or primarily driven by lower rates noninterest revenue was up billion or while this comparison is in part impacted by several of the items i just mentioned in absolute terms we saw strong fee generation across the franchise including in investment banking awm and home lending as well as a strong performance in markets expenses of billion were up yearonyear on higher volume and revenuerelated expenses the contribution to the foundation that i just mentioned as well as continued investments and credit costs were a net benefit of billion driven by reserve releases and here its worth noting that chargeoffs were down about million yearonyear or and continue to trend near historical lows jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 turning to page for more detail on our reserves we released approximately billion of reserves this quarter as recent economic data has been consistently positive indicating that the recovery may be accelerating faster than we wouldve thought just a few months ago starting with consumer in card we released billion as the employment picture has continued to improve the round three stimulus has provided another level of support and earlystage delinquencies remained very low and in home lending we released million primarily driven by continued improvement in hpi expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio runoff and then in wholesale we released approximately million while a strong recovery seems in motion were also prepared for more adverse outcomes given remaining uncertainties around the impact of new virus strains and the health of the underlying labor markets so for now we remain cautious and are still weighted to our downside scenarios and at about billion were reserved at approximately billion above the current base case however its worth noting that even in a more normalized environment we wouldnt expect to be weighted to the base case as well always have some weighting on alternative scenarios now moving to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of flat versus the prior quarter as net growth in retained earnings was offset by lower aoci and higher rwa perhaps the more interesting ratio right now is slr which is at excluding the temporary relief that just expired as we said all along we were never going to rely on shortterm temporary relief as a longterm planning matter and this is evidenced by actions weve taken weve already engaged with our wholesale deposit clients to explore solutions and we issued billion of preferred stock in the first quarter having said that its worth reinforcing a few points here first its important to remember that the slr is a leveragebased requirement not a riskbased requirement the growth in bank leverage has been driven by deposits and therefore cannot be cured by reducing lending in fact the opposite would be true if we had more loan growth it would help because it would absorb excess riskbased capital the issue is that weve had muted loan demand todate and even if it starts to pick up its hard to envision that organic loan growth could keep pace with further qe and therefore we expect this leverage issue to persist for some time and finally when a bank is leverage constrained this lowers the marginal value of any deposit regardless if it is wholesale or retail operational or nonoperational and regulators should consider whether requiring banks to hold additional capital for further deposit growth is the right outcome as we told you last quarter we have levers to manage slr and we will however raising capital against deposits andor turning away deposits are unnatural actions for banks and cannot be good for the system in the long run and then just to wrap up on capital regarding distribution the limitations were extended another quarter so based on our income that corresponds to buyback capacity of about billion in the second quarter after paying our dividend given the preferreds we plan to issue and the work under way around excess client deposits while of course this could become more challenging we believe that we should be able to buyback most if not all of that capacity now lets go to our businesses starting with consumer community banking on page ccb reported net income of billion including reserve releases of billion starting with the key drivers of yearonyear financial performance which ill just note have generally been consistent over the last few quarters against a backdrop of strong consumer balance sheets with higher savings rates and investments as well as healthy de leveraging jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 deposit growth was or billion as existing customers balances remain elevated and we also continue to acquire new customers client investment assets were up driven by market appreciation and positive net flows across our advisor and digital channels home lending originations were billion up in an overall larger market and auto loan and lease originations were billion up with march being the best month on record however loans were down as outstandings in card remain lower even as spend is recovering to precovid levels this is in addition to the continued runoff of the mortgage portfolio and partially offset by ppp addition mobile users grew to nearly million and the customer migration to digital continued with branch transactions still down doubledigits in consumer banking approximately of new checking and savings accounts were opened digitally and thats up more than percentage points yearonyear notably were also seeing a few emerging trends worth covering consumer sentiment has returned to more normalized levels reflecting increased optimism weve seen debit and credit card spend return to prepandemic levels up yearonyear and versus 1q19 despite te remaining significantly lower that said we are seeing strong momentum in te with spend up more than in march compared to february and similar growth across cxloyalty and ultimate rewards travel bookings with higher rates mortgage lock margins have tightened and refi applications have slowed but the overall market is still robust and on credit government stimulus and industry forbearance programs have provided confidence that the bridge is likely going to be long enough and strong enough taken together with the pace of the vaccine rollout we believe theres some permanence to the loss mitigation and while 1q21 card losses are higher quarteronquarter we do expect losses to decrease in the second and third quarters in summary revenue of billion was down yearonyear driven by deposit margin compression and lower card nii on lower balances largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher home lending production revenue expenses of billion were down as we selffund our investments and credit costs were a net benefit of billion driven by the billion of reserve releases i previously mentioned partially offset by net chargeoffs of billion now turning to the corporate investment bank on page cib reported net income of billion and an roe of on record first quarter revenue of billion investment banking revenue of billion was up yearonyear excluding the impact of the bridge book markdown last year ib fees of billion were up and while we now rank number two largely due to spac ipos we maintained our global ib wallet share of the quarters performance was an alltime record driven by the continued momentum in the equity issuance markets as well as robust activity in ma and dcm in advisory we were up benefiting from a surge in announcement activity in the second half of debt underwriting fees were up driven by leveraged finance activity and here we maintained our number one rank and lead left position and in equity underwriting fees were up more than primarily driven by ipos as clients continued to take advantage of strong market conditions looking forward the ipo calendar is expected to remain active with ma momentum likely to continue and while the pipeline is higher than its ever been the number of flow deals outside of the pipeline both this year and last year make it difficult to predict the second quarter so at this point id say we expect ib fees to be about flat year onyear jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 moving to markets total revenue was billion up against a strong prioryear quarter in january and february we saw a robust trading environment and client activity remained elevated with the positive momentum from the end of carrying through to the start of the year in march our performance started to normalize but remained above precovid levels fixed income was up with outperformance in securitized products and credit supported by active primary and secondary markets partially offset by lower revenues in rates and currency emerging markets against the tough compare in march of last year equity markets was up and an alltime record driven by a favorable trading environment in equity derivatives as well as strong client activity across products in terms of outlook based on recent weeks we would expect this quarter to be closer to the second quarter of as 2q20 was the best quarter on record for our markets franchise but obviously its still early wholesale payments and securities services revenues were billion and billion respectively both down yearonyear with higher deposit balances more than offset by deposit margin compression expenses of billion were up yearonyear on higher revenuerelated compensation partially offset by lower legal expense and credit costs were a net benefit of million driven by the reserve releases i discussed earlier now lets go to commercial banking on page commercial banking reported net income of billion and an roe of revenue of billion was up yearonyear with higher lending and investment banking revenue in the absence of a prioryear markdown in the bridge book partially offset by lower deposit revenue record gross investment banking revenue of billion was up with broadbased strength as market conditions remain favorable expenses of million were down driven by lower structural expenses deposits of billion were up yearonyear and quarteronquarter as client balances remain elevated and loans were down year onyear and sequentially ci loans were down from the prior quarter on lower revolver balances as clients continue to access capital markets for liquidity partially offset by additional ppp funding and cre loans were down with continued low origination volumes in commercial term lending partially offset by increased affordable housing activity finally credit costs were a net benefit of million driven by reserve releases with net chargeoffs of million driven by oil and gas now on to asset wealth management on page asset wealth management generated record net income of billion with pretax margin of and roe of for the quarter revenue of billion was up yearonyear as higher management fees growth in deposit and loan balances as well as investment valuation gains were partially offset by deposit margin compression expenses of billion were up with higher volume and revenuerelated expenses partially offset by lower structural expense and credit costs were a net benefit of million primarily due to reserve releases for the quarter record net longterm inflows of billion were again positive across all channels asset classes and regions with particular strength in equities and in liquidity we saw net inflows of billion as banks encouraged clients to move excess deposits away from them aum of trillion and overall client assets of trillion up and yearonyear respectively were driven by higher market levels as well as strong net inflows and finally deposits were up and loans were up with strength in securitiesbased lending custom lending and mortgages jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 now on to corporate on page corporate reported a net loss of million revenue was a loss of million down million yearonyear net interest income was down nearly million on lower rates as well as limited deployment opportunities on the back of continued deposit growth and expenses of million were up million yearonyear primarily driven by the contribution to the foundation i mentioned earlier the results for the quarter also include a tax benefit related to the impact of the firms expected full year tax rate relative to the level of pretax income this quarter so with that moving to the outlook on page youll see here that our nii outlook of around billion remains in line with our previous guidance as the benefits of the steepening yield curve are being offset by customer behavior in card its worth noting that forecasting nii is perhaps more challenging than its been in a long time as many of the key inputs marketimplied rates deposit forecasts securities reinvestment and customer behavior in card are all quite fluid and as a reminder while customer deleveraging and higher payment rates in card is a headwind for nii its a tailwind for credit and we now expect our card net chargeoff rate to be around basis points for the year and then on expenses we increased our guidance to approximately billion with the largest driver being higher volume and revenuerelated expenses which importantly have offsets in revenue so to wrap up the year has gotten off to a strong start and a robust economic recovery seems underway of course there are still risks and uncertainties ahead that were preparing for as well as specific issues that were facing including the balance sheet dynamics i mentioned the rate environment and tough yearonyear comparisons among other things having said that the earnings power of the franchise remains evident and well continue to use our resources to serve our clients customers and communities and with that operator please open the line for qa jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america merrill lynch jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning my first question is for jamie jamie you noted during a december conference that you believe that normalized rotce for jpmorgan would be about and investors are wondering as we think about jpmorgan perhaps cementing a higher gsib surcharge at this year is still achievable under that context or constraint jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co go ahead jenn jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so erika ill start so just a couple of things to think about on capital so while we ended the year in the bucket for gsib and its probably worth mentioning given the continued expansion of the system through the fed balance sheet even staying in could become challenging for us but just a couple of things to keep in mind there is we believe that we do have offsets in the stress capital buffer and we do believe that its very possible that well see those come through in this round of course its dependent upon the fed models not our models but weve talked about things that actions that weve taken sort of mechanical in nature in addition to moving investment securities into heldtomaturity that should give us some benefit on the scb of course thats scenariodependent but we do expect some benefit there that could offset its also important to remember that we still are waiting for the basel iii endgame and the indication from the fed is that they will address gsib recalibration as part of that and so its quite possible that we see gsib recalibration but perhaps another constraint that well be managing so there is a lot that well learn over probably the next year or two and of course the higher gsib doesnt come into effect until the first quarter of so we do think we have offsets were still thinking about as being a target cet1 for us of course given what we know today but we are still waiting for that basel iii endgame to really understand what were dealing with and at that in a more normalized environment which wouldnt just be about rates it would also be about loan demand still feels achievable for us jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and thank you for going through some of the leverage constraint now that slr has been exemption has expired the investors have also been wondering as we think about your opportunity to continue to facilitate the economic recovery globally does the constraint on slr and the moving pieces on gsib change your priorities in terms of timing or sizing of the billion buyback or inorganic growth opportunities that youve mentioned in the past jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i would say broadly speaking no but an important point there on slr we obviously the levers we have are issuing preferreds we can retain more common but were also working closely with wholesale clients in a very selective way as i mentioned to find alternatives for excess deposits so it is true that common is one of the levers although i will say that while it might give us more flexibility it comes at a much greater cost so at this point given what we know and what we expect we dont expect that we would have to retain more common we think we can manage this through issuing more preferreds and working closely with our clients to find alternatives so i would say broadly speaking no the gsib constraint as weve been saying for years now is one that will become increasingly challenging for us and now particularly with the expansion of the system its even more challenging than perhaps it was just a few years ago but were managing through that as well operator your next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hey good morning jenn i wanted to ask about expenses obviously youve raised the outlook by billion a few times the last couple times youve spoken i guess in terms of the increase that you announced today to the outlook could you give a little more color on how much of that is volume and revenuerelated as opposed to the other buckets you talked about in january which were investments and structural jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure sure so the increase from the billion which was the guidance we gave in the 10k is almost entirely volume and revenuerelated and so there ill just make an important point that its volume and revenuerelated so as an example volumes in ccb just given the environment they are very valuable for longterm franchise revenue growth but we may not see that revenue growth in the near term but as we always say we dont manage this place for one quarter or even one year so there are expenses associated with volume growth that may not have the revenue growth you would anticipate over the long run but its almost entirely volume and revenuerelated there are a few other things like marketing jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 expense that given the strength of the recovery that we expect we now expect to lean more in on marketing expense in the second half of the year so thats part of it as well john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and i guess the followup would be is that necessarily mean that its more concentrated the increase in the first quarter because you had such a big quarter and are there covidrelated costs that you have in your numbers this year that might come out over time jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co obviously some of it is in the first quarter but things like further volumerelated expenses like i talked about or marketing theyre less so in the first quarter and then what was your other question jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co covid jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co covid oh those numbers are lower than they were even last year and included in the outlook but not material in the grand scheme of things operator your next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hello there so if youre right on the economy which i think a lot of us think you are were starting to see the spend part of the pickup now as you mentioned across credit and debit and some of the te so my question is how do you think about the staging of the lend part both consumer and corporate are so flush with all that liquidity how do you think about the timing for loan growth and if i could get a consumer versus wholesale comment that would be great jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so you used the right word which is demand and it really is all about demand which of course is quite healthy particularly as it relates to the consumer when you think about the amount of deleveraging that weve seen through this process so there we do expect a second half pickup because as you say we first have to see spend recover before we see relevering on the consumer side and then it is also true even for small business which is obviously part of ccb there demand has been very low given the support thats available through ppp and so that will likely pick up in the second half as well jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 and then elsewhere awm has been strong throughout and we see that continuing and then on the cib side thats always lumpy and deal dependent but thats active as well and we do see within secured lending opportunities there across asset classes again thats a bit more opportunistic and then in the commercial bank given the level of support the amount of liquidity in the markets as well as the amount of cash on balance sheets loan growth there has been muted and probably will be for some time but again thats incredibly healthy ultimately for the recovery and so whether we see that pick up later this year or next year remains to be seen but its all for good reasons glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc i appreciate that maybe ill just ask one followup on the deposit side obviously deposit growth has been incredibly strong so the twoparter is what do you think happens on the deposit side as the economy goes down the path that youve outlined and what do you do with the deposit money in the meantime because i saw loud and clear jamies comments on its hard to justify the price of us debt so what are we doing with all that liquidity in the meantime jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so first of all i would say that deposits are going to be driven by the fed balance sheet and to some extent obviously by bank lending but given the demand picture there you can think of it in the near term as all being driven by fed balance sheet expansion and so we obviously continue to expect significant deposit growth which is why weve been talking about this so much and then just in terms of how we deploy it you will have seen that our cash balances are up quarteroverquarter and there its just important to remember that for sure we are being patient in the investment securities portfolio that is true ill also mention that because of the steepening of the yield curve we are less short banks will drift long in a selloff and so that has been part of the dynamic as well but theres shortterm cash deployment also and so what we saw there was when repo markets fall below ioer were going to hold that shortterm cash deployment in ioer relative to the repo market so youll see that dynamic on our balance sheet as well operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey jenn thanks good morning just wondered if you could elaborate on that you mentioned the record investment banking pipeline and flattish yearoveryear as a best guess i was just wondering if you could talk about the mix dynamics there obviously the first quarter was just ridiculously great in terms of the ecm markets and can you just give us a flavor of where you see activity and how much is that underwriting activity potentially dampening what might be happening on the commercial loan side jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 well ill start with the latter which is its absolutely been very very supportive of corporates and therefore it has a lot to do with what were seeing in terms of the muted loan demand from corporates and then in terms of the mix we expect ecm and ma to continue but on dcm theres a lot of slow activity that doesnt necessarily get represented in a pipeline because its highvelocity type activity we saw that in the second quarter of last year we continue to see that now which is why i said it makes it a little bit difficult to predict the second quarter so while the pipeline is higher than its ever been there is still a lot of highvelocity activity and so thats why we think the quarter will be flattish yearoveryear despite the very high pipeline jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co can you guys hear me jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co because we cant hear you anymore jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co oh jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co im going to put you on mute for a minute jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay jamies traveling so we have him on zoom i know everybody can appreciate technology challenges because weve all had them over the last year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great jenn and my followup is jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 hey jenn just keep on going because i cant hear the questions i cant hear you but youre doing a great job and you dont really need me jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co well thank you im sure ill need you at some point so hope theyre on that anyway go ahead im sorry ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah no problem jenn so the second one is just with regards to the comments that you guys have made for a while about looking at acquisition opportunities just wondering how is the interplay between everything youve talked about already on balance sheet capacity and ongoing deposit growth and limitations on cet1 and slr versus how you make potential decisions around usage of capital in an acquisition capacity jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah its a great question interestingly the issue is not that we dont have capital available to make those types of decisions the issue is that we have the wrong binding constraint so the binding constraint is leverage not riskbased and so it doesnt change the way we think about acquisitions at all in fact acquisitions andor increased loan growth would help to kind of normalize the constraints between leverage and riskbased and so we would love to be able to absorb some of our cet1 through acquisitions because as i said it sort of just brings the balance back into focus the issue is that its a leveragebased constraint that is the constraint and were in a low rate environment with low loan demand and very strong deposit growth so its the combination of all those things that makes leverage the binding constraint but it doesnt change the way were thinking about acquisitions operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey jenn hey thanks for the time jenn a question on card and looking at the net chargeoff you gave us the full year of and i know youve spent a lot of time in card earlier in your career so maybe you could give us some sense on how youre thinking about the normalization of that loss content over time when i think back to the bankruptcy changes in the 2000s it took many years for consumers to relever and im wondering given your background there could you give us a sense as to what is different this time and are there time frames historically we should look at for what a normal course like releveraging back to normal of that card loss content should be how do you think about that jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 sure i would say first of all its difficult to find a historical comparison thats totally relevant here because i dont think weve ever seen this amount of support in the system which came of course on top of an already reasonably healthy consumer so its difficult to find the historical perspective but i will say the i mean precovid we would have thought that our loss rate in card this year would have been so it just gives you a sense there that tailwind on credit is significant and in terms of what its going to take for consumers to relever we do expect there to be significant economic activity in the second half and so that could come quite naturally but it could come a little bit later given the amount of deleveraging weve seen but the fact that we already see spend above precovid levels and obviously we still have restrictions in place particularly around te on consumers ability to spend when that comes back we do think that well see spend tick even higher and that will be a point where perhaps well start to see that relevering but it is difficult to know its a great question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then the followup i have on your comments around the nii guide and the fact that its hard to forecast i got a couple of questions in this morning just on hey why do you think its flat versus prior guide given the curve has steepened and also deposit growth should continue to be up significantly given qes continuing this full year so is there some spread angle that youre kind of thinking about that keeps you a little bit more muted is it more the loan growth maybe you could talk a little bit about those piece parts that you identified jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure i think its probably all the above betsy but starting with the steepening of the yield curve so if you look at the earningsatrisk disclosure we did see the benefit roughly in line with what that disclosure shows which is since we last guided on nii we steepened probably basis points so that is incorporated in the outlook but it is completely offset by the fact that we continue to see consumer behavior in card in terms of higher payment rates and we havent started to see relevering as we were just talking about even though spend has recovered so card the impacts of card completely offset the steepening of the yield curve you also mentioned loan growth which is critically important to realizing the benefits of the steepening yield curve and then i would just mention we have reflected in our outlook the fact that we have been patient on deploying further deposit growth into the securities portfolio in terms of duration and then also its probably worth noting that the marginal benefit of further deposit growth is quite small given the fact that deployment opportunities are minimal and so you can think about them as being something less than basis points because we do have pay rate above zero so its something less than basis points so the marginal deposit growth from here doesnt add a whole lot in this environment anyway operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 hey jennifer my questions for jamie and jamie your philosophy is to invest through a downturn and youre increasing your investments by onefourth yearoveryear you already said that but whats your philosophy about investing through a boom as you expect over the next three years if the pie is growing do your investments go higher it looks like thats not the case with the guidance you guys gave jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i think mike the way to really look at it is it isnt affected as much by boom or bust as you think so we isolate opportunities like for we announced were going to hire black financial advisors were going to do that whether its boom or bust were building new data centers were building new agile were going into the cloud so i think it doesnt really change that much over time i just think youll probably see our investments go up over time not go down because we have plenty of organic growth opportunities which we want to invest in mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then how much are you spending in climate your 66pages ceo letter could be a third of a book almost but you really pound the table on climate risk and what you guys need to do how much are you actually spending and whats the payback on that spending for shareholders or is this really an esg reputational benefit youre looking for jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so ill start there mike and then jamie you can chime in but climate is a long game obviously and were investing a lot of effort in our esg initiatives not only because they have a positive impact on society and communities but because theyre also important to our clients customers and our shareholders so we dont exactly think about it that way mike but weve also invested in multiple teams to help clients through the transition and we do recognize its a transition and clients appreciate that weve also made the parisaligned financing commitment last year and were going to release our annual esg report next month so youll see more there and then we also committed to finance billion towards climate action and sustainable development and were continuing to grow those efforts as well and in fact your questions quite timely because were planning to make an ambitious announcement tomorrow about longterm scaling of our financing efforts here so much more detail to come shortly on that but jamie i dont know if you want to add anything jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co indiscernible operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co good morning james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc just maybe a question on the bank slr which i think was a bit more of a constraint even than the firmwide slr just i guess two questions related to that what kind of flexibility do you have to kind of manage the difference between the two moving assets out of the bank perhaps and then if you have any updates or thoughts on potential changes that regulators are discussing to kind of give maybe relief in a more permanent sense on the slr jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so the bank slr broadly speaking its going to be the same levers we do have a little bit more flexibility as you note because we can move things we can inject capital into the bank from the holding company so its a little bit more flexible but generally speaking the constraints and the levers are the same and then in terms of changes we know what you know and so we look forward to a proposal the only thing i can mention is of course the difference between the us and europe on basel as it relates to slr is there its plus half of your gsib and so we have a constant buffer and with that you get the flexibility in a basel complaint way to exclude deposits at central banks for a period of time so its possible that it could look something like that but we dont know james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thanks jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co can i just point out on slr i think theres a little too much focus on this we run the business we do a great job servicing clients over time we manage or probably god knows how many different capital liquidity constraints we have multiple levers to pull all the time to do that while serving our clients if we got to adjust our strategy going forward so be it well probably be fine i think the question you should be asking isnt what it means for us is what it means for the marketplace ive already mentioned several times we have trillion of cash and marketable securities which we cannot deploy in a whole bunch of different ways intermediating in the marketplace whether its repo or just financing positions or helping people because of these constraints so the constraints are more of a constraint on the economy than they are on jpmorgan chase we will find a way regardless of any constraints to do things the other thing is gsifi slr there are all these multiple things they need to be recalibrated and i think people should be asking how would you recalibrate it and do the best job for the united states and the people of the united states not for jpmorgan jpmorgan will be fine either way jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 james mitchell q analyst seaport

you addressed this i had to jump off for a minute here but can you share with us the mortgage servicing business it looked like you had a small loss this quarter similar to the fourth quarter can you tell us some of the metrics that went into why the servicing business recorded a small loss jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co oh gosh gerard im not even sure but reggie and his team can follow up with you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay very good and then the second question has to do with when we go back to the day one loan loss reserves established in january for you and your peers under cecl accounting if i recall i think your loan loss reserves to total loans at the time were approximately today theyre approximately i know you guys gave some color on your outlook for what you think credit will look like youre being a little more conservative but can you share with us what would it take to bring the reserves back down to the day one levels that we saw in january jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co well its very difficult to try to compare today to just taking our balance sheet today taking the profile of our portfolio today and compare it to cecl dayone because we are very far away from that in fact in a very healthy way so thats very difficult to do jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 what i will say is that it is true that things have continued to improve even since we closed our process in the first quarter and we obviously expect things to be we expect the recovery to be robust in the second half of the year and so if we continue to see that if we continue to see labor markets recover if we continue to see the vaccine rollout be successful we would have future releases from here but i would note importantly that the billion that is the distance between our reserve and the base case is just for context we will always have weightings on alternative scenarios and so all else equal which theres a lot in the all else equal bucket but we would release something less than billion so difficult to compare back to cecl dayone but there could be further releases ahead jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co one of the negatives of cecl which i pointed out right from the beginning is we spend a lot of time on these calls describing something which is virtually irrelevant for the bank which is these are multiple scenarios hypothetical probabilitybased and obviously the more volatile the environment the more volatile these numbers if a base case was billion and we now have something like billion were not going to be taking down a lot of reserves now because youre always as jenn said youre always going to have an extreme adverse case think of it kind of like a ccar test and you always have a percentage of reserves up for that permanently and so hopefully my view is we should waste a lot less time on cecl it makes almost no difference to the company in general jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and then back on your servicing point i got the answer its updates to the msr model so hpi updates prepay updates so its less about the operation and more about the msr model update operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i wanted to ask about the ceo letter where there was talk about being open to fintech deals which is something youve talked about in the past but what type of deals would you be interested in and i guess could they be material to jpmorgan as we think about whether its your strategy or financial impact jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so remember after paying a steady careful dividend and stuff like that you might prefer to invest in our business organically including the acquisitions than buying back stock were buying back stock because our cup runneth over we have capital to advanced riskweighted assets and were earning a tremendous sum of money and we really have no option right now jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 but i think the doors open to anything that makes sense so weve already done instamed which is an electronic digital payments platform between providers and consumers in healthcare we did 55ip which is a taxefficient way of managing money and were looking at tons of things ourselves some were building ourselves like dynamo some were going to partner with other people weve got investments in probably different companies at this point that we either partner with or aligned so were completely openminded it could be payments it could be asset management it could be adjacencies it could be data it could be anything like that it cannot be a us bank so were just reminding people if youve got great ideas for us let us know matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and is the mentality in fintech specifically is it to potentially accelerate from the investments that you would have done on your own or to add capabilities or maybe protect what you already have jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well its a little of everything because you see us adding chase my plan and chase my loan and obviously competing a little bit with buy now pay later you see us doing chase offers to compete with people you see us doing zelle payments and weve got tons of fabulous stuff coming we did you invest a couple years ago it had a very good quarter were adding roboinvesting which is just getting going so were adding a broad set of capabilities across the full spectrum and youre going to see a lot more youre going to see personalization of apps and if you go into the payment system youre going to see global wallets youre going to see tons of stuff thats coming and like i said the fintech has done a great job i pointed out that they live under different constraints but theyve done a great job getting rid of pain points making things automated digitizing things using the cloud its incumbent upon us to go fast to the cloud we already have major ai projects but my guess is in five years itll be ai projects so were going as fast as we can to do a great job for customers and obviously fintech will be a challenge theres a lot of money there theyre very smart people i want to be clear were not wishing regulations on them like on us i think that would be bad for america but we are wishing for a level playing field when it comes around certain products and certain services i for one think its grossly unfair that a neobank can have a small checking account and earn in durbin fees and we earn that just isnt right and i can go on and on and on about some of the unfair things but look let the regulators do it im not expecting any change we will just adjust our strategies accordingly operator your next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi brian jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning i just have a quick question as we start to look out to forward rates and market kind of implying fed moving somewhat in the near term or intermediate term how are you guys thinking about deposit betas this cycle and kind of whats included in your nii sensitivity both on the consumer and commercial deposits thanks jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so i think the way to answer that is the betas have gamma meaning they change over time and we have our best guess in the number that jenn gives you so obviously the betas going up all the time and then it levels off jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thats right and so the betas have gamma like id say that you can think of it as being nonlinear meaning the beta for the first basis points will be lower than the beta for the second and third increments of basis points and so from here on the retail side specifically the first basis points will be very valuable because there is a lower beta associated with it so thats really where we see the benefit in nii with short rates in an environment with low loan growth operator your next question comes from the line of charles peabody with portales partners jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hello operator hi mr peabody your line is open please ensure that you do not have your line on mute charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc hello jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hello go ahead charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc can you hear me now jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes we can hear you go ahead charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc sorry about that i had a question about the impact that negative rates at the short end of the yield curve might have on your entity specifically you touched a little bit on the ioer rate and the overnight repo rate being raised would that have any impact on your marketrelated nii if they had to raise by basis points secondly if we do get negative rates at the short end is that incorporated into your billion nii guidance and then thirdly if we do get negative rates at the short end does that have any implications for what loan demand might look like thank you jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so ill just start by saying while we have seen repo go negative at times its been orderly and so we dont expect short rates to be negative for any longer period of time and we certainly havent seen spikes which is something you would worry about more i think with the amount of capacity in the money market complex and the fact that the feds increased their rrp facility now that facility is at zero so that certainly is supportive of ensuring short rates dont go negative for any meaningful period of time they also obviously could increase that and then for us i would say not a meaningful impact because obviously we have basis points of ioer as an option for us but we do trade around it jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i would just add the why is far more important than the number like nii obviously like in trading it goes in and out but all things being equal no it just shows up in a different place but if you go negative nii because youre going back into a recession because theres a negative variant thats a whole different issue than if its a temporary timing thing i would tell you we would expect rates to be moving up over time and we expect a rather healthy very strong economy jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes and what weve seen so far on the short end is not unhealthy or something were worried about its a dynamic of so much cash chasing the supply charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of andrew lim with société générale jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi andrew andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi jenn jamie good morning so just circling back to the slr despite issuing billion preferreds you still lost about of basis points on your slr im just wondering how you think about the ratio two three quarters out from now whether issuing preferreds and having your discussions with wholesale depositors is going to be enough to put a floor on that slr at or whether youre going to have to pull harder than that on those levers or have to pull harder on other levers jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so the minimum is so we have some room naturally we will have a buffer above the minimum as you always need to when you have binary consequences of going below so you can think about some management buffer above that but we do still have room at and we do think that we can manage this at this point through issuing well be in the market again with preferreds as well as the conversations that weve had with clients so far they have not been disruptive were hopeful that that remains the case and that we can manage this andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk okay so whats your level of comfort for the buffer above the that was my followon and then just another question you gave an update a couple of quarters ago saying that you had a buffer of or lets say excess provisions of about billion versus your base case scenario economic outlook obviously youve released quite a lot of provisions since then can you give an update on what that figure is now jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so you can think about a buffer on the slr of call it basis points it is important to note something like aoci is something that we have to incorporate into our thinking and the impact of aoci as thats part of tier capital so we need to have a buffer to make sure that we can manage through any noise we might see there so thats why we have a buffer and basis points is probably a reasonable one to think about on reserves the distance between where we are and the base case as i said in my prepared remarks thats now billion whats interesting to note is that that was billion it was then billion and weve released billion and its still billion so all of the scenarios have been moving and theres a lot that goes into how we think about reserves weve always just provided that as context for everyone particularly last year as we were managing through so much uncertainty in terms of the inputs into our reserves so i wouldnt put a lot of weight into that because what i also said on the billion is that you shouldnt think about that as available for release because we will always have some weighting on alternative scenarios and so even if everything plays out exactly as we expect based upon where we closed the books for the first quarter it would be something less than billion jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi im still wrestling with the deposit conundrum so i guess your national deposit share is something like and over the last year i think your incremental deposit share gain is in other words the industry deposits are up around trillion and your deposits are up around billion so im just wondering how much of that was due to qe and how much of that is due to organic growth and maybe you can fill us in because youre building out the branches in the lower states and youre expanding commercial bankers and trying to build up all this organic growth at a time when you cant really monetize those deposits thanks jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so first of all as we always say were running the place for the longterm and we dont expect this challenge to be a longterm challenge maybe a shorttomediumterm but not a longterm and then ill just say that yes there was certainly some organic growth but it is fed balance sheet and bank lending that create deposits and so thats what we are focused on and we do think given what we expect here that we can manage it and it certainly isnt going to change the way we think about market expansion or otherwise as that is longterm franchise value indiscernible jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co hey mike of the billion and its really hard to do that we think were growing actual share in almost every business deposit but billion to billion was the fed balance sheet and were a big wholesale bank and a big consumer bank so obviously a big portion in that shows up inside our company and again the new branches are doing great but theyre not going to move the needle quite like the fed adding trillion of deposits in the system jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thats right mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just the quick update on the buildout into the lower states branches you said by the middle of this year jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes so well be in all lower by the end of july is that right yeah reggie is confirming for me we will be in all lower by the end of july we opened about branches in market expansion last year we got a little bit jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 slowed down by covid but thats going to be about this year so remain super excited about that and all the mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co opportunities that it brings across the company not just in deposits of course because it brings incredible value to the commercial bank and to the private bank and so the business case there if you will is not just about deposits operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america merrill lynch jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi erika again erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi apologies for prolonging the call i just got this question a lot on bloomberg from investors just wanted to re ask the first question another way it seems like we have been waiting for recalibration on the gsib for some time now on the other hand clearly the expansion of your balance sheet comes with additional revenue generation and market share taking in some opportunities and so investors are wondering if we dont get any sort of calibration thats meaningful and that cet1 floor does have to move up from what is the sensitivity of the normalized rotce outlook if any at all if that does have to move up in 50basis point increments jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay so if the has to move up erika that would obviously have an impact but there is so much between here and there and that being a reality that we cant really comment on it because not only i know weve been waiting for gsib recalibration for a long time but it has been made very clear that gsib recalibration will be part of the basel iii endgame which we have also been waiting for for a very long time and so there will be potential offsets that were unable to manage because we dont know what they are yet so we continue to wait for basel iii endgame and then as i said we do believe we can manage the stress capital buffer again its scenariodependent but we do believe we can manage that to be closer to which helps an awful lot in terms of an offset to gsib constraints so were thinking about that number until we know something different jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2021 and ill just add were going to fight like hell to keep the and were pretty sure we can do it so im not that worried about it but i dont know what the confusion is if it did go up by if were earning tangible equity and our capital goes up by and we get no return on the our roe goes to so i dont understand the confusion the underlying results are still fabulous and great and yes slightly lower returns but i think it will be temporary we will over time find strategies and tactics to get returns that are fair to our shareholders but most importantly about those returns we have great business great branches great products great services good margins good service good ops good controls and thats what we really build all the time and this other stuff is just managing around capital constraints its a shame that this is this is not the way to run a railroad anymore were spending time on this call on cecl and slr and its a shame and it does distract from growing the american economy ive mentioned over and over we have trillion deposits trillion loans trillion of cash and marketable securities much of which cannot be deployed to intermediate or lend how conservative do you want to get erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch no i agree i think the market needed to hear that thank you jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you operator there are no
