management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases first quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jennifer piepszak ms piepszak please go ahead jennifer a piepszak chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you operator good morning everyone as you heard jamie is with me on the call and i know i speak for the entire company when i say we are just thrilled that hes back before we get into the first quarter performance we want to start by recognizing that this is an extremely challenging time for all of us and our thoughts are with those most affected by covid19 particularly those on the front lines of this crisis the presentation this quarter is slightly longer to address a few key topics as we navigate this environment and as always its available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back starting on page id like to highlight some of the ways were responding to covid19 as a firm we are focused on being there for our employees customers clients and communities in what is an unprecedented and uncertain environment and while we dont know how this will play out we will be transparent here about our assumptions and what we know today our number one priority is to continue to provide our services in an uninterrupted way while also providing a safe work environment for our employees were incredibly proud of all that our firm has been able to do over the past few weeks so ill just hit on a few examples here weve mobilized our workforce around the globe to work remotely where feasible including operations and finance teams portfolio and risk managers bankers and traders ensuring they have the right tools to work effectively currently we have about working from home across the company and for many groups that number is well north of and for those who still need to go into the office or into a branch we are taking extra precautions and being extremely mindful of their safety and were providing assistance in other ways too for instance were offering free covidrelated medical treatment for us employees and their dependents on the consumer side approximately three quarters of our branches have been open all with heightened safety procedures and many with drivethrough options and the vast majority of our over atms remain accessible and while our call center capacity has been challenged weve clearly activated resiliency plans to address customer calls seeking assistance and we put in place new digital and selfservice solutions in record time and while wait times have been extended were making good progress reducing them for our customers who are struggling financially during this time we are providing relief such as a 90day grace period for mortgage auto and card payments as well as waiving or refunding certain fees we continue to support our customers and clients by providing liquidity and advice during this challenging market environment and in the month of march we extended more than billion of new credit jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 in wholesale clients drew more than billion on their revolvers with us and we approved over billion of new credit extensions for clients most impacted and for our small business clients were actively supporting the sbas paycheck protection program the numbers you see on the slide are as of april and as of this morning we have more than in some stage of the application process representing billion in loans and we funded billion to businesses with over employees and to help the most vulnerable and hardest hit communities as an initial step weve announced million loan program to get capital to underserved small businesses and nonprofits as well as million philanthropic investment now turning to page for highlights on our first quarter financial performance for the quarter the firm reported net income of billion eps of and revenue of billion with a return on tangible common equity of while the underlying business fundamentals this quarter performed very well we reported a number of significant items all due to impacts from covid19 which ill discuss in more detail later but at a high level these items are a credit reserve build of billion approximately million of losses in cib largely due to the widening of funding spreads on derivatives and a million markdown on our bridge book it might be an obvious point but the quarter was really a tale of two cities january and february and then march when the crisis started to unfold and with that i thought it would be helpful to talk through some key metrics that highlight this dynamic across our businesses so lets go to page starting with card sales volume on the top left in march we saw a rapid decline in spend initially in travel and entertainment which then spread to restaurants and retail as social distancing protocols were implemented more broadly while most spend categories were ultimately impacted we did see an initial boost to supermarkets wholesale clubs and discount stores as people stocked up on provisions but even that is now starting to normalize and we saw similar trends in merchant services as highlighted in the significant decline in brickandmortar spend excluding supermarkets whereas ecommerce spend has held up well by comparison in investment banking in the middle of the page there was a surge in debt issuance by investment grade clients as the market remained open and clients desire to shore up liquidity was top of mind it was the largest quarter ever in terms of investment grade debt issuance led by jp morgan and in markets volatility drove elevated trading volumes across products most notably across rates and commodities which at their peak were more than triple our average january trading volumes and on the far right deposit growth accelerated meaningfully in march most notably driven by wholesale clients as they secured liquidity and held those higher cash balances with us at the same time we saw accelerating loan growth primarily driven by revolver draws and finally flows in awm were meaningfully different in march compared to january and february longterm flows through february were strong positive across all asset classes but this was more than offset by outflows in march on the flip side we saw significant net liquidity inflows into our government funds during march which more than offset prime money market outflows onto page and some more detail about our first quarter results revenue of billion was down million or yearonyear as net interest income was flat to the prior year due to the impact of lower rates offset by jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 balance sheet growth and mix and higher cib markets nii and noninterest revenue was down driven by the significant items i already mentioned which were largely offset by higher cib markets revenue expenses of billion were up driven by higher volume in revenuerelated expenses continued investments and higher legal expense all of which were largely offset by structural expense efficiencies this quarter credit costs were billion including a net reserve build of billion reflecting the impacts of covid and net chargeoffs of billion in line with prior expectations now turning to page we have some more detail on the reserve builds our net reserve build of billion for the quarter consists of billion in consumer predominantly card and billion in wholesale with builds primarily due to impacts of covid19 as well as lower oil prices this reserve increase assumes in the second quarter that us gdp is down approximately and the unemployment rate rises above followed by a solid recovery over the second half of the year in addition to these macro assumptions specific to each business our consumer reserve build reflects our best estimate of the impact of payment relief that we are providing to our customers as well as the federal governments stimulus programs and in wholesale the majority of the build is in sectors most directly impacted by covid19 such as in consumer and retail and also in oil and gas we expect other sectors to be impacted to a lesser extent if we avoid a prolonged downturn we have also assumed that the stress in oil and gas continues with wti remaining below through the end of after we close the books for the quarter our economists updated their outlook which now reflects a more significant deterioration in us gdp and unemployment if that scenario were to hold we would be building in the second quarter and builds could be meaningfully higher in aggregate over the next several quarters relative to what we took in the first quarter a primary unknown is the duration of the crisis which will directly impact losses across our portfolios with that being said our consumer portfolio skews more prime than the industry average and the effectiveness of government support customer relief and enhanced unemployment benefits while uncertain undoubtedly will act as mitigants to the losses and so even though our losses will be material we will be doing what we can to help our customers recover from this crisis and help our clients stay in business now moving to balance sheet and capital on page our balance sheet capital and liquidity going into this crisis were incredibly strong and importantly allowed us to facilitate client needs in a period of stress and that combined with our earnings power is an extraordinary base to absorb the inevitable losses to come for the quarter we distributed billion of capital to shareholders which includes billion in net share repurchases up to march since then we stopped our buybacks which was both a prudent decision at the time and consistent with what we always say which is that we would prefer to use our capital to serve our customers and clients this capital distribution outweighed our earnings for the quarter and this coupled with significant rwa growth resulted in a decline in our cet1 ratio to on rwa which you can see on the bottom right on the page the key drivers of growth were market volatility which should subside over time and more importantly an increase in lending at this critical time for our clients going forward in order to leverage our balance sheet to serve our clients we are prepared to use our internal buffers which may mean our cet1 ratio falls below our target range and if necessary we can also use jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 regulatory buffers to go below our minimum its worth noting here that an environment like this is precisely why we have the buffers in the first place we currently also have capacity and intend to continue to pay the dividend pending board approval and as you can see in the cet1 walk on the bottom left it is a small claim on our capital base and before we move on just a moment on liquidity even with everything we facilitated our liquidity position remains strong and looking forward its helpful to remember that we have significant liquidity resources beyond hqla including the discount window if need be and now turning to the businesses starting with consumer community banking on page ccb reported net income of million including reserve builds of billion january and february showed a continuation of strength across the business but again march showed a major shift in trends and across our consumer segments we saw a drastic deceleration in spend across all forms of payments and a decline in origination volumes except in the mortgage refi market and on the small business side we saw significantly reduced inflows in merchant processing activity early signs of pressure on payment and delinquency rates as well as line utilization and increased demand for credit turning back to the results revenue of billion was down yearonyear in consumer business banking revenue was down driven by deposit margin compression partially offset by strong deposit growth of that accelerated in the quarter deposit margin was down basis points yearon year and we expect it to decline further given the current rate environment home lending revenue was down driven by lower net servicing revenue and lower nii partially offset by higher net production revenue and in card auto revenue was up driven by higher card nii on loan growth and margin expansion average card loan growth was with sales up over the quarter driven by january and february activity expenses of billion were up driven by revenuerelated costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business partially offset by structural expense efficiencies and lastly on this slide credit costs included the billion reserve build i mentioned earlier and net chargeoffs of billion driven by card and consistent with prior expectations now turning to the corporate investment bank on page cib reported net income of billion and a roe of on revenue of billion investment banking in the first half of the quarter showed continued momentum from last year but as the market environment shifted we saw delays in ma announcements and completions postponements of new equity issuance and increased draws on existing lines of credit at the same time the investment grade debt market remained open and we helped our investment grade clients raise approximately billion of debt in the quarter across a wide range of sectors by contrast the high yield market was effectively closed and high yield spreads widened significantly as a result our bridge book commitments were marked down by million and here its worth noting our bridge book exposure is about a quarter of what it was entering the crisis and is a higher quality portfolio as a result of this backdrop ib revenue of million was down yearonyear largely driven by the bridge book markdowns jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 ib fees were up yearonyear and we maintained our number rank with wallet share advisory was down not only due to a tough compare but also reflecting delays in regulatory approvals pushing out the closing of certain large deals we did however complete more deals than any other bank this quarter equity underwriting was up versus a challenged first quarter last year and we saw strong activity in january and february before the market effectively closed in march and debt underwriting was up and an alltime record we maintained our number rank with share up basis points from lending revenue was up yearonyear driven by the impact of spread widening on loan hedges looking forward while a rapid recovery in the economy could produce a corresponding rebound in activity we could also see significant downside risk to our forwardlooking pipeline if the downturn is protracted now moving to markets here total revenue was billion up yearonyear its worth noting that even before the crisis as we said at investor day markets performance was strong for the quarter then the growing covid19 concerns triggered a major correction in equity markets significant widening of spreads and a spike in volatility leading to extraordinary government intervention and a substantial change in monetary policy followed by a sharp decline in treasury yields simultaneously we also saw a drop in oil prices this unique combination of events led to further increased client participation and record trading volumes in several products fixed income was up driven by strong client activity most notably in rates and currencies and emerging markets equity markets was up on strength in equity derivatives driven by increased client activity in terms of outlook it goes without saying that its too early to project this performance going forward in fact low rates and low economic activity may even be a headwind however we are in a strong position to continue playing an essential role in ensuring the orderly functioning of markets and serving our clients needs and now onto wholesale payments a new business unit were reporting this quarter comprised of treasury services trade finance and the merchant services business which was previously part of ccb wholesale payments revenue of billion was down yearonyear driven by a reporting reclassification in merchant services as clients focused on preserving liquidity we experienced higher deposit levels in wholesale payments throughout the quarter offsetting revenue headwinds from lower rates and payments activity in securities services revenue was billion up yearonyear market volatility drove increased transaction volumes and deposit balances which offset the impact of the market correction on asset balances in wholesale payments and securities services tailwinds from this quarter like elevated deposit balances may be relatively shortlived and more than offset by the impact of low rates and potentially lower transaction volumes if the crisis is elongated credit adjustments other was a loss of million which was one of the significant items that i mentioned upfront credit costs were billion driven by the net reserve builds i referred to earlier and finally expenses of billion were up driven by higher legal and volumerelated expenses and continued investments now moving on to commercial banking on page commercial banking reported net income of million including reserve builds of approximately million revenue of billion was down yearonyear with lower deposit nii on lower rates and a million markdown in the bridge book partially offset by higher deposit balances gross investment banking revenues were million down yearonyear compared to a record prior year while we remain confident in our longterm target we expect some softness in our pipeline specifically related to ma and equity underwriting jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 expenses of million were up yearonyear consistent with the ongoing investments we discussed at investor day deposits were up yearonyear on a spot basis and increased about billion during the month of march with about half of that coming from clients drawing on their credit lines and holding their cash with us as they look to secure liquidity endofperiod loans were up yearonyear mainly driven by increases in ci loans in march ci loans were up as revolver utilization increased to which is an alltime high cre loans were up and here the story remains largely unchanged higher originations in commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment were partially offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective credit costs of billion included the reserve builds i mentioned and million of net chargeoffs largely driven by oil and gas now on to asset wealth management on page asset wealth management reported net income of million with pretax margin of and roe of revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher management fees on higher average market levels and net inflows over the past year and then in addition we saw record brokerage activity in march related to the recent market volatility these increases were largely offset by lower investment valuations expenses of billion were flat yearonyear with higher investments in the business as well as increased volume and revenue related expenses offset by lower structural expenses credit costs were million driven by reserve builds from the impact of covid19 as well as loan growth net longterm outflows were billion as the strength we saw in january and february was more than offset in march at the same time we saw billion of net liquidity inflows driven by significant inflows into our industryleading government funds in march as i mentioned earlier aum of trillion and overall client assets of trillion up and respectively were driven by cumulative net inflows partially offset by lower market levels deposits were up yearonyear on growth and interest bearing products and finally loan balances were up with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending now on to corporate on page corporate reported a net loss of million revenue was million a decline of million yearonyear primarily due to lower net interest income on lower rates partially offset by higher net gains on investment securities expenses of million were down million yearonyear and now lets turn to page for the outlook at investor day we showed you a path to where we expected net interest income to be slightly down from and obviously since then the backdrop has changed significantly based on the latest implieds and what we know today we expect to see further pressure from rates partially offset by balance sheet growth in cib markets nii which results in nii of about billion for the full year and to give you an idea for the second quarter we expect nii to be billion on noninterest revenue its always difficult to provide meaningful guidance and even more so given the current heightened level of uncertainty but based on our best estimates today we do expect to see headwinds in compared to in addition to the two significant items in the first quarter these headwinds include a billion decrease in noninterest revenue all else equal which is also due to the impact of rates and is the offset to higher cib markets nii and therefore revenue neutral we also expect to see pressure on awm and investment banking fees and we now expect adjusted expenses for to be approximately billion largely due to lower volume and revenuerelated expenses versus the jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 outlook we provided at investor day it goes without saying all of this is market dependent and well keep you updated at future earnings calls so to wrap up the challenges we are all facing as the covid19 crisis continues to unfold around the globe are unprecedented although we dont quite know what the path will look like going forward what we do know is that we will continue to be there for our employees clients customers and communities as we always have been and we have the talent resources and operational resiliency to do so our employees have proven that being resilient is not just about maintaining operations its also about culture and that feels stronger than ever with our teams around the world working harder than ever to continue to serve our clients customers and communities we have never been more proud of our people and we simply cant thank them enough and with that operator please open the line for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question comes from erika najarian from bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning and jamie were glad that you could join us and that youre well enough to join us my first question is on the forbearance activity jenn if you could give us a sense of by product how many of your clients for example in card auto home lending are in a forbearance state so they started to defer the payments for the percentage of your clients and how we should think about the significant government intervention relative to the severely adverse scenarios i believe for total losses its over nine quarters for the fed and for companyrun jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so first of all ill start with the payment relief and forbearance there i would start by saying that we have already refunded millions of dollars in fees weve approved payment relief for hundreds of thousands of accounts across consumer lending and we obviously expect that to be meaningfully higher through time we paused foreclosures and auto repossessions and importantly weve made the process easier for our customers through digital and selfservice options that we built in record time but in terms of what were seeing those are the numbers theyre still as i said relatively small compared to what we think well ultimately see in mortgage just to give you context outside of customers asking for forbearance which is just a little over of our service book at this time the april payments seems bau in card were seeing payment rates down a bit but still strong and weve seen a slight uptick in late payments in auto but the quality of these portfolios was strong coming in as weve done surgical risk management over the last few years and that has made these portfolios more resilient and then in terms of how we think about a significant government intervention i think the ultimate effectiveness of these programs which are extraordinary in terms of the direct payment or the enhanced unemployment insurance the ultimate effectiveness is i think the biggest unknown the key obviously is being able to bridge jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 people back to employment and so we have assumed as best we could for our first quarter results the impact of those programs as well as the ultimate impact on payment relief that well be providing to our customers but that is for sure an unknown and we certainly expect to learn a lot more about that in the second quarter erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you my second question you mentioned that youre prepared to go below cet1 to help your clients going below is also when the automatic restrictions start kicking in from the fed in terms of payouts so if i understand it it would be a payout restriction on eligible net income and just wanted to understand your thoughts on balancing servicing your clients and also thinking about your capital levels relative to those automatic restrictions from the regulators jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so as you probably know erika the fed made some changes there recently which as you say puts us in a bucket as we go below and we have a reasonable amount of room below to remain in the bucket i would say that that was very helpful clarification from the regulators in terms of how we should think about using regulatory buffers so that was particularly helpful and right now we are focused on serving clients and customers and weve looked at a range of scenarios so we can ensure that were managing our capital quite carefully jamie talked about an extreme adverse scenario in his chairmans letter that we looked at assuming large parts of the economy remain in lockdown through the end of this year and in that scenario our cet1 drops to about and so we think we have significant room to continue to serve our customers and clients through this crisis but we are managing it ph quite proactively and looking at a range of scenarios so we make sure that were prepared operator our next question is from mike mayo of wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi and welcome back jamie the question is for you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co hi mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc how do you thread the needle between supporting your customers and the country and doing all those things that you want to do while still protecting the resiliency of the balance sheet and not getting hit with unexpected litigation costs as you mentioned in your ceo letter jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah no that is a very important question and i think in times of need banks have always been the lender of last resort for their customers and obviously youve got to be a disciplined capital provider because undisciplined jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 loans are bad so you take a calculated risk were making additional loans were adults we know that if the economy gets worse well bear additional loss but we do forecast all that so we are we know we can handle really really adverse consequences there will be a point and the last question brought it up was where if you get below cet1 even though well have almost billion of capital and trillion of liquidity all these other constraints start to kick in like slr gsifi advanced risk weighted assets that may kind of constrain it and then obviously then you got to look forward so we want to do our job if we can help the country get through this everybody is better off if we lose a little bit more money in the meantime so be it but obviously were going to protect our company our balance sheet our growth and well be having close conversations with regulators about what that is i also think you have to take in consideration the extraordinary measures the government has taken thats the income to individuals ppp and all these federal reserve things mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so also in your ceo letter you talk about the economy coming back online and i guess with your reserve build youre assuming what unemployment and then the economy improves in the second half of the year so what is your base case for how people come back to work thats behind those ph assumptions and i know you have a lot of scenarios too but just a base case jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah ill let jenn talk about the base case but i think the back to work we shouldnt think of it as a binary thing that after the cdc and we all get instructions from the government after theres enough capacity in the hospitals after theres proper amount of testing remember a lot of people are going to work today in farms factories food production retail pharmacies hospitals it isnt like no one is going to work and hopefully you can turn it back on where its very safe theres plenty of capacity youre not worried that you cant give every american who does get sick the best possible medical advice and the turn on would be regional by company all following standards and best health practices and in some ways you need to get that done because the bad economy has very adverse consequences way beyond just the economy in terms of mental health domestic abuse substance abuse et cetera so a rational plan to get back to work is a good thing to do and hopefully it will be sooner rather than later but it wont be may were talking about june july august something like that so i dont know if that answers your whole question oh and then jenn can you give the base case on jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so mike as we close the books for the first quarter just to give it context we were looking at an economic outlook that had gdp down in the second quarter and unemployment above its just important to note that that kind of gives you a frame of how to think about it but theres a lot more that goes in to our reserving including management judgment of some world class risk management and finance people and also other analytics jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 and so that just kind of gives you a frame of reference but there we did think about a number of other scenarios that we should contemplate in reserving and we also thought about the impact whats our best estimate of the impact of these extraordinary government programs as well as our own payment relief programs since then as i noted in my prepared remarks our economists have updated their outlook and now have gdp down in the second quarter and unemployment at thats obviously materially different both scenarios though do include a recovery in the back half of the year and so all else equal and of course the one thing probably the only thing we know for sure mike is that all else wont be equal when we close the books for the second quarter but all else equal given the deteriorated macroeconomic outlook we would expect to build reserves in the second quarter but again a lot will depend on the ultimate effect of these extraordinary programs and how effective they can be in bridging people back to employment and were going to still have a number of unknowns i would say at the end of the second quarter but were going to learn a lot through these next few months that will inform our judgment for second quarter reserves operator our next question is from steven chubak of wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning and jamie nice to have you back so wanted to ask a question on some of the remarks relating to capital quarles actually made some comments on friday alluding to efforts by the fed to incorporate reallife covid stress in the upcoming ccar cycle we havent gotten much color since then im wondering whether you received any guidance from the fed on which changes if any they plan on contemplating for this years test and maybe just bigger picture how are you thinking about the potential impact that could have on the scb and potentially raise some of your capital requirements jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure thanks steven so we havent gotten specific guidance but it certainly makes sense that the fed would want to look at a scenario like that we have been as you might imagine staying very close to our regulators through this crisis so they can have a very good understanding of how we are managing things and then in terms of the potential impact well learn more about that in june weve given our best estimate of scb and the impact it will have on our minimums and that is absolutely incorporated into our thinking about how well manage capital through a range of scenarios here but well learn more from the fed in june steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay just one follow jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and then i would just add ive always pointed out the flaw doing one stress test which will not be the stress you go through jpmorgan does a week and were always looking at potential outcomes and obviously were doing our own covidrelated type of stress testing including extreme and well always be updating them and talking to regulators about it because thats what we have to deal with at this time not what you all would consider a traditional stress test jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah we steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and just one jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co have both a the range of outcomes probably have never been broader and so as jamie said we have ccar has been a good place for us to start in terms of one scenario but we have looked at a number of different scenarios at how this may play out and obviously jamie articulated what we think could be an extreme adverse and were prepared for that too so i think the most important thing is that were prepared for a range of outcomes and well learn more about scb in june steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and just a follow up on the securities book just given some of the significant declines at the long end of the curve jenn i was hoping you could help us think about where reinvestment levels are today just compared with the yield on the blended securities book and then just separately given the large impact of qedriven deposit growth how youre deploying some of that excess liquidity in this environment jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so on the investment securities portfolio managing the balance sheet in this rate environment is obviously a different dynamic and with lower rates as well as the deposit growth that you mentioned audio gap with the fed balance sheet expansion you do see a large increase in our investment securities portfolio this quarter which makes a lot of sense right now in terms of balance sheet management we are completely focused on supporting client activity our balance sheet is harder to predict right now but we are prepared for a range of outcomes steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay thanks very much operator our next question comes from saul martinez of ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning wanted to follow up on the ceclrelated question jenn you gave us a good amount of color on what the underlying economic assumptions that were used to build the reserves and where the risk has been and your economics team is now for the second quarter but maybe thinking about it a little bit differently in terms of how to attribute the cecl reserve build and im not looking for specific numbers more just directional jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 how do we think about it in terms of how much is attributed to sort of mechanistic modelrelated changes where you calibrate your model for new economic scenario versus actual signs of stress that youre seeing in your book that maybe arent showing up in credit measures but that you do think will show up in a reasonably short time period call it within the next few quarters how much of its growth how much of its mix just if you can talk to that because i guess what im trying to get at is how much of its more mechanistic and how much of its actual tangible signs that youre seeing that financial stress in your borrower base that could emerge in the reasonably near future as credit losses jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so its a great question saul so i would start by saying that we havent actually seen the stress emerge as of yet so i wouldnt necessarily use the term mechanistic but i would say that what we took in the first quarter is our best estimate of future losses its also important to note that we dont reserve for future growth and so future growth with all else being equal be a reserve build so i wouldnt necessarily think of this as materially different because of cecl we didnt actually really think about the impact of cecl relative to the incurred model the regulators have given their point of view on that given the change in the capital rules where is assumed to be the difference but thats their view and like i said we didnt spend a lot of time thinking about it and i would say that it is our best estimate of the losses that will inevitably emerge through this crisis and it is life of loan which of course is different under cecl and so again all else equal you can think card was larger than it would have been under an incurred model but we didnt really think about it that way and its impossible of course to know what judgment we would have applied under a different model saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay no thats helpful and jenn just on that point of growth pivoting a little bit what obviously a lot of the pressure in cet1 was because of riskweighted asset growth and drawdowns on commitments where do you think we are in terms of those drawdowns i think its like billion still in wholesale commitment unfunded commitments but like how do we think about that and how much room there is for that to continue to maybe pressure riskweighted asset evolution jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so like so many other things it is difficult to predict i will say that early here in the second quarter we have seen a pause on revolver draws but it could very well just be a pause and so were assuming as we think about our own capital plans that we will see revolver draws continue in the second quarter albeit at lower levels than the first quarter and then of course the timing and the pace of the paydowns will depend upon the ultimate path of the virus and the economic recovery operator our next question is from glenn schorr of evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much i appreciate the limited sight we all have maybe lets assume hopefully sooner than later we get past the bulk of the credit impact on the other side of this have you thought about lending spreads underwriting criteria and how much turns need to tighten given what weve learned or a scenario that we didnt jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 capture under previous underwriting in other words does lending spreads widen and do you get paid more for your balance sheet im just curious how youre thinking about risk management on a goforward basis jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so there i would say that our approach we always take a longterm franchise view on things like that and so our philosophy has not changed it is true however that the marginal cost of new activity is higher for us right now and so thats a consideration but i would say in terms of risk management we do what weve always done and what we always do which is manage carefully within our risk appetite and i think that has served us well coming into this crisis and well continue to stay close to our clients and manage that carefully jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co id just add on the consumer side you have a forwardlooking view of risk on the wholesale side the revolvers were taking down which are like billion are existing spreads the bilateral stuff is being done ie new credits theyre being done at slightly different spreads and stuff like that higher and then trading obviously youre actually getting higher spreads in a lot of the things you do in trading you finance people and do things and stuff like that and then you will see a tightening of credit in the market think of leveraged lending certain underwriting certain nonbank lenders who are no longer there so you will see an eventual tightening and an eventual increase in spreads what you wont see banks do is price gouge which youve seen in other industries banks are very careful to support their clients through times like this glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay and then one more impossible question jenn maybe could you help qualify i know you cant quantify but exit rate revenues that you kind of alluded to in some of the things like underwriting falling off so tale of two quarters the quarter itself if it werent for the ginormous credit issue that were facing would have been like ah revenues down a little bit expenses up a drop okay but how much of the exit rate revenues are we looking at second quarter third quarter versus the full first quarter i know its a hard one jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so glenn im glad you acknowledge that its an impossible question and a hard one and so theres a reason why we gave directional guidance here in terms of what could be headwinds but it is just impossible to predict right now as you point out but i will say if you think theres obviously nothing that we can really say with confidence about exit rates in but i will say based upon the latest implieds if you look at nii you could see growth in on balance sheet growth there and then nir is absolutely going to depend on the path of the virus and the economic recovery and when and how we all get back to work and then weve given you expense guidance to think about and then from a credit perspective as i said we could see continued builds over the next several quarters but the way cecl works in theory again all else equal is that that should be could be behind us by the end of the year and we then have those reserves to absorb the losses that will inevitably emerge over the back half of this year and into operator our next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning can you indiscernible i know you gave us the color on the best case of the downturn in the second quarter what is your outlook on that recovery in the second half of the year can you give us any color on what kind of recovery youre expecting for the second half of the year as part of the cecl reserve buildout jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so i dont have the numbers to hand gerard but theyre public it was i suppose you can say it was based on our economists outlook at the end of march which did have a recovery i just dont have the gdp numbers to hand and the unemployment i think whats most important to note gerard is that based upon what were looking at you do have a recovery in the back half of the year but it still leaves you from a gdp perspective and unemployment below your launch point on absolute levels of gdp and above your launch point on absolute levels of unemployment so its a recovery it is our latest outlook and as i said earlier its probably the only thing we know for sure is that that is going to change through time but it is a recovery in the back half of the year that doesnt get us back to where we started and importantly as weve said that were prepared for a range of scenarios so while that may be the case that we based our reserve levels of it is not the only scenario that we are preparing for gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just as a follow up on the bridge book and i apologize if you addressed this and i missed it i know you guys mentioned the losses in the bridge book could ph you tell us the size of the book and then some more color on what triggered the losses in the bridge book jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so there i would just start by i said it in the prepared remarks but its worth repeating our bridge book is about a quarter of the size it was in the financial crisis so its about billion its slightly down from where we were at yearend importantly we dont have any imminent closing deadlines and the market is actually performing a little bit better here in the second quarter so well see where we land at the end of the quarter but so far jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co its just basically marking the provisions to market jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co effectively jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and the good news is with no imminent jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co exfees jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right and with no imminent closing deadlines its not necessarily the case that well realize those losses but as jamie said theyre marktomarket at the end of the quarter jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and i would just also put into some perspective were adults we know that when you have a bridge loan book that youre going to have quarters where things get bad where you might lose some money were the leader in leverage lending were the leader in high yield the leader in loans et cetera and we intend to maintain that position and every now and then youll have not a particularly good quarter so were not we dont worry about this very much and like jenn said so far if you look at spreads its probably a recovery this quarter operator our next question is from john mcdonald of autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi jenn regarding credit cards just based on payment rates that youve seen so far and maybe the draws on revolves how are you expecting card spending and card balances to trend over the next few quarters this year jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah hi john so based upon what were looking at right now spend was down we talked about different categories but spend in aggregate was down in the month of march yearoveryear and were seeing trends like that continue here in april and so with that i would say that we would given what we know today expect outstandings to trend down from here john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research and then can you help us think about how you do the accounting for the consumer deferrals you keep accruing but do you add some kind of haircut for nii suppression in terms of what might not be collectible even though technically youre allowed to accrue what you defer jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah you got it john so we do continue to accrue but it is a lower yield over the life of the loan jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 operator our next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just want i have two questions one just thinking about the outlook for the next couple of quarters here i know you mentioned that your economics team had updated their estimates and maybe you could give us a sense as to the timing of when you clip your reserves versus those estimate changes and part of the reason im asking is because of the reserve ratio move between and for the various segments when i look at the cib and the commercial bank the reserve ratios are down from where they were in so im trying to understand how the next change in the reserving is likely to traject between the various asset classes is there as you move from an adverse case to a severely adverse case are there different asset classes that potentially have a higher uptick in reserve ratio that we should be expecting here jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so on the wholesale side specifically betsy the reason you see that dynamic is because of cecl and its in the presentation so you can see the numbers so we the cecl adoption impact in wholesale was a net release and so weve now built back and so thats why you see that dynamic there and then in terms of the reserving when we closed the books which was here in earlyapril we do have to of course kind of snap the chalk line at some point and close the books which is why we wanted to be very transparent about how we think about reserving going forward because like i said all else equal given the macroeconomic outlook that were looking at that we would expect to have a build in the second quarter and perhaps beyond because as i said obviously everything is incredibly fluid and we need to we really need to learn a lot about the ultimate impact of these programs because they are extraordinary and should have an extraordinary impact but we need some time to learn jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and also just to betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 add on the wholesale side at one point you have an overlay about what you expect in terms of migration downward and downgrade and stuff like that it would also be name by name company by company name by name reserve by reserve so a real detailed review of that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so as we think through because effectively i think what were saying is theres the possibility of the severely adverse case coming which we can look back at prior fed stress tests to see what you anticipated that to mean for the credit losses and maybe jamie if we can get an understanding as to how youre thinking about what your economists are looking for versus prior severely adverse stress cases that you have run on your own bank is this fair to look at the severely adverse stress cases on a bankrun modeling basis that we have access to and its in line with that kind of level or is this something that is even a little bit tougher and specifically around things like commercial real estate i get the name by name on the corporate side that is obviously extraordinarily granular and you have access to that but im wondering on the commercial real estate side is there anything we should be thinking about thats different from perhaps what the fed stress test might have suggested in the past jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co ill start by saying commercial real estate eventually it will be loan by loan and name by name too so if you have reason to believe that a loan is bad youre going to write it down and put a reserve against it something like that this is such a dramatic change of events so there is no models that have done dealt with gdp down unemployment growing this rapidly and thats one part there are also no models that have ever dealt with a government which is doing a ppp program which might be billion it might be billion unemployment it looks like of people going on unemployment book higher income than before they went on unemployment so what does that mean for credit cards and something like that or that the government is just going to make direct payments to people so this is all in the works right now the company is in very good shape we can serve our clients and were going to give you more detail on this but its happening as we speak and i think people are making too much of a mistake trying to model it when we get to the end of the second quarter well know exactly what happened in the second quarter we know you got to respect the credit card delinquencies and charges will go up though weve seen very little of it so far but in the second quarter youll see more of it and then well also know if theres a fourth round of government stimulus well know a whole bunch of stuff and well report that out well hope for the best which is you have that recovery and plan for the worst so you can handle it jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and then in terms of planning for the worst betsy maybe it would be helpful the extreme adverse scenario that jamie referenced in his chairmans letter had credit costs of more than billion so clearly that is not our central case but thats the kind of scenario that we are making sure that were prepared for and then just coincidentally if you look at our credit costs from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of across those five quarters we had credit costs of billion so jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co right i forgot the number reserves went from like billion to billion back to billion jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co reserving itself is procyclical and often wrong and youre required to do it but it certainly doesnt match revenues and expenses so we like to be conservative in reserving but i have to point out the flaws of it operator our next question is from brian kleinhanzl of kbw brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks good morning just a couple questions again one on cecl maybe to start with can you just maybe give a little more qualitative disclosure on how this payment relief factors in are you assuming some amount of government programs get used and thats included or is this just payment relief that youre directly giving to consumers and corporates just trying to get a sense of how all these government programs kind of flow through the model jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure brian so you can think about the government stimulus as being incorporated in the macroeconomic variables and then the payment relief those are im referring to our own programs there and there we based upon our judgment and experience in the past we apply some percentage of pullthrough in the portfolio of people who will get payment relief and then we think about the impact that that could have again i would say both while estimated for the first quarter well know a whole lot more about both of them for the second quarter jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and jenn remind me when we do the 10q for the quarter were going to lay out lots of these various assumptions about cecl and one of the problems with cecl is this precisely were going to spend all day on cecl which was billion and its kind of a drop in the bucket but its a lot of data its like all the data we did after the last crisis we give you on level and all these assumptions and stuff like that no one ever looks at it anymore jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thats right and we still have jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 and every company does it differently jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and we still have obviously several weeks before the q and so well be able to give our best view on things then brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then in the quarter you gave what the marks were on the bridge loans but is there a way to frame what the total marks were assuming credit spreads tightened kind of dramatically post quarter end so it seems like there would be a reversal of some of those marks initially jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah there could be but thats only where we are at this point in the quarter and so it will obviously all depend on the market from now to the end of the quarter but right now the market is performing a bit better and spreads have come in as you mentioned jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co a couple of the deals may be syndicated hopefully might be syndicated by the end of the second or third quarter operator our next question is from chris kotowski of oppenheimer chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah good morning thank you at investor day jamie said that the real earnings are preprovision earnings minus net chargeoffs indiscernible jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i dont about you guys but i cant we cant understand a word youre saying jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah chris this is unfortunately part of our all our new reality as we all work remotely we couldnt hear you chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc sorry is this better jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 yes chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay so my apologies at investor day jamie said something like that the real economic earnings are pre provision earnings minus net chargeoffs which i agree with and so if you push aside all the cecl reserving noise im curious does the customer relief the 90day grace period does that alter the historic chargeoff assumptions like for example credit card was always pretty cookie cutter days after delinquency its charged off and maybe with auto so will those customer relief periods pushback the chargeoff curve as well jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co it may because as long as a customer is performing under the forbearance program they are not delinquent but of course it will all depend on whether these programs ultimately are able to bridge people back to employment chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc right okay but if jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well know a lot more in days well certainly know a lot more in days about how this affected what we wouldve expected jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and to jamies point what we may learn over the next days is of course whether programs have been effective or whether theyve just delayed losses and of course with cecl being life of loan if its just delayed losses you can expect that that would we would be reserving for that chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay but in terms of chargeoffs while normally in regards to credit cards after days it now might be days am i getting that right jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co it may be it may be but again its going to just completely depend on whether people are able to remain performing under a payment relief or a forbearance program but we dont really think about it that way we think about what the ultimate losses will be and we reserve for that and then importantly in the first quarter the chargeoffs youre seeing which is why i was clear to say it was consistent with prior expectations because the chargeoffs in the first quarter of course dont at all reflect the ultimate impact of covid19 they were just normal bau i would say operator our next question is from andrew lim of socgén jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2020 andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi good morning thanks for taking my questions so firstly on government guaranteed loans these are zero percent riskweighted and im wondering to what extent youre using them to refinance existing loans on your portfolios and if you are to what extent riskweighted assets have gone through as you do those jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so im not sure specifically what program youre referring to i would just say broadly speaking on the fed facilities theyre obviously very large programs rolled out very quickly and just an extraordinary response to unprecedented market conditions here we are happy to leverage the facilities to intermediate these programs for our clients but we are only using them where it makes sense to ensure that credit and liquidity is flowing to where its needed andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk so just to maybe elaborate on that is there may be some part where theres a bit of a capital uplift if you use government guaranteed loans to represent risk weighting where previously jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co what uplift what uplift andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk a capital uplift so your risk weighted assets go down say for something like corporate loans that now are government guaranteed jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co look well incorporate all of that into how we run the company trying to serve the client et cetera and there are peculiar things like the ppp that you put in your balance sheet as zero rwa but it does affect a lot of other things like slr and gsifi and stuff like that because if you sell it to the government it all goes away and well manage through that as we learn how these programs are working and what we want to do operator and we have no further questions at this time jennifer a piepszak chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks thanks everyone jamie dimon chairman
