management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases first quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please standby at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jeremy barnum mr barnum please go ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you very much and good morning everyone the presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back turning on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion and delivered an rotce of these results included a million increase in the special assessment resulting from the fdics updated estimate of expected losses from the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank touching on a couple of highlights firmwide ib fees were up year onyear reflecting particular strength in underwriting fees and weve seen strong net inflows across awm as well as in the ccb wealth management business on page we have some more detail this is the last quarter well discuss results excluding first republic given that going forward first republic results will naturally be included in the prior period making yearonyear results comparable for this quarter first republic contributed billion of revenue million of expense and million of net income now focusing on the firmwide results excluding first republic revenue of billion was up billion or yearonyear nii ex markets was up million or driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates as well as higher revolving balances in card largely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in ccb nir ex markets was up billion or driven by higher firmwide asset management and investment banking fees as well as lower net investment securities losses and markets revenue was down million or yearonyear expenses of billion were up billion or yearon year driven by higher compensation including growth in employees and the increase of the fdics special assessment and credit costs were billion reflecting net chargeoffs of billion and a net reserve release of million net chargeoffs were up million predominately driven by card on the balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of relatively flat versus the prior quarter reflecting net income which was predominantly offset by higher rwa and capital distribution this quarters higher rwa is largely due to seasonal effects including higher client activity in markets and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets partially offset by lower card loans now lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page consumers remained financially healthy supported by a resilient labor market while cash buffers have largely normalized balances are still above prepandemic levels and wages are keeping pace with inflation when looking at a stable cohort of customers overall spend is in line with the prior year turning now to the financial results excluding first republic ccb reported net income of billion on revenue of billion which was up yearonyear in banking wealth management revenue was down year onyear reflecting lower nii on lower deposits with average balances down as our indiscernible mix increased client investment assets were up yearonyear driven by market performance and strong net inflows in home lending revenue was up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher nii and production jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 revenue originations while still modest were up moving to card services auto revenue was up yearonyear driven by higher card services nii on higher revolving balances partially offset by higher card acquisition costs from new account growth and lower auto lease income card outstandings were up due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve and in auto originations were billion down while we maintained healthy margins and market share expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing in terms of credit performance this quarter credit costs were billion driven by net chargeoffs which were up million yearonyear predominately due to continued normalization in card the net reserve build was million reflecting the build in card largely offset by a release in home lending next the corporate investment bank on page before reporting cibs results i want to note that this will also be the last quarter we will report earnings for the cib and cb as standalone segments between now and investor day we will furnish an 8k with historical results including five quarters and two full years of history consistent with the structure of the new commercial and investment bank segment in line with the reorganization that was announced in january turning back to this quarter cib reported net income of billion on revenue of billion investment banking revenue of billion was up yearonyear ib fees were up yearonyear and we ranked number one with yeartodate wallet share of in advisory fees were down driven by fewer large completed deals underwriting fees were up significantly benefiting from improved market conditions with debt up and equity up in terms of the outlook while were encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter we need to be mindful that some meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year similarly while it was encouraging to see some positive momentum in announced ma in the quarter it remains to be seen whether that will continue and the advisory business still faces structural headwinds from the regulatory environment payments revenue was billion down yearonyear as deposit margin normalization and depositrelated client credits were largely offset by higher feebased revenue and deposit balances moving to markets total revenue was billion down yearonyear fixed income was down driven by lower activity in rates and commodities compared to a strong prioryear quarter partially offset by strong results in securitized products equity markets was flat securities services revenue of billion was up yearonyear expenses of billion were down yearonyear predominantly driven by lower legal expense moving to the commercial bank on page commercial banking reported net income of billion revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher noninterest revenue gross investment banking and markets revenue of million was up yearonyear with increased ib fees largely offset by lower markets revenue compared to a strong prioryear quarter payments revenue of billion was down yearonyear driven by lower deposit margins and balances largely offset by fee growth net of higher depositrelated client credits expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher compensation reflecting an increase in employees including front office and technology investments as well as higher volume related expense average deposits were down yearonyear primarily driven by lower nonoperating deposits and down quarteronquarter reflecting seasonally lower balances loans were flat quarteronquarter ci loans were down percentage reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients remain cautious and cre loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff activity finally credit costs were a net benefit of million including a net reserve release of million and net chargeoffs of million then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 with pretax margin of revenue of billion was down year on year excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year revenue was up driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels partially offset by lower nii due to deposit margin compression expenses of billion were up year on year largely driven by higher compensation including revenue related compensation continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of the jpmorgan asset management china acquisition as well as higher distributional fees for the quarter longterm net inflows were billion led by equities and fixed income aum of trillion was up year on year and client assets of trillion were up year on year driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows and finally loans were down quarter on quarter and deposits were flat turning to corporate on page corporate reported net income of million revenue was billion up billion year on year nii was billion up million year on year driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates nir was a net loss of million the current quarter included net investment securities losses of million compared with net securities losses of million in the prioryear quarter expenses of billion were up million yearonyear predominately driven by the increase to the fdic special assessment to finish off we have the outlook on page we now expect nii exmarkets to be approximately billion based on a forward curve that contained three rate cuts at quarterend our total nii guidance remains approximately billion which implies a decrease in our markets nii guidance from around billion to around billion the primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix shift in the markets business and as a reminder changes in markets nii are generally revenueneutral our outlook for adjusted expense is now about billion reflecting the increase to the fdic special assessment i mentioned upfront and on credit we continue to expect the card net chargeoff rate to be below finally you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter and it will likely stay around this year absent discrete items which can vary quite a bit the driver of this change is the firms adoption of the proportional amortization method for certain tax equity investments our managed rate is unchanged and it should average about above the effective tax rate this is a smaller gap than we previously observed and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going forward although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it has in the past for the avoidance of doubt these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income were just mentioning this to help with your models so to wrap up were pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey towards nii normalization begins while we remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios the economic geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent and we are focused on being prepared to navigate those challenges as well as any others that may come our way and with that lets open up the line for qa jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 question and answer section operator the first question is coming from the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley you may proceed betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so a couple of questions here just one jamie could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of midcycle it felt like preccar and also help us understand how youre thinking about where that payout ratio that dividend payout ratio range should be because over the past several years its been somewhere between and and so is this suggesting we could be towards the higher end of that range or even expanding above that and then i also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the cet1 at here the minimum is i know its we have to wait for basel iii endgame reproposal to come through and all that but should we be expecting that hey were going to hold cet1 until we know all these rules thanks james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so betsy before i answer the question i want to say something on behalf of all of us at jpmorgan and me personally thrilled to have you on this call for those who dont know betsy has been through a terrible medical episode and its a reminder to all of us how lucky we are to be here but betsy in particular the amount of respect we have not just in your work but in your character over the last 20plus years has been exceptional so on behalf of all of us i just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here and so youre asking a pertinent question so were earning a lot of money our capital cup runneth over and thats why we increased the dividend and if youre asking me what wed like to do is to pay out something like a third a third of normalized earnings of course its hard to calculate always what normalized earnings are but we dont mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes a little bit behind that sometimes if i could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance et cetera i think the far more important question is the so look at the im going to oversimplify it that basically will prepare us for the total basel endgame today roughly the specifics dont matter that much remember we can do a lot of things to change that in the short run or the long run but it looks like basel iii endgame may not be the worst case itll be something less than that so obviously when and if that happens it would free up a lot of capital and im going to say in the order of billion or something like that and yes weve always had the capital hierarchy the same way which is were going to use capital to build our business first i mean pay the dividend steady dividend build the business and if we think its appropriate to buy back stock were continuing to buy back stock at billion a year i personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 i think youve all heard me talk about the world things like that so waiting in preparation for basel hopefully well know something later and then we can be much more specific with you all but in the meantime theres also its very important to put in mind there are shortterm uses for capital that are good for shareholders that could reduce our cet1 too so you may see us do things in the short run that will increase earnings increase capital that are using up that capital jeremy mentioned on the on one of the things that we know the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and trading we could do things now so its a great position to be in were going to be very very patient i urge all the analysts to keep in mind excess capital is not wasted capital its earnings in store we will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc excellent thank you so much jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and yeah betsy i just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well and just a very minor edit to jamies answer i think he just misspoke when he said billion a year in buybacks the trajectory is billion james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co oh sorry billion a quarter yeah jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co a quarter otherwise i have nothing to add to jamies very complete answer but welcome back betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you so much and appreciate it looking forward to seeing you at investor day on may jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co excellent us too betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right operator thank you our next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport global you may proceed jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning jeremy can you speak to the trends youre seeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter if theres been any change have you seen that migration start to slow or not jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah a good question jim i think the simplest and best answer to that is not really so as weve been saying for a while migration from checking and savings to cds is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the consumer deposit franchise that continues we continue to capture that money in motion at a very high rate were very happy about what that means about the consumer franchise and level of engagement that were seeing im aware that theres a little bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting weve looked at that data we see some evidence that maybe its slowing a little bit were quite cautious on that we really sort of dont think it makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is ph above that youre not going to see ongoing migration and frankly we expect to see that even in a world where even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yieldseeking behavior so its quite conceivable and this is actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it we were still nonetheless expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues so i would say no meaningful change in the trends and the expectation for ongoing migration is very much still there jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay and just a followup on that and just sort of bigger picture on nii is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook is it migration is it the forward curve is it balances it sounds like its migration but just id be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i mean i think the drivers of lets say whats embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter meaning its the current yield curve which is a little bit stale now but the snap from quarterend had roughly three cuts in it so its the current yield curve its what i just said the expectation of ongoing internal migration there is some meaningful offset from card revolve growth which while its a little bit less than it was in prior years is still a tailwind there we expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down so thats a little bit of a headwind at the margin and then theres obviously the wild card of potential product level reprice which we always say were going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace and you know this obviously but in a world where weve got something like billion of deposits paying effectively zero relatively small changes in the product level reprice can change the nii run rate by a lot so the ph arrow bands here are pretty wide and were always going to stick with our mantra which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the longterm health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right okay great thanks for the color jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks operator thank you our next question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research you may proceed john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp thanks jeremy you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the street might need to build in more reserve growth for the card growth youve had more reserve build we didnt see that this quarter is that just kind of seasonal and would you still expect the kind of growth math to play out in terms of card growth and reserve build needs jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah john so in short yes to both questions so yes the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of card yes we still expect card loan growth for the full year and yes that still means that all else equal we think the consensus for the allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low if you map it to that expected card loan growth obviously theres the wild card of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal process of assessing the skew in the seasonal distribution and so on and were not speaking to that one way or the other so if guys have your own opinions about that thats fine but were narrowly just saying that based on the card loan growth that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that we do expect build in the back half of the year john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay got it and then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the markets nii that outlooks being revised down by billion but revenueneutral i guess the obvious thing is there theres typically an offset in fee income and you dont guide to that but the idea would be the way youre structuring trades the way the balance sheet is evolving there are some offset that youd expect in markets fees from the lower markets nii correct jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co that is exactly right and specifically whats going on here is theres shift between onbalance sheet and off balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within markets and you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related so fundamentally you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet noninterestbearing highfunding expense negative for nii or we receive that in total return form through derivatives exactly the same economics no impact on nii so that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral its secondorder effects but they change the geography quite a bit and thats what happened this quarter and thats why weve been emphasizing for some time that the nii exmarkets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp got it thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america you may proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess just in terms of jeremy when you think about the outlook for the economy i would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base both commercial and consumer and when we think about higher for longer maybe the economy is too strong so we dont get any rate cuts are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback youre getting from your bankers where the momentum is picking up and i appreciate all the macro risks that jamie has pointed out but im just getting trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what youre seeing today from the customers james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i would say consumer customers are fine the unemployment is very low home prices are up stock prices are up the amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low but the extra money of the lower income folks is running out not running out but normalizing and you see credit normalizing a little bit and of course higherincome folks still have more money theyre still spending it so whatever happens the customer is in pretty good shape and theyre if they you go into a recession theyll be in pretty good shape businesses are in good shape if you look at it today their confidence is up their order books are up their profits are up but what i caution people these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending a lot of qe et cetera and so we dont really know whats going to happen and i also want to look at the year look at two years or three years all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place our elections et cetera so were in good were okay right now it does not mean were okay down the road and if you look at any inflection point being okay in the current time is always true that was true in it was true in any time weve had it so i just im just on the more cautious side how people feel and confidence levels and all that that doesnt necessarily stop you from having an inflection point and so everything is okay today but youve got to be prepared for a range of outcomes which we are and the other thing i want to point out because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and nii and credit losses its one thing to project it today based on what not what we think in economic scenarios but the generally accepted economic scenario which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the fed but these numbers have always been wrong you have to ask the question what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession et cetera then all these numbers change i just dont think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens and i just think the chance of happening is higher than other people i dont know the outcome we dont want to guess jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 the outcome ive never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in the economy literally in my life or in history ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just tied to that as we look at commercial real estate both for jp and for the economy overall is higher rates alone enough to create more vulnerability than issues beyond office cre like how would you characterize the health of the cre market thank you james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so ill put it into two buckets okay first of all were fine weve got good reserves against office we think our multifamily is fine jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want but if you think of real estate theres two pieces if rates go up think of the yield curve the whole yield curve not fed funds but the 10year bond rate it goes up all assets all assets every asset on the planet including real estate is worth less well obviously that creates a little bit of stress and strain and people have to roll those over and finance it more thats not just true for real estate its true for everybody and that happens leveraged loans real estate will have some effect the second thing is the why does that happen if that happens because we have a strong economy well thats not so bad for real estate because people will be hiring and ph filling things out and other financial assets if that happens because we have stagflation well thats the worst case all of a sudden you are going to have more vacancies you are going to have more companies cutting back you are going to have less leases it will affect including multifamily that will filter through the whole economy in a way that we people havent really experienced since so i just put in the back of your mind the why is important the interest rates are important the recession is important if things stay where they are today we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace everyone will the real estate will muddle through obviously it will be idiosyncratic if youre in different cities and different types and b versus a buildings and all of that but people muddle through they wont muddle through under higher rates with the recession that would be tough for a lot of folks and not just real estate if in fact that happens ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc helpful thank you so much jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks ebrahim operator thank you our next question comes from erika najarian with ubs you may proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning given that your response to betsys question is that cet1 today prepares you for basel iii endgame as written you earn on without the fdic assessment ahead of investor day i guess six jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 weeks from now or a week from now as we think about that through the cycle target if youre at the right capital level per you guys where are you overearning today jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right so interesting framing of the question erika so i think weve been pretty consistent about where were overearning right so obviously one major area is that were overearning in deposit margin especially in consumer and thats sort of why were expecting sequential declines in nii why weve talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid so i think thats probably the single biggest source of lets call it excess earnings currently you also have heard jamie say that were overearning in credit i mean wholesale chargeoffs have been particularly low but we have builds for that so in the current run rate a bit less clear the extent of what were earning and in card of course while chargeoffs are now close to normalized essentially we did go through an extended period of chargeoffs being very low by historical standards although that was coupled with nii also being low by historical standards so from a bottom line perspective its not entirely clear what the net of that was but broadly its really deposit margin thats the biggest single factor in the overearning narrative embedded in your question i think is a little bit of the what are you thinking about the cet1 in light of the current level of capital and so on and you did talk about investor day i was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at investor day in light of potential updates of the basel iii endgame given that the single most important factor for that is how much denominator expansion do we see through the basel iii endgame at the rate were going we wont actually know that much more about that by investor day so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate what ive said in the past which is that whatever it is its going to be very good our returns in absolute terms very good in relative terms we will optimize we will seek to reprice we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability but given the structure of the rule as proposed at least a lot of this cannot be optimized away and so in the base case you have to think of it as a headwind erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just as a followup question you mentioned that the current curve that you set your nii outlook upon is stale i guess does it matter that it seems like the market is downpricing and obviously no june cut no september cut and a tossup in december which shouldnt matter for this year as we think about that billion if we price rate cuts out totally does that matter much given it seems like june is the only one that would jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sorry erika so just quick things on this one lets focus on nii ex not on total nii so id anchor you to the billion number two if you want to do math for like the changes of the average fund rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the ph eir like be my guest its like as good as an approach as any but i would just once again remind you of the billion of deposits paying practically zero that very small changes there can make a big difference and weve got other factors weve got the impact of qt on deposit balances et cetera et cetera et cetera so we want to make sure that we dont get too precise here were giving you our best guess based on a series of assumptions and its going to be where its going to be jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co which we know are going to be wrong erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thanks operator thank you our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies you may proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning jeremy i was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments when you talked about we all have hopes and expectations for the investment banking pipeline that continue to move along we obviously saw the good movement in ecm and dcm and the lag in advisory can you just talk about that you mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side with as it relates to ma on like gonogo type of feel in conversation levels and then what are you thinking we need to have to kickstart just another good level of ipo activity in the ecm markets thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure yeah let me take the ipo first so we have been a little bit cautious there some cohorts and vintages of ipos have performed somewhat disappointingly i think that narrative has changed to a meaningful degree this quarter so i think were seeing better ipo performance obviously equity markets have been under a little bit of pressure last few days but in general we have a lot of support there and that always helps dialogue is quite good a lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms multinationals carveout type things so dialogue is good valuation environment is better like sort of decent reasons for optimism there but of course with ecm theres always a pipeline dynamic and conditions were pretty good this quarter and so we caution a little bit there about pullforward which is even more acute i think on the dcm side given that quite a high percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year has gotten done in the first quarter so thats a factor and then the question of ma i think is probably the single most important question not only because of its impact on ma but also because its not going to impact on dcm through acquisition financing and so on and theres the wellknown kind of regulatory headwinds there and thats definitely having a bit of a chilling effect i dont know ive heard some narratives that maybe theres like some pentup deal demand who knows how important politics are in all this so i dont know were fundamentally as i said i think on the press call happy to see momentum this quarter happy to see momentum in announced ma a little bit cautious about the pullforward dynamic a little bit cautious about the regulatory headwinds and in the end were just going to fight really hard for our share of the wallet here ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and i guess ill just stick on the theme of capital markets and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher comp in fic i think you guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place and i jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 know thats impossible to guide on but just maybe talk through some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the fixed income and equities business and do you feel like this is the type of environment where given that lingering uncertainty about rates clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how theyre positioning portfolios thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah really good question i would say in general that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is actually supportive for the markets revenue pool and i think that together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of some level of natural background growth is one of the reasons that the overall level of markets revenue has stabilized meaningfully above what was normal in the prepandemic period and while that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like oh is this sustainable might there be downside here for now that does seem to be the new normal and i do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic in global rates that not only affects the rates business but it affects the foreign exchange business it generally just makes asset allocation decisions more important and more interesting and so all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it and so on and so forth so i think that those are some of the themes on the markets side at the margin and yeah well see how the rest of the year goes but it sort of seems to be behaving relatively normally i would say operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo you may proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi jamie im just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your ceo letter im sure the pages i can see you put a lot of effort into that and its appreciated but you talked about scenarios tail risk macro risk geopolitical risk and all that over several years if not weeks or months i get it on the other hand the firm is investing so much more outside the us whether its commercial or some digital banking consumer or wholesale payments so im just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words and specifically how is global wholesale payments going you mentioned youre in countries you do business a lot more how is that business in particular doing thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right mike so im sorry to tell you that jamie actually left us because hes at a leadership offsite thats why he was here remote so i think he left the call in my hands for better or for worse but let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for jamie here i think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook part of the point there is to note that the us is not isolated from that if we had global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations thats not only a problem outside of the us that affects the global economy and therefore the us and therefore our corporate customers et cetera et cetera and in that context keeping in mind what we always say that we invest throughthecycle that we sort of go into countries and then leave countries et cetera obviously we adjust around the edges we manage risks we do make choices as a function of the overall geopolitical environment but for all these the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this company has always had which is its sort of global character because of a jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 particular moment geopolitically would just be inconsistent with how weve always operated and in terms of the wholesale payments business its going great were taking share theres been a lot of innovation there a lot of investment in technology a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world and yeah im sure well give you more color in other settings on that but its a good story its a nice thing to see mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just as a follow up to that then why is it doing great in terms of wholesale payments given such the the dislocations in the world from wars to supply chain changes everything else why is wholesale payments doing great jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co well i think one of the things about payments business is that in some sense they are i mean recession proof is probably the wrong word and in any case were not dealing with the recession right were talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world and thats a thing that people need to do more or less no matter what so thats one piece but i think the other piece is that our willingness to invest which has always been a focus of yours is one of the key things separating us in this business right now and so we are seeing the benefits of that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore you may proceed glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you your commentary with kens questions were great and clear on investment banking for the near term in this year i have a bigger picture question in terms of youre always so good in spelling out where youre over earning do you feel like youre underearning on the investment banking side and i just use some of your own numbers from the past of like the market has added like trillion of equity market cap and trillion of fixed income market cap last years yet the wallet is like plus below the 10year average so is there just a bigger upside and its just a matter of when not if jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah glenn in short yes i mean i think were not shy about saying that were underearning in investment banking right now clearly were below cycle averages as you point out weve been talking about when do we get back to the prepandemic wallet but as you know i mean on this point what it was like march right was the beginning of the pandemic so its like four years ago at this point so there has been gdp growth especially in nominal terms during that period and you would expect the wallet to growth with that so i do think jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 theres meaningful upside in the investment banking fee wallet as ive noted there are some headwinds i think particularly in ma but over time you would hope that the amount of ma is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the regulatory environment so you could see some mean reversion there and yeah so thats why were sort of leaning in were engaging with clients were making sure that were appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of share glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi cool maybe one other follow up youre always investing you clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do but relative to a lot of other banks that have been keeping the expenses a lot closer to flat do you envision environment or maybe i should rephrase that what type of environment would have jpmorgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that youve been going through jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so i think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but im going to say it anyway is that there are some like auto governors in this right like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue whether its volumerelated commissions whether its incentive compensation whether its other things so there are some autocorrecting elements of the expense base that would happen automatically as part of the normal discipline so thats point one point two is that independently of the environment we are always looking for efficiencies its a little bit hard to see it and in a world where were guiding to i guess now with the special assessment added billion of expenses its hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that have been generated underneath but that is part of the dna of the company that does happen in bau all the time as we grind things out get the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency and i think to get to the heart of your question which is okay in what type of an environment would we make different strategic questions and in the end i think thats a little bit about what that environment is really like so if you talk about like a normal recession visibility on the cycle would we change our longterm strategic investment plans which are always built up from a financial modeling perspective assuming resilience through thecycle no we wouldnt could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments or even certain businesses that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices yes but that would be because the throughthecycle analysis has changed for some reason i just dont see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is unchanged simply because of the business cycle in the short term glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi awesome thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks operator thank you our next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank you may proceed jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning you mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet and we just see the trading assets going up  which is probably seasonal but also up a lot yearoveryear but not necessarily translate into higher revenues and i know they dont like match up necessarily each quarter but maybe just elaborate like how youre leaning into the trading with the balance sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so let me break this question down into a couple of different parts so i think what jamie was sort of suggesting is that you can think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term and what hes kind of saying is that in a moment where youre carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strategic reasons you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of that with kind of like into relatively shortduration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason and what might be thought of as a tactical sense so hes just pointing out that thats an option that you have and the extent to which this quarters increase in markets rwa is a reflection of that maybe a little bit but probably not i agree with you that its hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and rwa to a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there but for sure one thing thats true is the higher run rate of the markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second ago is linked also to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses so as you well know we pride ourselves on being extremely analytical and extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity balance sheet deployment gsib capacity utilization et cetera in the markets business and we dont just chase revenue we go after returns fully measured and thats part of the dna and we continue to do it and we will so that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints and obviously the environment is complex so the ability to sort of throw a ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always but big picture we are clearly in a very very strong capital position which is in no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the basel iii endgame is final we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it and then just separately within the consumer card businesses you highlighted volumes were up yearoveryear obviously still a very strong piece any trends within that that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category either overall or among certain segments thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co maybe a little bit jamie already alluded somewhat to this so i do think spend is fine but not boomy broadly speaking i would say you can look at it a lot of different ways inflation cohorts et cetera but when you kind of triangulate that you get back to this kind of flattish picture there is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary and i think the single most notable thing is just this effect where in the while it is true that real incomes have gone up in the lowest income cohorts within that theres obviously a probability distribution and theres some or rather just a distribution of outcomes and there are some set of people whose real incomes are not up theyre down and who are therefore struggling a little bit unfortunately and what you jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 observe in the spending patterns of those people is some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of aggressive levering up so i think thats maybe an economic indicator of sorts although this portion of the population is small enough that im not sure the reader cost is that big but it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationally and in a sort of normal postpandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets and thats sort of the margin good news from a credit perspective matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thank you very much jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks operator thank you our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets you may proceed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi jeremy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey gerard how are you doing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good thanks notwithstanding your guys outlook for uncertainty and of course jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed it also on this call when he was here earlier can you guys share or can you share with us the color on whats going on in the corporate lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter its not reflecting i dont think a real fear out there in the global geopolitical world and any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right so i think whats true about spreads in general just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the leveraged lending space is that theyre exceptionally tight so im sure thats reversed a little bit in the last few days but broadly throughout the quarter weve really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit you even see that a little bit in our oci this quarter where losses in oci that we wouldve had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in the portfolio so broadly sort of in keeping with the big runup that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary markets jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 that i think has manifested itself a little bit in the leveraged lending space in the normal way that it does in that theres a lot of competition among providers for the revenue pool and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned and as we have in the past we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we dont like the terms we never compromise on structure there so you are seeing a little bit of that i think that away from the leveraged lending space in the broader ci space there was a moment a few months ago where i think in no small part as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disciplining a little bit their lending youre seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads i dont know if that trend has like survived in the last few weeks and ph its always a little bit hard to observe in any case but i would say broadly the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the fact that overall asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you and i guess as a tiein to that question and answer weve read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country by private credit companies can you give us some color on what youre seeing there both as a competitor but also as a client of jpmorgan how you balance the two out where you may see them bidding on business that you like but at the same time youre supporting their business jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right yeah i mean i think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credit private equity community youre talking about different parts of the capital structure but we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients of each other in other areas and thats part of the franchise and its all good at some level but narrowly on private credit it is interesting to observe whats going on there so i would say for us the strategy there is very much to be productagnostic actually its not so much like oh is it private credit or is it syndicated lending its what does it take to be good at this stuff and what it takes is stuff that we have and have always had and that were very good at in each individual silos so you need underwriting skill structuring skill origination distribution secondary trading risk appetite credit analysis capabilities and this is what we do and were really good at it and increasingly what you see actually is that as you see us doing a little bit as the private credit space gets bigger it starts to make sense to actually bring in some colenders so that you can sort of do bigenough deals without having undue concentration risks i mean even if you have the capital you just may not want the concentration risk and so in a funny way the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space and at the same time the syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit unitranche structures gets pushed a little bit in the private credit direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works so were watching it the competitive dynamics are interesting certainly theres some pressure in some areas but we really do think that our overall value proposition and competitive position here is second to none and so were looking forward to the future here gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc appreciate the color thank you jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks gerard operator thank you our last question comes from charles peabody with portales your line is open charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut good morning a couple questions on the first republic acquisition some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun and im glad to see that jamie dimon validated that in his annual letter when you look at the first quarter it annualizes out to billion billion above the billion that jamie published in the letter i know you dont want to extrapolate that but can you remind us what sort of cost savings you still have in that because this quarter did see expenses come down to million down from million and then secondly is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and thats why you dont want to extrapolate the billion billion so thats my first question jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay thanks charlie and im going to do my best to answer your question while sticking to my sort of guns im not giving too much first republicspecific guidance but i do think that the kind of framework youre articulating is broadly correct so let me go through the pieces so yes the current quarters results annualize to more than the billion jamie talked about yes a big part of that reason is discount accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of shortdated assets so thats part of the reason that you see that converge yes its also true that we expect the expense run rate to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration obviously as i think as i mentioned to you last quarter from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect theres maybe an embedded question in there too about we had talked about billion of integration expense and the integration is real the expenses are real and also the time spent on that is quite real its a lot of work for a lot of people its going well but were not done yet and it takes a lot of effort but broadly i think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit lower than we originally assumed on the morning of the deal for a couple of reasons one is that the framework around the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a meaningful portion of the franchise and would sort of need to size the expense ph base accordingly and of course its worked out to your point quite a bit better than that and therefore the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher and that means less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers its probably also true that the integration assumptions were conservative they were based on kind of more typical type of bank ma assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the fdic and so on and so forth so yeah i think that probably is a pretty complete answer to your question thanks charlie charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut as a quick follow up where are the next homeruns going to come from and this is more strategic beyond just jpmorgan but there are probably going to be more regional bank failures whether its this year or next year and opportunities to pick those up but what youre seeing is that private equity and family offices are setting up to jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12apr2024 participate in this next round of bank failures mnuchins buying of nycb is clearly to create a platform for rollups of failed banks and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations for bank holding companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks so do you think that these opportunities are going to be competed away by private credit and as part of that do you think the regulators are going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks so thats my question jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right okay charlie theres a lot in there and to be honest i just dont love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about bank failures you obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape im not going to bother debating that with you but i guess let me just try to say a couple of things doing my best to answer your question as we talked about earlier we have a lot of capital and as jamie says the capital is earnings in store and right now we dont see a lot of really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital but if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the basel iii endgame we will be well positioned to deploy it i think embedded there is also sort of a question about the fdic and the fdics attitude towards different types of bidders and obviously theres a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent forums and speeches on bank resolution and so on and so forth and i think probably we can all agree that its better all else equal for the system to have as much capital available and as many different types of capital available to ensure that things are stabilized if anything ever goes wrong but the mechanics of how you do that when youre talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated so i guess thats probably as much as i have on that charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut all right thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks operator we have no further questions
