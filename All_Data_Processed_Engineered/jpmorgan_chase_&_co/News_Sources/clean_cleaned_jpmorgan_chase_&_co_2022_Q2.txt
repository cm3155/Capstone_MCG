jpmorgan chase  co  jpmorgan chase has told the market what it needed to hear after holding steady with its forecast for net interest income when it released firstquarter earnings last month even as the federal reserve became increasingly hawkish the bank in an investor day presentation monday raised that target to billionplus for excluding its volatile markets unit it also sees a path based on what it anticipates for the fourth quarter to a future annual rate of around billion that alone will likely reassure investors that lenders arent going to miss out on the upside of rising rates with worries about the pace of loan growth and deposit competition not erasing that advantage bank stocks generally were surging on monday with jpmorgan shares on track for their best day since with a gain the kbw nasdaq bank index was up nearly almost triple the rebound in the broader sp still investors shouldnt get too far ahead of themselves even with this interest income expectation jpmorgan didnt alter its mediumterm target for return on tangible common equity a key measure of bank profitability chief executive jamie dimon said there was a very good chance the bank will achieve that level this year and it could hit it next year in a benign environment the banks pricetotangible book multiple is just over times according to factset it was trading at more than two times entering the pandemic and reached times last year whether that means the stock is discounted depends on a broader perspective on returns taking into account some macro factors partly out of the banks control for one mr dimon noted that the bank is overearning on credit right now losing around billion annually on chargeoffs or about half of what he said a normalized level might be the bank expects this to eventually normalize though it isnt anticipating a rapid reversion it says it may take until closer to the end of next year to get to prepandemic net chargeoff rates still under current accounting rules the bank may have to adjust its loanloss reserves earlier based in part on worstcase macroeconomic scenarios then there are rising regulatory capital requirements which influence the denominator part of return on equity the bank said it expects to manage to a higher minimum capital ratio target as of the start of though it can get there via earnings growth and so it wouldnt have to raise capital and dilute shareholders this may limit cash available for share buybacks that would normally boost book value per share that is a factor in bookvalue multiples the bank also spent significant time on monday explaining the payoff for its spending on investments in areas such as cloud computing and travel services but in this frightening market investors might not be in any mood to pay for potential such a cautious spendconscious mindset might have factored into the largely symbolic nonbinding rejection of the banks compensation plan for mr dimon and other top executives in a shareholder vote last week

to see whats ahead its a different strong economy mr dimon said if we go into a recession it may be different from other recessions so far though jpmorgan executives said they have seen no signs of looming trouble in early loandelinquency numbers and while the economic forecast has worsened they arent expecting to add significantly to their loanloss reserves in the current quarter after
