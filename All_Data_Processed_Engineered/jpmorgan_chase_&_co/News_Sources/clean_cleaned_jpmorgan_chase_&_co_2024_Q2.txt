musk and jpmorgans dimon try for fresh start after feud elon musk and jamie dimon have been patching things up the two business titans have been feuding since a fallout musks companies including tesla and spacex have spurned jpmorgan chase bankers and the nations largest bank hasnt wooed his business empire they have been moving toward a fresh start since a march detente when musk attended an inaugural jpmorgantechnology conference and talked on stage with dimon before a crowd that included microsoft chief executive satya nadella and sam altman the chief executive of openai afterward the door appeared open for jpmorgan and musks empire to find a way to work together in the future people familiar with the relationship said there remains a significant roadblock jpmorgan and tesla are still in a legal battle that started three years ago over million that jpmorgan has said tesla should pay for a series of trades but the progress is notable just over a year ago it seemed unlikely jpmorgan and musk would ever find a way to work together in the case of jpmorgan tesla um has a very negative relationship with jpmorgan musk testified in a court case in january jpmorgan hates tesla in a nutshell musk is the kind of client jpmorgan and dimon typically covet one of the worlds richest people musk is a potential client for wealthmanagement advice and runs a collection of companies that could use banking fundraising and dealmaking services he brings challenges loans other banks made for his twitter acquisition have lost significant value but most bankers are eager to stay on his good side for fees from his transactions and potential initial public offerings such as his rocket company spacex in may jpmorgan hired eric gray a los angelesbased wealth manager to the ultrawealthy musk has been one of his clients according to people familiar with their relationship for his empire musk could gain access to the bank with the deepest pockets in the us plus a wider network of advisers and services those mutual interests are what has made the feud so unusual on wall street and why a change of heart could open the door to lucrative solutions for both sides jpmorgan was never teslas most important adviser that role has been held by goldman sachs and morgan stanley but the carmaker did use some banking services the relationship started fraying around musk wanted jpmorgan one of the countrys biggest auto lenders to underwrite leases for teslas electric vehicles bank executives balked unsure how to value the life of the car batteries the wall street journal has reported musk was infuriated by the decision and called the banks thenhead of consumer banking screaming and threatening to pull teslas business people familiar with the matter said musks message ended with f you one of the people said dimon was angry he called musk and told him that jpmorgan wouldnt be bullied the people said in the ensuing years musk has worked closely with many of the banks competitors and his empire has expanded to six companies goldman has been paid nearly million in fees from tesla and spacex since according to dealogic jpmorgan worked on the other side of musk representing twitter when musk acquired the company personally jpmorgan used to have all of teslas commercial banking business musk testified last year in an unrelated lawsuit but when i asked jamie dimon at one point for support with a tesla automotive leasing line he declined to support tesla so i withdrew all commercial banking business from jpmorgan which to say the least made jpmorgan hate tesla and me very much the animosity became public in late when jpmorgan took the unusual step of suing tesla and musk over million the bank said tesla owed the money for a trade jpmorgan helped arrange in tesla countersued saying jpmorgan was mad in part because it didnt get any of musks business if jpm doesnt withdraw their lawsuit i will give them a onestar review on yelp musk told the journal at the time the lawsuits are ongoing and it is unclear if an improving dimonmusk relationship would change that there had been signs of a thaw in the past year in november dimon was asked his thoughts about musk at the new york timess dealbook conference hes obviously a brilliant human being and making unbelievable contributions to mankind but he you know comes with pluses and minuses dimon responded in january musk complimented dimon for making positive comments about some of donald trumps positions jamie dimon says it well musk tweeted in march jpmorgan held a technology summit at a resort in big sky mont jpmorgan and other banks commonly host conferences and group gatherings but this was the banks first version of a superelite techfocused gathering as a big draw they landed an unlikely speaker musk for more than an hour dimon and musk spoke about an array of topics from israel to artificial intelligence and us politics the two men seemed to have a good rapport on stage with musk often being deferential to dimons views according to people familiar with the event musk also had his young son x with him at the event one of the people said the event was organized by jpmorgans head of technology investment banking madhu namburi and had celebrities in attendance including tom brady serena williams katy perry and john legend musk also visited dimons suite at the resort for what was meant to be a short conversation it lasted for more than an hour following the event dimon decided the bank could try to resume doing business with musk the people said former customers of first republic pan chase service first republic bank had a knack for making customers feel special its new owner isnt getting such rave reviews over memorial day weekend all first republic customers were moved over into jpmorgan chase accounts a transfer of some accounts on social media and in interviews dozens of former first republic customers are complaining about their first experiences with jpmorgan chase customers werent able to make payments with their debit and credit cards after the migration others reported multihour waits for customersupport agents many of whom werent able to help them solve their problems across silicon valley where first republic was legendary for its concierge services personal bankers umbrellas and cheap mortgages people like tech executive pieter nel were shocked to realize that they are now runofthemill chase customers we were all used to legendary service and dedicated bankers said nel who used first republic for his personal banking needs folks like me generally fly business class stay in four or fivestar hotels and are used to a level of service in every other aspect of our lives except not with banking now that first republic is gone any transfer of hundreds of thousands of bank accounts is likely to be fraught with bumps and technical mishaps bank customers often take to social media to complain about the slightest bugs making limited issues appear widespread and every day banking customers experience frustration with passwords security and technology that amounts to user error a jpmorgan spokesperson said that the bank successfully executed the migration and that most customers didnt have any problems accessing their bank accounts after memorial day by tuesday morning the first business day all of our systems were fully operational the spokesperson said in fact it was our smoothest major migration ever in early first republic collapsed in a bank run when customers yanked billions of dollars in deposits part of a broader panic in regional banks federal regulators seized the bank and jpmorgan won an auction to acquire it the deal was premised on the idea that jpmorgan would be able to tap in to a network of affluent silicon valley entrepreneurs and offer them wealthmanagement and commercialbanking services part of a push to target wealthy customers jpmorgan executives were eager to learn from new employees what made first republic tick a risk to the deal was customers wouldnt hang around if chase got it wrong but some deeppocketed and longtime first republic customers said they arent impressed with how chase has handled the migration they said that the fivestar approach at first republic feels painfully absent as evidenced by long waits for help over the phone and technical glitches that support agents cant easily solve let alone the missing umbrellas and cookies roelof botha an executive at venturecapital firm sequoia capital railed against the handoff on tuesday evening despite months of planning jpmorgan is failing miserably at the simple task of transferring former first republic bank accounts he wrote in a post on x that includes the embarrassment of having your card declined for transactions despite assurances that everything would work smoothly silicon valley bigwigs arent the only ones having problems david howey owner of a selfstorage company in corte madera calif said he hasnt been able to access around he kept in a small business account at first republic he said that he called chase but that customer service representatives couldnt locate his account as most banks are crap i made sure that i kept some money in other accounts so ill be ok he said daniel morgan managing principal of a realestate company in southern california said that he is planning to move his accounts to citizens private bank he said he spent over six hours each day on memorial day weekend trying to access his accounts and set up autopay on some construction loans it took him more than four hours to reach a customerservice representative on the phone when he got someone the representative told him he had called the wrong part of the bank he had to wait an additional two hours to reach the commercialloan servicing department weeks earlier a private banker at citizens reached out to morgan and said that his bank could offer his company nearly all of the same services he got at chase but with a personal touch a lot of us feel a level of gratitude for what first republic did for us they took a lot of risks on us as entrepreneurs morgan said not all former first republic customers are preparing to cut ties with the uss biggest bank don tepman a new yorkbased entrepreneur in the realestate industry wasnt able to access several business accounts this week but he acknowledged it was because he had procrastinated on signing up for a new login plus he feels better than customers did last year when they worried about the collapse of first republic people are sad to see the first republic brand go away he said the migration has been a bit inconvenient for now but i am not actually worried that our money is not going to be there exchange
