capital ratio requirements the firms basel iii standardized riskbased ratios are currently more binding than the basel iii advanced riskbased ratios basel iii establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk rwa and market risk rwa and in the case of basel iii advanced operational risk rwa key differences in the calculation of credit risk rwa between the standardized and advanced approaches are that for basel iii advanced credit risk rwa is based on risksensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters whereas for basel iii standardized credit risk rwa is generally based on supervisory riskweightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class market risk rwa is calculated on a generally consistent basis

commitments the firm uses lendingrelated financial instruments such as commitments including revolving credit facilities and guarantees to address the financing needs of its clients the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced extended cancelled or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring as a result the firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lendingrelated commitments is representative of the firms expected

marketable debt or equity securities because of this collateralization no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables to manage its credit risk the firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral or to reduce positions when appropriate these receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the firms consolidated balance sheets derivative contracts derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices the firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its marketmaking activities including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables the firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure the nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the firm is exposed for otc derivatives the firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty for exchangetraded derivatives etd such as futures and options and cleared overthecounter otc cleared derivatives the firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant ccp where possible the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements the percentage of the firms otc derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements excluding foreign exchange spot trades which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily was approximately and at december and respectively refer to note for additional information on the firms use of collateral agreements and further discussion of derivative contracts counterparties and settlement types the fair value of derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were billion and billion at december and respectively the increase was primarily driven by higher foreign exchange as a result of market movements derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the firm in addition the firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the clients exposure is in the firms favor for these purposes the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the lcr rule in managements view the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the lcr rule the benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty the firm also holds additional collateral primarily cash g7 government securities other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities and corporate debt and equity securities delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions as well as collateral related to contracts that have a nondaily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date

positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterpartys capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time to the extent that these correlations are identified the firm may adjust the cva associated with a particular counterpartys avg the firm risk manages exposure to changes in cva by entering into credit derivative contracts as well as interest rate foreign exchange equity and commodity derivative contracts the

value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure the firm calculates on a

benefits where applicable peak represents a conservative measure of potential derivative exposure including the benefit of collateral to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a confidence level over the life of the transaction peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting credit limits for derivative contracts senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure including the benefit of collateral on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used as an input for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk finally avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firms derivative exposure including the benefit of collateral at future time periods avg over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and cva as further described below the fair value of the firms derivative receivables incorporates cva to reflect the credit quality of counterparties cva is based on the firms avg to a counterparty and the counterpartys credit spread in the credit derivatives market the firm believes that active risk management is

entities in the purchased cds the contractual terms of the cds which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the firm and the maturity of the firms cds

environment the firm has a single var framework used as a basis for calculating risk management var and regulatory var the framework is employed across the firm using historical simulation based on data for the previous months the frameworks approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future the firm believes the use of risk management var provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the lobs and corporate and along with other market risk measures provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events the firms risk management var is calculated assuming a oneday holding period and an expected tailloss methodology which approximates a confidence level risk management var provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses var results are reported to senior management the board of directors and regulators underlying the overall var model framework are individual var models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk factors andor product types to capture material market risks as part of the firms risk management framework comprehensive var model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk these var models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems the var model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the firm level as var is based on historical data it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses in addition based on their reliance on available historical data limited time horizons and other factors var measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions for certain products specific risk parameters are not captured in var due to the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data the firm uses proxies to estimate the var for these and other products when daily time series are not available it is likely that using an actual pricebased time series for these products if available would affect the var results presented the firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures

backtesting purposes the gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the firms reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue such as those associated with the execution of new transactions ie intraday clientdriven trading and intraday risk management activities fees commissions other valuation adjustments and net interest income these excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day the definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under basel iii capital rules a backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily risk management var for the prior day under the firms risk management var methodology assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation the firm would expect to incur var backtesting exceptions five times every trading days on average the number of var backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the months of historical data used in the var calculation for the months ended december the firm posted backtesting gains on of the days and observed var backtesting exceptions firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which fixed income markets and equity markets posted losses as disclosed in cib markets revenue

reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior stress testing reflects the risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously stress testing measures the firms vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but possible economic and market scenarios the results are used to understand the exposures responsible for those potential losses and are measured against limits the firms stress framework covers market risk sensitive positions in the lobs and corporate the framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market sell offs assuming significant changes in market factors such as credit spreads equity prices interest rates currency rates and commodity prices and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of hypothetical economic and market scenarios the firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in specific asset classes and geographies including how the event may impact multiple market factors simultaneously scenarios also incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different products the flexibility in the stress framework allows the firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes against possible future stress events stress testing results are reported periodically to senior management of the firm as appropriate stress scenarios are governed by the overall stress framework under the oversight of market risk management and the models to calculate the stress results are subject to the firms estimations and model risk management policy the firmwide market risk stress methodology committee reviews and approves changes to stress testing methodology and scenarios across the firm significant changes to the framework are escalated to senior management as appropriate the firms stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the firms ccar and other stress test results which are reported periodically to the board of directors in addition stress testing results are incorporated into the firms risk appetite framework and are reported periodically to the board risk committee profit and loss drawdowns profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance a profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its yeartodate peak level earningsatrisk the effect of interest rate exposure on the firms reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the firms significant market risks interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the firms traditional banking activities which include extension of loans and credit facilities taking deposits issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio refer to the table on page for a summary by lob and corporate identifying positions included in

interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the ctc cro this risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk the firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives structural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of factors including differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments differences in the amounts of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time differences in the amounts by which shortterm and longterm market interest rates change for example changes in the slope of the yield curve the impact of changes in the maturity of various assets liabilities or offbalance sheet instruments as interest rates change the firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated firmwide basis business units transfer their interest rate risk to treasury and cio through funds transfer pricing which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be riskmanaged in financial markets these elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest contractual principal payment schedules expected prepayment experience interest rate reset dates and maturities rate indices used for repricing and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products one way that the firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earningsatrisk earningsatrisk estimates the firms interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario it is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees the baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits pricing assumptions the firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars and other currencies nonus dollar currencies these simulations primarily include retained loans jpmorgan chase co2022 form 10k deposits deposits with banks investment securities longterm debt and any related interest rate hedges and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management var and other sensitivitybased measures as described on page earningsatrisk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline over the following months utilizing multiple assumptions these scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both shortterm and longterm rates by an equal amount a steeper yield curve involving holding shortterm rates constant and increasing longterm rates and a flatter yield curve involving increasing shortterm rates and holding longterm rates constant or holding shortterm rates constant and decreasing long term rates these scenarios consider many different factors including the impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates forecasted balance sheet as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates the time since origination and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the firms earningsatrisk the baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the reversal of quantitative easing that are highly uncertain and require management judgment therefore the actual amount of deposits held by the firm at any particular time could be impacted by actions the federal reserve may take as part of monetary policy including through the use of the reverse repurchase facility in addition there are other factors that impact the amount of deposits held at the firm such as the level of loans across the industry and competition for deposits the pricing sensitivity of deposits known as deposit betas represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates the deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid due to repricing lags and other factors the firms earningsatrisk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the firms balance sheet changes in market conditions improvements in the firms simulation and other factors the firm is currently evaluating the modeling of repricing lags for deposits in its earningsatrisk scenarios incorporating repricing lags in the current environment would significantly affect the us dollar

approach and does not represent the firms view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows the increase in exposure to germany and the decrease in exposure to the uk were primarily due to changes in cash placements with the central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management activities the decrease in exposure to australia was driven by reductions in cash placed with the central bank of australia and government debt securities due to clientdriven marketmaking activities and lower client cash deposits resulting from higher interest rates as of december exposure to russia was approximately million this amount excludes certain deposits placed on

driver of risk that may impact existing types of risks managed by the firm climate risk is categorized into physical risk and transition risk physical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss associated with a changing climate acute physical risk drivers include the increased frequency or severity of climate and weather events such as floods wildfires and tropical storms chronic physical risk drivers include more gradual shifts in the climate such as rising sea levels persistent changes in precipitation levels and increases in average ambient temperatures transition risk refers to the financial and economic implications associated with a societal adjustment to a lowcarbon economy transition risk drivers include possible changes in public policy adoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences transition risks may also be influenced by changes in the physical climate organization and management the firm has a climate risk management function that is

addition operational risk and compliance assesses operational risks through quantitative means including operational riskbased capital and estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions the primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is the loss distribution approach lda statistical model which simulates the frequency and severity of future operational risk loss projections based on historical data the lda model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a oneyear time horizon at a confidence level the lda model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced as required under the basel iii capital framework the firms operational riskbased capital methodology which

risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs the firm uses models and other analytical and judgmentbased estimations across various businesses and functions the estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk assessing regulatory capital requirements conducting stress testing evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making business decisions a dedicated independent function model risk governance and review mrgr defines and governs the firms policies relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and judgmentbased estimations such as those used in risk management budget forecasting and capital planning and analysis the governance of analytical and judgmentbased estimations within mrgrs scope follows a consistent approach which is used for models as described in detail below model risks are owned by the users of the models within the firm based on the specific purposes of such models users and developers of models are responsible for developing implementing and testing their models as well as referring models to mrgr for review and approval once models have been approved model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis model users and developers may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and in product and market developments as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity the exposure associated with the model and the firms reliance on the model this tiering is subject to the approval of mrgr in its review of a model mrgr considers whether the model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used when reviewing a model mrgr analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions and may perform or require additional testing including backtesting of model outcomes model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within mrgr based on the relevant model tier under the firms estimations and model risk management policy mrgr reviews and approves new models as well as material changes to existing models prior to their use in certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the firms policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval mrgr may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim these actions will depend on the model and may include for example limitation of trading activity while models are inherently imprecise the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment this is particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed as the firm experienced during the early stages of the covid19 pandemic this increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that the firm may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case refer to critical accounting estimates used by the firm on pages and note for a summary of modelbased valuations and other valuation techniques jpmorgan chase co2022 form 10k critical accounting estimates used by the firm jpmorgan chases accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results the firms most complex accounting estimates require managements judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities the firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods including any judgments made as part of such methods are wellcontrolled independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period the methods used and judgments made reflect among other factors the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies which may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner the firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate the following is a brief description of the firms critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments allowance for credit losses the firms allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the firms financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses comprises the allowance for loan losses which covers the firms retained loan portfolios scored and riskrated the allowance for lendingrelated commitments and the allowance for credit losses on investment securities the allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts incorporation of historical loss experience assessment of risk characteristics assignment of risk ratings valuation of collateral and the determination of remaining expected life refer to note and note for further information on these judgments as well as the firms policies and methodologies used to determine the firms allowance for credit losses one of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the firms allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eightquarter forecast period within the firms methodology the eightquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables mevs that are relevant for exposures across the firm with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables the specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography key mevs for the consumer portfolio include regional us unemployment rates hpi and us real gdp key mevs for the wholesale portfolio include us real gdp us unemployment us equity prices us interest rates corporate credit spreads oil prices commercial real estate prices and hpi changes in the firms assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast the firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments the central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of mevs but differed in the levels paths and peakstroughs of those variables over the eightquarter forecast period for example compared to the firms central scenario shown on page and in note the firms relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated us unemployment rate averaging approximately higher over the eightquarter forecast with a peak difference of approximately in the fourth quarter of lower us real gdp with a slower recovery remaining nearly lower at the end of the eightquarter forecast with a peak difference of approximately in the fourth quarter of and lower national hpi with a peak difference of approximately in the third quarter of this analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses for a number of reasons including the allowance as of december reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios the impacts of changes in many mevs are both interrelated and nonlinear so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses to demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of december the jpmorgan chase co2022 form 10k managements discussion and analysis firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the firms allowance for credit losses the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences an increase of approximately million for residential real estate loans and lendingrelated commitments an increase of approximately billion for credit card loans an increase of approximately billion for wholesale loans and lendingrelated commitments this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on thencurrent circumstances and conditions recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain particularly in light of the recent economic conditions the firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended december fair value jpmorgan chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value the majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives structured note products and certain securities financing agreements certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including certain mortgage home equity and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral assets measured at fair value the following table includes the firms assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy refer to note for further information december in millions except ratios federal funds sold and securities purchased

firm assets level assets at fair value as a percentage of total firm assets at fair value a total assets at fair value total level assets a for purposes of the table above the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments however the billion of derivative receivables classified as level does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset the level balances would be reduced if netting were applied including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral jpmorgan chase co2022 form 10k valuation details of the firms processes for determining fair value are set out in note estimating fair value requires the application of judgment the type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the firm for instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level of the fair value hierarchy judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels and in arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use second the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including for example transaction details yield curves interest rates prepayment speed default rates volatilities correlations prices such as commodity equity or debt prices valuations of comparable instruments foreign exchange rates and credit curves refer to note for a further discussion of the valuation of level instruments including unobservable inputs used for instruments classified in levels and management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality the firms creditworthiness market funding rates liquidity considerations unobservable parameters and for portfolios that meet specified criteria the size of the net open risk position the judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole in periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates particularly for positions that are less liquid refer to note for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the firm imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position furthermore while the firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios the firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value the use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date refer to note for a detailed discussion of the firms valuation process and hierarchy and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments goodwill impairment under us gaap goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually the firms process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in note management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment the goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing for the year ended december the firm reviewed current economic conditions estimated market cost of equity as well as actual business results and projections of business performance based on such reviews the firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of december for each of the reporting units fair value exceeded carrying value by at least and there was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations the projections for the firms reporting units are consistent with managements current business outlook assumptions in the short term and the firms best estimates of longterm growth and return on equity in the longer term where possible the firm uses thirdparty and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates refer to note for additional information on goodwill including the goodwill impairment assessment as of december credit card rewards liability jpmorgan chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program generally there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn nor do the points expire and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards including cash predominantly in the form of account credits gift cards and travel the firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders the liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points this liability was billion and billion at december and respectively and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets the increase in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on increased cardholder spending and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout the rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate rr and cost per point cpp assumptions the rr assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by customers that will be redeemed over the life of the account the cpp assumption is used to estimate the cost of future point redemptions these assumptions are evaluated periodically considering historical actuals cardholder redemption behavior and management judgment updates jpmorgan chase co2022 form 10k established the valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the firm determines that based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable as of december management has determined it is more likely than not that the firm will realize its deferred tax assets net of the existing valuation allowance the firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when new information becomes available including changes in tax law and regulations and interactions with taxing authorities uncertain tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot
