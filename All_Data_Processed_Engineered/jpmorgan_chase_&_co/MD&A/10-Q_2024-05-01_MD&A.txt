respondents in numerous evolving legal proceedings including private proceedings public proceedings government investigations regulatory enforcement matters and the matters described below the litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings by both governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations these legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication arbitration or investigation and involve each of the firms lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust securities and consumer protection claims some of which present novel legal theories the firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of reserves established for its legal proceedings is from to approximately billion at march this estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made for certain matters the firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made as of that date the firms estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment given the number variety and varying stages of the proceedings including the fact that many are in preliminary stages the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants including the firm whose share of liability if any has yet to be determined the numerous yetunresolved issues in many of the proceedings including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims and the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings including where the firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities and those assumptions prove to be incorrect in addition the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the firm did not take into account in its estimate because the firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote accordingly the firms estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time and actual losses may vary significantly set forth below are descriptions of the firms

in march the court granted defendants motion to dismiss the federal claims and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state claims trading venues investigations the firm has been responding to government inquiries regarding its processes to inventory trading venues and confirm the completeness of certain data fed to trade surveillance platforms the firm selfidentified that certain trading and order data through the cib was not feeding into its trade surveillance platforms the firm has completed enhancements to the cibs venue inventory and data completeness controls and other remediation is underway the firm has also performed a review of the data not originally surveilled which is nearly complete and has not identified any employee misconduct harm to clients or the market while the identified gaps represent a fraction of the overall activity across the cib the data gap on one venue which largely consisted of sponsored client access activity was significant the firm is dedicated to maintaining rigorous controls and continuously enhancing the reliability of its trade infrastructure in march the firm entered into resolutions with the occ and the board of governors of the frb that require the firm to among other things complete its remediation engage an independent consultant and pay aggregate civil penalties of approximately million the firm also expects to enter into a resolution with a third us regulator that will require the firm to among other things pay a civil penalty of million after offsets for amounts paid to the occ and frb the firm does not expect any disruption of service to clients as a result of these resolutions in addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings the firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future the firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings in accordance with the provisions of us gaap for contingencies the firm accrues for a litigationrelated liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves and makes adjustments in such reserves upward or downward as appropriate based on managements best judgment after consultation with counsel the firms legal expense was million and million for the three months ended march and respectively there is no assurance that the firms litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery the firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses fines penalties or consequences related to those matters jpmorgan chase believes based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the firms consolidated financial condition the firm notes however that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences as a result the outcome of a particular matter may be material to jpmorgan chases operating results for a particular period depending on among other factors the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of jpmorgan chases income for that period
