financial holding company the office of the comptroller of the currency occ establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the firms principal idi subsidiary jpmorgan chase bank na the us capital requirements generally follow the capital accord of the basel committee as amended from time to time basel iii overview the capital rules under basel iii establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active us bhcs and banks including the firm and jpmorgan chase bank na the minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by bhcs and banks is determined by calculating rwa which are onbalance sheet assets and offbalance sheet exposures weighted according to risk under the rules currently in effect two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating rwa a standardized approach basel iii standardized and an advanced approach basel iii advanced for each of these riskbased capital ratios the capital adequacy of the firm is evaluated against the lower of the standardized or advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements in july the federal reserve the occ and the fdic released a proposal to amend the riskbased capital framework entitled regulatory capital rule amendments applicable to large banking organizations and to banking organizations with significant trading activity which is referred to in this form 10k as us basel iii proposal under the proposal changes to the framework would include replacement of the advanced approach with an expanded riskbased approach which would not permit the use of internal models for the calculation of rwa other than for market risk in addition the stress capital buffer requirement would be applicable to both the expanded risk based approach and the standardized approach the proposal would significantly revise riskbased capital requirements for all banks with assets of billion or more including the firm and other us gsibs the proposed effective date is july with a threeyear transition period applicable to the expanded riskbased approach based on the firms understanding of the proposal as applied to its consolidated balance sheets as of june the reference date for a special data collection exercise conducted by the federal reserve the estimated impact at the end of the transition period would increase rwa by approximately which would result in an approximately increase to cet1 capital necessary to meet the firms cet1 ratio requirement all else equal these estimates do not reflect any actions that the firm may take to mitigate the impact of the rule as currently proposed pending the finalization of the us basel iii proposal the firm expects that it will continue to build capital above the current levels and therefore the cet1 target of previously set by the firm which was with respect to the current standardized rwa measure is no longer meaningful the firms quarterly capital ratios will vary dependent on market conditions and other factors under the requirements of the us basel iii proposal the new expanded riskbased approach when fully phasedin would be the firms binding constraint the current basel iii rules establish capital requirements for calculating credit risk rwa and market risk rwa and in the case of basel iii advanced operational risk rwa key differences in the calculation of credit risk rwa between the standardized and advanced approaches are that for basel iii advanced credit risk rwa is based on risksensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters whereas for basel iii standardized credit risk rwa is generally based on supervisory risk weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class market risk rwa is generally calculated consistently between basel iii standardized and basel iii advanced in addition to the rwa calculated under these approaches the firm may supplement such amounts to jpmorgan chase co2023 form 10k incorporate management judgment and feedback from its regulators as of december the advanced total capital ratio became the most binding constraint for the firms basel iii riskbased ratios primarily reflecting the reduction in the stress capital buffer requirement however as of december with respect to the cet1 and tier riskbased ratios the standardized ratios are more binding than the advanced ratios basel iii also includes a requirement for advanced approaches banking organizations including the firm to calculate its slr as of the fourth quarter of the firms slr became more binding than the basel iii risk based ratios primarily reflecting the reduction in the stress capital buffer requirement with the increase in the gsib surcharge in the first quarter of the firm expects the riskbased ratios to revert to being more binding than the slr refer to page for additional information on gsib surcharge and page for additional information on slr other key regulatory developments gsib surcharge in july the federal reserve also released a proposal to amend the calculation of the gsib surcharge if adopted as proposed these amendments would require the firm to assess its gsib surcharge on an annual basis using the average of the quarterly surcharge calculations throughout the calendar year with daily averaging required for certain measures within the surcharge calculation surcharge increments would be reduced from bps to bps and there would also be other technical amendments to the method calculation the proposed amendments would revise riskbased capital requirements for the firm and other us gsibs and would become effective two calendar quarters after the adoption of the final rule refer to risk based capital regulatory

managements discussion and analysis lendingrelated commitments the firm uses lendingrelated financial instruments such as commitments including revolving credit facilities and guarantees to address the financing needs of its clients the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced extended cancelled or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring as a result the firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lendingrelated commitments is representative of the firms expected future credit exposure or funding requirements refer to note for further information on wholesale lendingrelated commitments receivables from

including cash on deposit and primarily liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities to manage its credit risk the firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral or to reduce positions when appropriate credit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the shortterm nature of the activity the fair value of collateral held and the firms right to call for and the borrowers obligation to provide additional margin when the fair value of the collateral declines because of these mitigating factors these receivables generally do not require an allowance for credit losses however if in managements judgment an allowance for credit losses is required the firm estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower default these receivables are

netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the firm in addition the firm holds liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the clients exposure is in the firms favor for these purposes the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the lcr rule in managements view the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the lcr rule the benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative

exposure net of collateral of exposure net of collateral exposure net of collateral of exposure net of collateral is broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterpartys capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time to the extent that these correlations are identified the firm may adjust the cva associated with a particular

a conservative measure of potential derivative exposure including the benefit of collateral to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a confidence level over the life of the transaction peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting credit limits for derivative contracts senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure including the benefit of collateral on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used as an input for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk finally avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firms derivative exposures including the benefit of collateral at future time periods avg over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to

underlying the overall var model framework are individual var models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk factors andor product types to capture material market risks as part of the firms risk management framework comprehensive var model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk these var models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems the var model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the firm level as var is based on historical data it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses in addition based on their reliance on available historical data limited time horizons and other factors var measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions for certain products specific risk parameters are not captured in var due to the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data the firm uses proxies to estimate the var

tool used to assess risk while var reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior stress testing reflects the risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously stress testing measures the firms vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but possible economic and market scenarios the results are used to understand the exposures responsible for those potential losses and are measured against limits the firms stress framework covers market risk sensitive positions in the lobs and corporate the framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market selloffs assuming significant changes in market factors such as credit spreads equity prices interest rates currency rates and commodity prices and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of hypothetical economic and market scenarios the firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in specific asset classes and geographies including how the event may impact multiple market factors simultaneously scenarios also incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different products the flexibility in the stress framework allows the firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes against possible future stress events stress testing results are reported periodically to senior management of the firm as appropriate stress scenarios are governed by the overall stress framework under the oversight of market risk management and the models to calculate the stress results are subject to the firms estimations and model risk management policy the firmwide market risk stress methodology committee reviews and approves changes to stress testing methodology and scenarios across the firm significant changes to the framework are escalated to senior management as appropriate the firms stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the firms ccar and other stress test results which are reported periodically to the board of directors in addition stress testing results are incorporated into the firms risk appetite framework and are reported periodically to the board risk committee profit and loss drawdowns profit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance a profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its yeartodate peak level structural interest rate risk management the effect of interest rate exposure on the firms reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the firms significant market risks interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities which are included in var but also from the firms traditional banking activities which include extension of loans and credit facilities taking deposits issuing debt as well as the investment securities portfolio and associated derivative instruments refer to the table on page for a summary by lob and corporate identifying positions included in earningsatrisk governance the ctc risk committee establishes the firms interest rate risk management policy and related limits which are subject to approval by the board risk committee treasury and cio working in partnership with the lobs calculates the firms structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management including the ctc risk committee in addition oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the ctc cro this risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk including limits related to earningsat risk and economic value sensitivity the firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives key risk drivers and risk management process structural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of factors including differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments differences in the amounts of assets liabilities and off balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time differences in the amounts by which shortterm and long term market interest rates change for example changes in the slope of the yield curve the impact of changes in the maturity of various assets liabilities or offbalance sheet instruments as interest rates change the firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated firmwide basis business units transfer their interest rate risk to treasury and cio through funds transfer pricing which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be riskmanaged in financial markets these elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest contractual principal payment schedules expected prepayment experience interest rate reset dates and maturities rate indices used for repricing and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products earningsatrisk one way that the firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earningsatrisk earningsatrisk estimates the firms interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario it is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees the baseline uses market interest rates and jpmorgan chase co2023 form 10k in the case of deposits pricing assumptions the firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars and other currencies nonus dollar currencies these simulations primarily include retained loans deposits deposits with banks investment securities long term debt and any related interest rate hedges and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management var and other sensitivitybased measures as described on page these simulations exclude hedges of exposure from nonus dollar foreign exchange risk arising from the firms capital investments the inclusion of the hedges in these simulations would increase us dollar sensitivities and decrease nonus dollar sensitivities refer to nonus dollar foreign exchange risk on page for more information earningsatrisk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline over the following months utilizing multiple assumptions these scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both shortterm and long term rates by an equal amount a steeper yield curve involving holding shortterm rates constant and increasing longterm rates and a flatter yield curve involving increasing shortterm rates and holding longterm rates constant or holding shortterm rates constant and decreasing longterm rates these scenarios consider many different factors including the impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates forecasted balance sheet as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates the time since origination and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the firms earningsatrisk the baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the reversal of quantitative easing that are highly uncertain and require management judgment therefore the actual amount of deposits held by the firm at any particular time could be impacted by actions the federal reserve may take as part of monetary policy including through the use of the reverse repurchase facility in addition there are other factors that impact the amount of deposits held at the firm such as the level of loans across the industry and competition for deposits the pricing sensitivity of deposits known as deposit betas represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates as part of the firms continuous evaluation and periodic enhancements to its earningsatrisk calculations the firm updated its model in the second quarter of to incorporate deposit repricing lags impacting both consumer and wholesale deposits the model change incorporated observed pricing and customer behavior in both rising and falling interest rate environments actual deposit rates paid may differ from the modeled assumptions primarily due to customer behavior and competition for deposits the firm performs sensitivity analyses of the assumptions used in earningsatrisk scenarios including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts of deposit balances both of which are especially significant in the case of consumer deposits the results of these sensitivity analyses are reported to the ctc risk committee and the board risk committee the firms earningsatrisk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the firms balance sheet changes in market conditions improvements in the firms simulation and other factors while a relevant measure of the firms interest rate exposure the

estimations and model risk management estimations and model risk a subcategory of operational risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs the firm uses models and other analytical and judgment based estimations across various businesses and functions the estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk assessing regulatory capital requirements conducting stress testing evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making business decisions a dedicated independent function model risk governance and review mrgr defines and governs the firms policies relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and judgmentbased estimations such as those used in risk management budget forecasting and capital planning and analysis the governance of analytical and judgmentbased estimations within mrgrs scope follows a consistent approach which is used for models as described in detail below model risks are owned by the users of the models within the lobs and corporate based on the specific purposes of such models users and developers of models are responsible for developing implementing and testing their models as well as referring models to mrgr for review and approval once models have been approved model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis model users and developers may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the relevant portfolios and in product and market developments as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities models are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity the exposure associated with the model and the firms reliance on the model this tiering is subject to the approval of mrgr in its review of a model mrgr considers whether the model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used when reviewing a model mrgr analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions and may perform or require additional testing including backtesting of model outcomes model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within mrgr based on the relevant model tier under the firms estimations and model risk management policy mrgr reviews and approves new models as well as material changes to existing models prior to their use in certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the firms policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval mrgr may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim these actions will depend on the model and may include for example limitation of trading activity while models are inherently imprecise the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment this is particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed this increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that the firm may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case in addition the firm may experience increased uncertainty in its estimates if assets acquired differ from those used to develop the models refer to critical accounting estimates used by the firm on pages and note for a summary of modelbased valuations and other valuation techniques jpmorgan chase co2023 form 10k critical accounting estimates used by the firm jpmorgan chases accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results the firms most complex accounting estimates require managements judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities the firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods including any judgments made as part of such methods are wellcontrolled independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period the methods used and judgments made reflect among other factors the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies which may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner the firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate the following is a brief description of the firms critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments allowance for credit losses the firms allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the firms financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses generally comprises the allowance for loan losses which covers the firms retained loan portfolios scored and riskrated the allowance for lendingrelated commitments and the allowance for credit losses on investment securities the allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts incorporation of historical loss experience assessment of risk characteristics assignment of risk ratings valuation of collateral and the determination of remaining expected life refer to note and note for further information on these judgments as well as the firms policies and methodologies used to determine the firms allowance for credit losses one of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the firms allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eightquarter forecast period within the firms methodology the eightquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables mevs that are relevant for exposures across the firm with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables the specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography key mevs for the consumer portfolio include regional us unemployment rates and us hpi key mevs for the wholesale portfolio include us unemployment us real gdp us equity prices us interest rates us corporate credit spreads oil prices us commercial real estate prices and us hpi changes in the firms assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next as a result of the first republic acquisition the firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the loans acquired and lendingrelated commitments assumed as of may given the differences in risk rating methodologies for the first republic portfolio and the ongoing integration of products and systems the allowance for credit losses for the acquired wholesale portfolio was measured based on other facilities underwritten by the firm with similar risk characteristics and not based on modeled estimates as such the first republic wholesale portfolio is excluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity analysis below the allowance for credit losses for predominantly all of the consumer portfolio was measured using the firms modeled approach as the consumer portfolio is predominantly residential real estate that has more commonly defined risk characteristics including loan to value ratio and credit score and therefore is reflected in the sensitivity analysis below refer to note for additional information on the first republic acquisition it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast the firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments the central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of mevs but differed in the levels paths and peakstroughs of those variables over the eightquarter forecast period for example compared to the firms central scenario shown on page and in note the firms relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated us unemployment rate averaging approximately higher over the eight quarter forecast with a peak difference of approximately in the fourth quarter of lower us real gdp with a slower recovery remaining nearly lower at the end of the eightquarter forecast with a peak difference of jpmorgan chase co2023 form 10k managements discussion and analysis approximately in the fourth quarter of and lower hpi with a peak difference of approximately in the third quarter of this analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses for a number of reasons including the allowance as of december reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios the impacts of changes in many mevs are both interrelated and nonlinear so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses to demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of december the firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the firms allowance for credit losses the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences an increase of approximately million for residential real estate loans and lendingrelated commitments an increase of approximately billion for credit card loans an increase of approximately billion for wholesale loans and lendingrelated commitments this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on thencurrent circumstances and conditions recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain the firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended december fair value jpmorgan chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value the majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives structured note products and certain securities financing agreements certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including certain mortgage home equity and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral assets measured at fair value the following table includes the firms assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy refer to note for further information december in millions except ratios total assets at fair value total level

securities loans msrs other total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis total assets measured at fair value total firm assets level assets at fair value as a percentage of total firm assetsa level assets at fair value as a percentage of total firm assets at fair valuea a for purposes of the table above the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments however the billion of derivative receivables classified as level does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset the level balances would be reduced if netting were applied including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral jpmorgan chase co2023 form 10k valuation details of the firms processes for determining fair value are set out in note estimating fair value requires the application of judgment the type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the firm for instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level of the fair value hierarchy judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels and in arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use second the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including for example transaction details yield curves interest rates prepayment speeds default rates volatilities correlations prices such as commodity equity or debt prices valuations of comparable instruments foreign exchange rates and credit curves refer to note for a further discussion of the valuation of level instruments including unobservable inputs used for instruments classified in levels and management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality the firms creditworthiness market funding rates liquidity considerations unobservable parameters and for portfolios that meet specified criteria the size of the net open risk position the judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole in periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates particularly for positions that are less liquid refer to note for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the firm imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position furthermore while the firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios the firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value the use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date refer to note for a detailed discussion of the firms valuation process and hierarchy and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments goodwill impairment under us gaap goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually the firms process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in note management applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment the goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing for the year ended december the firm reviewed current economic conditions estimated market cost of equity as well as actual business results and projections of business performance based on such reviews the firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of december for each of the reporting units fair value exceeded carrying value by at least and there was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations the projections for the firms reporting units are consistent with managements current business outlook assumptions in the short term and the firms best estimates of long term growth and return on equity in the longer term where possible the firm uses thirdparty and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates refer to note for additional information on goodwill including the goodwill impairment assessment as of december credit card rewards liability jpmorgan chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program generally there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn nor do the points expire and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards including cash predominantly in the form of account credits gift cards and travel the firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders the liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points this liability was billion and billion at december and respectively and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets the increase in the liability was predominantly driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on higher spend and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout and to a lesser extent adjustments to certain reward program terms in the second quarter of the rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate rr and cost per point cpp assumptions the rr assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by customers that will be redeemed over the life of the account the cpp assumption is used to estimate the cost of future point redemptions these assumptions are evaluated periodically considering historical actuals cardholder jpmorgan chase co2023 form 10k deferred tax asset is not realizable a valuation allowance is established the valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the firm determines that based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable as of december management has determined it is more likely than not that the firm will realize its deferred tax assets net of the existing valuation allowance the firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when new information becomes available including changes in tax law and regulations and interactions with taxing authorities uncertain tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement it is possible that the reassessment of jpmorgan chases unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs although the firm believes that its estimates are reasonable the final tax amount could be different from the amounts reflected in the firms income tax provisions and accruals to the extent that the final outcome of these amounts is different than the amounts recorded such differences will generally impact the firms provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made the firms provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes the current and deferred tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known which could impact the firms effective tax rate refer to note for additional information on income taxes litigation reserves refer to note for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves managements discussion and analysis redemption behavior and management judgment updates to these assumptions will impact the rewards liability as of december a combined increase of basis points in rr and basis point in cpp would increase the rewards liability by approximately million income taxes jpmorgan chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates including us federal state and local and nonus jurisdictions these laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations to determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits jpmorgan chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the us and nonus tax jurisdictions jpmorgan chases interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the firm operates and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position these disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the firm operates jpmorgan chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters and the firm records additional unrecognized tax benefits as appropriate in addition the firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws legal interpretations and business strategies it is possible that revisions in the firms estimate of income taxes may materially affect the firms results of operations in any reporting period deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in managements judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the provision for income taxes in the period enacted the firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain tax attributes including net operating loss nol carryforwards and foreign tax credit ftc carryforwards the firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable these reviews include managements estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income including foreign source income and may incorporate various tax planning strategies including strategies that may
