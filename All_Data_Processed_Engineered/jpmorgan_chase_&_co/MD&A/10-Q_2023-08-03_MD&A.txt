contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under us gaap refer to note of jpmorgan chases s of the firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action a separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in march in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the board of directors to exercise adequate oversight over the firms compliance with records preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the firms subsidiaries and the sec and the cftc defendants motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending two shareholder derivative suits were filed in may and june respectively in the united states district court for the southern district of new york asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on the alleged failure of the board of directors and james dimon to exercise adequate oversight with respect to the firms provision of banking services to jeffrey epstein these actions allege that the shareholders are excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile these actions were consolidated and defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs in addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings the firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future the firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings in accordance with the provisions of us gaap for contingencies the firm accrues for a litigationrelated liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves and makes adjustments in such reserves upward or downward as appropriate based on managements best judgment after consultation with counsel the firms legal expense was million and million for the three months ended june and respectively there is no assurance that the firms litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery the firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses fines penalties or consequences related to those matters jpmorgan chase believes based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the firms consolidated financial condition the firm notes however that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences as a result the outcome of a particular matter may be material to jpmorgan chases operating results for a particular period depending on among other factors the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of jpmorgan chases income for that period note business segments the firm is managed on an lob basis there are four major reportable business segments consumer community banking corporate investment bank commercial banking and asset wealth management in addition there is a corporate segment the business segments are determined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the firms operating committee segment results are presented on a managed basis refer to segment results below and

on may jpmorgan chase acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of first republic bank the first republic acquisition from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as receiver for billion resulting in an estimated bargain purchase gain of billion recorded in other income the estimated bargain purchase gain represents the excess of the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired above the purchase price the first republic acquisition further advances the firms wealth management strategy and is complementary to the firms existing franchises the firm has determined that this acquisition constitutes a business combination under us gaap accordingly the initial recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally measured at their estimated fair values as of may the determination of those fair values required management to make certain marketbased assumptions about expected future cash flows discount rates and other valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition the firm believes that the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain purchase gain the firm and the fdic have not yet completed the settlement process under which the purchase price and the identification of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be finalized the finalization of this settlement process may impact the amount of the estimated bargain purchase gain the purchase and assumption agreement entered into with the fdic allows for final settlement to occur up to a year after the acquisition date in addition the purchase price and the estimated bargain purchase gain could change pending managements finalization of its acquisition date fair value estimates for certain of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as loans and commitments intangible assets and leases which may take place up to one year from the acquisition date as permitted by us gaap in connection with the first republic acquisition the firm and the fdic entered into two sharedloss agreements with respect to certain loans and lendingrelated commitments the sharedloss assets the commercial sharedloss agreement csla and the singlefamily sharedloss agreement sfsla the csla covers of credit losses on a paripassu basis over years with a subsequent 3year recovery period for certain acquired commercial loans and other real estate exposure the sfsla covers of credit losses on a paripassu basis for years for certain acquired loans secured by mortgages on real property or shares in cooperative property constituting a primary residence the indemnification assets which represent the fair value of the csla and sfsla are reflected in the total assets acquired as part of the consideration paid jpmorgan chase issued a fiveyear billion secured note to the fdic the purchase money note the purchase money note bears interest at a fixed rate of and is secured by certain of the acquired loans the purchase money note is prepayable upon notice to the fdic the firm had placed a billion deposit with first republic bank on march as part of billion of deposits provided by a consortium of large us banks the firms billion deposit was effectively settled as part of the acquisition and the associated allowance for credit losses was released upon closing the firm subsequently repaid the remaining billion of deposits to the consortium of banks including accrued interest through the payment date on may the computation of the purchase price the

first republic bank and the billion payable to the fdic as part of the purchase price consideration are considered noncash transactions the following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the firm for the following assets acquired and liabilities assumed core deposit and customer relationship intangibles sharedloss agreements and the related indemnification assets purchase money note and fhlb advances refer to jpmorgan chases form 10k for a discussion of the firms accounting policies and valuation methodologies for securities loans deposits and lendingrelated commitments core deposit and customer relationship intangibles core deposit and certain wealth management customer relationship intangibles were acquired as part of the first republic transaction the core deposit intangible of billion was valued by discounting estimated aftertax cost savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits using the favorable source of funds method the aftertax cost savings were estimated based on the difference between the cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost of next best alternative funding sources available to market participants the customer relationship intangibles of million were valued by discounting estimated aftertax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the multiperiod excess earnings method both intangible asset valuations utilized assumptions that the firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair values such as growth and attrition rates projected fee income as well as related costs to service the relationships and discount rates the core deposit and customer relationship intangibles will be amortized over a projected period of future cash flows of approximately years as of june the carrying values of the core deposit and customer relationship intangibles were billion and million respectively reflecting accumulated amortization of approximately million and million respectively indemnification assets sharedloss agreements the indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries from the fdic associated with the sharedloss assets over the respective shared loss recovery periods the indemnification assets were recorded at fair value in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets on the acquisition date the fair values of the indemnification assets were estimated based on the timing of the forecasted losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses the subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the indemnification assets will be based on changes in amount and timing of forecasted losses in the allowance for credit losses associated with the shared loss assets and will be recorded in other income under certain circumstances the firm may be required to make a payment to the fdic upon termination of the sharedloss agreements based on the level of actual losses and recoveries on the sharedloss assets the estimated potential future payment is reflected as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price consideration purchase money note and fhlb advances the purchase money note is recorded in longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheets the fair value of the purchase money note was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated market discount rates the fhlb advances assumed in the acquisition are recorded in shortterm borrowings and in longterm debt the fair value of the fhlb advances was based on a discounted cash flow methodology and

interestonly or minimum payment the minimum payment on an option arm loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period this introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate the fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin once the introductory period ends the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index the minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan option arm loans are subject to payment recast which converts the loan to a variablerate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and
