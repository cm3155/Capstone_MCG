cash collateral held by the firm in addition the firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that the firm believes is legally enforceable and may be used as security when the fair value of the clients exposure is in the firms favor for the purpose of this disclosure the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the lcr rule in managements view the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the lcr rule but that the firm believes is legally enforceable the collateral amounts for each counterparty are limited to the net derivative receivables for the counterparty the firm also holds additional collateral primarily cash g7 government securities other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities and corporate debt and equity securities delivered by clients at

var is calculated assuming a oneday holding period and an expected tailloss methodology which approximates a confidence level for risk management purposes the firm believes this methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the lobs and corporate and along with other market risk measures provides the appropriate information needed to

rates could result in negative interest rates the us has never experienced an interest rate environment where the federal reserve has a negative interest rate policy in a negative interest rate environment the modeling assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities require additional management judgment and therefore the actual outcomes may differ from these assumptions the firms nonus

risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the firms traditional banking activities which include extension of loans and credit facilities taking deposits and issuing debt as well as from the investment securities portfolio refer to the table on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a summary by lob and corporate identifying positions included in earningsatrisk one way the firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earningsatrisk earningsatrisk estimates the firms interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario it is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees the baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits pricing assumptions the firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars and other currencies nonus dollar currencies these simulations primarily include retained loans deposits deposits with banks investment securities long term debt and any related interest rate hedges and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management var and other sensitivitybased measures as described on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k earningsatrisk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline over the following months utilizing multiple assumptions these scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both shortterm and longterm rates by an equal amount a steeper yield curve involving holding shortterm rates constant and increasing longterm rates and a flatter yield curve involving increasing shortterm rates and holding longterm rates constant these scenarios consider many different factors including the impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates forecasted balance sheet as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior but do not include assumptions about actions that could be taken by the firm or its clients and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate changes mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates the time since origination and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience the pricing sensitivity of deposits

ongoing impact of covid19 the firm continues to leverage use of remote access and video conferencing solutions provided by third parties to facilitate remote work as a result the firm has deployed additional precautionary measures to mitigate cybersecurity risks payment fraud risk the risk of payment fraud remains at a heightened level across the industry particularly during the covid19 pandemic due to the use of contingent forms of payment authentication methods and the perpetuation of scams involving the pandemic including an increase in the level of fraud attempts against

health emergencies the safety of the firms employees and customers is of the highest priority the firmwide resiliency program is intended to enable the firm to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets ie staff technology and facilities in the event of a business interruption the program includes governance awareness training and testing of recovery strategies as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify assess and manage business interruption and public safety risks the strength and proficiency of the firmwide resiliency program has played an integral role in maintaining the firms business operations during and after various events estimations and model risk management estimations and model risk a subcategory of operational risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs the firm uses models and other analytical and judgment based estimations across various businesses and functions the estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk assessing regulatory capital requirements conducting stress testing and making business decisions while models are inherently imprecise the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment this is particularly true when the current and forecasted environment is significantly different from the historical macroeconomic environments upon which the models were trained as the firm has experienced during the covid19 pandemic this uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform adjustments to model outputs than in typical periods refer to critical accounting estimates used by the firm on pages and note of this form 10q and estimations and model risk management section on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a summary of modelbased valuations and other valuation techniques critical accounting estimates used by the firm jpmorgan chases accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results the firms most complex accounting estimates require managements judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities the firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods including any judgments made as part of such methods are wellcontrolled independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period the methods used and judgments made reflect among other factors the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies which may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner the firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate the following is a brief description of the firms critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments allowance for credit losses the firms allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the firms financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses comprises the allowance for loan losses which covers the firms retained loan portfolios scored and riskrated the allowance for lendingrelated commitments and the allowance for credit losses on investment securities which covers the firms htm and afs securities the allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts incorporation of historical loss experience assessment of risk characteristics assignment of risk ratings valuation of collateral and the determination of remaining expected life refer to note and note of jpmorgan chases form 10k for further information on these judgments as well as the firms policies and methodologies used to determine the firms allowance for credit losses and refer to allowance for credit losses on pages and note of this form 10q for further information one of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the firms allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eightquarter forecast period within the firms methodology the eightquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of mevs that are relevant for exposures across the firm with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables the specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography key mevs for the consumer portfolio include us unemployment hpi and us real gdp key mevs for the wholesale portfolio include us real gdp us unemployment us equity prices corporate credit spreads oil prices commercial real estate prices and hpi changes in the firms assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next the covid19 pandemic resulted in a weak labor market and weak overall economic conditions that affected borrowers across the firms consumer and wholesale lending portfolios the us economy has continued to improve with the benefits of vaccination and as more businesses have reopened thereby reducing certain pandemicrelated macroeconomic uncertainties however uncertainties remain including the pace of vaccination progress the impact of additional waves and new virus strains the health of underlying labor markets and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors further judgment is still required to estimate the speed and trajectory of the economic recovery it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast the firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments the central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of mevs but differed in the levels paths and peakstroughs of those variables over the eightquarter forecast period for example compared to the firms central scenario described on page and in note the firms relative adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated us unemployment rate through averaging approximately higher over the eightquarter forecast with a peak difference of approximately in the fourth quarter of lower us real gdp with a slower recovery remaining nearly lower at the end of the eightquarter forecast with a peak difference of approximately in the fourth quarter of and lower national hpi with a peak difference of nearly and forecasted trough both in the third quarter of estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended june fair value jpmorgan chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value the majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis including derivatives structured note products and certain securities financing agreements certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis including certain mortgage home equity and other loans where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral assets measured at fair value the following table includes the firms assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy refer to note for further information june in billions except ratios total assets at fair value total level assets federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements securities borrowed trading assets tradingdebt and equity instruments derivative receivablesa total trading assets afs securities loans msrs other total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis total assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis total assets measured at fair value total firm assets level assets at fair value as a percentage of total firm assetsa level assets at fair value as a percentage of total firm assets at fair valuea a for purposes of the table above the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments however the billion of derivative receivables classified as level does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset the level balances would be reduced if netting were applied including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral this analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses for a number of reasons including the firm continues to place meaningful weighting on its adverse scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit losses as of june and accordingly the existing allowance already reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario the impacts of changes in many mevs are both interrelated and nonlinear so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables the covid19 pandemic has stressed many mevs used in the firms allowance estimate which has created challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimations significant changes in the expected severity and duration of the economic downturn caused by the covid19 pandemic effects of government support and customer assistance and speed and trajectory of the subsequent recovery could significantly affect the firms estimate of expected credit losses irrespective of the estimated sensitivities described below to demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of june the firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario without considering the additional weight the firm has placed on its adverse scenarios or any other offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the firms allowance for credit losses for these lending exposures the comparison between these two scenarios reflects the following differences an increase of approximately million for residential real estate loans and lendingrelated commitments an increase of approximately billion for credit card loans an increase of approximately billion for wholesale loans and lendingrelated commitments this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on thencurrent circumstances and conditions recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain particularly in light of the recent economic conditions

interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes litigation reserves refer to note of this form 10q and note of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves valuation estimating fair value requires the application of judgment the type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the firm for instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level of the valuation hierarchy judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels and in arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use second the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess all relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including for example transaction details yield curves interest rates prepayment speed default rates volatilities correlations prices such as commodity equity or debt prices valuations of comparable instruments foreign exchange rates and credit curves refer to note for a further discussion of the valuation of level instruments including unobservable inputs used for instruments classified in levels and management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality the firms creditworthiness market funding rates liquidity considerations unobservable parameters and for portfolios that meet specified criteria the size of the net open risk position the judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole in periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates particularly for positions that are less liquid refer to note for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the firm imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position furthermore while the firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios the firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value the use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date refer to note for a
