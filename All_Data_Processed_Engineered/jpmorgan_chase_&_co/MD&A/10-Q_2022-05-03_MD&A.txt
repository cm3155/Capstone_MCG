should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced extended cancelled or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring as a result the firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lendingrelated commitments is representative of the firms expected future credit exposure or funding requirements refer to note for further information on wholesale lendingrelated commitments receivables from customers receivables from customers reflect heldforinvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in cib ccb and awm that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients brokerage accounts eg cash on deposit and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities because of this collateralization no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables to manage its credit risk the firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral or to reduce positions when appropriate these receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the firms consolidated balance sheets derivative contracts derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices the firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its marketmaking activities including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables the firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure the nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the firm is exposed for otc derivatives the firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty for exchangetraded derivatives etd such as futures and options and cleared overthecounter otccleared derivatives the firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house ccp where possible the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements the percentage of the firms overthecounter derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements excluding foreign exchange spot trades which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily was approximately at both march and december refer to note for additional information on the firms use of collateral agreements refer to note for a further discussion of derivative contracts counterparties and settlement types the fair value of derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were billion and billion at march and december respectively the increase was largely commodities predominantly oil and gas as a result of market movements derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the firm in addition the firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the clients exposure is in the firms favor for these purposes the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the lcr rule in managements view the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the lcr rule the benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty the firm also holds additional collateral primarily cash g7 government securities other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities and corporate debt and equity securities delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions as well as collateral related to contracts that have a nondaily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the clients derivative contracts move

losses as of march was billion an increase from billion at december consisting of million in wholesale across the lobs and million in consumer driven by the residential real estate portfolio the change in the allowance largely reflects an increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios from the more balanced weighting placed on the adverse and upside scenarios at december due to the potential effects associated with higher inflation changes in monetary policy as well as geopolitical risks including the war in ukraine the increase in the allowance also included clientspecific

daily gains and losses that are utilized for var backtesting purposes the gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the firms reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue such as those associated with the execution of new transactions ie intraday clientdriven trading and intraday risk management activities fees commissions certain valuation adjustments and net interest income these excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day the definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under basel iii capital rules a backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily risk management var for the prior day under the firms risk management var methodology assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation the firm would expect to incur var backtesting exceptions on average five times every trading days the number of var backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the months of historical data used in the var calculation for the months ended march the firm

rate exposure on the firms reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the firms significant market risks interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the firms traditional banking activities which include extension of loans and credit facilities taking deposits issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio refer to the table on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a summary by lob and corporate identifying positions included in earningsatrisk one way the firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earningsatrisk earningsatrisk estimates the firms interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario it is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees the baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of deposits pricing assumptions the firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars and other currencies nonus dollar currencies these simulations primarily include retained loans deposits deposits with banks investment securities longterm debt and any related interest rate hedges and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management var and other sensitivitybased measures as described on page of jpmorgan chases form 10k earningsatrisk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline over the following months utilizing multiple assumptions these scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both shortterm and longterm rates by an equal amount a steeper yield curve involving holding shortterm rates constant and increasing longterm rates and a flatter yield curve involving increasing shortterm rates and holding longterm rates constant or holding shortterm rates constant and decreasing longterm rates these scenarios consider many different factors including the impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates forecasted balance sheet as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the firm or its clients and customers in response to any such instantaneous rate changes mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates the time since origination and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience deposit forecasts used in the baseline and scenarios include certain assumptions relating to the reversal of quantitative easing the pricing sensitivity of deposits known as deposit betas represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates the deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid due to repricing lags and other factors the firms earningsatrisk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the firms balance sheet changes in market conditions improvements in the firms

the country risk management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the firms exposures are diversified given the firms strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country refer to pages of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a further discussion of the firms country risk management sources and measurement the firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits investing and marketmaking activities whether cross border or locally funded country exposure includes activity with both government and privatesector entities in a country under the firms internal country risk management approach attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the country where the largest proportion of the assets of the counterparty issuer obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived which may be different than the domicile ie legal residence or country of incorporation individual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the firms risk to an immediate default with zero recovery of the counterparties issuers obligors or guarantors attributed to that country activities which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not included in the country exposure measure for example providing clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables assumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure particularly in the case of certain nonlinear or index products or where the nature of the counterparty issuer obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an individual country the use of different measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of reported country exposure risk reporting the following table presents the firms top exposures by country excluding the us as of march and their comparative exposures as of

view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows the increase in exposure to germany and the

response to the war in ukraine numerous sanctions have been imposed on russia and russiaassociated entities and individuals by various governments around the world including the authorities in the us the uk and the eu these sanctions are complex and evolving at a rapid pace in response to the war the firm faces increased operational risk associated with interpreting and maintaining these complex compliance programs to manage this increased risk the firm has implemented additional controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of noncompliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to sanctions as well as to block or restrict payments as required by the applicable regulations business and technology resiliency risk disruptions can occur due to forces beyond the firms control such as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics severe weather power or telecommunications loss failure of a third party to provide expected services cyberattacks and terrorism the firmwide business resiliency program is designed to enable the firm to prepare for adapt to withstand and recover from business disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets ie staff technology facilities and third parties the program includes governance awareness training planning and testing of recovery strategies as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify assess and manage business interruption and public safety risks critical accounting estimates used by the firm jpmorgan chases accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results the firms most complex accounting estimates require managements judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities the firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods including any judgments made as part of such methods are wellcontrolled independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period the methods used and judgments made reflect among other factors the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies which may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner the firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate the following is a brief description of the firms critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments allowance for credit losses the firms allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the firms financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain offbalance sheet lendingrelated commitments the allowance for credit losses comprises the allowance for loan losses which covers the firms retained loan portfolios scored and riskrated the allowance for lendingrelated commitments and the allowance for credit losses on investment securities the allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts incorporation of historical loss experience assessment of risk characteristics assignment of risk ratings valuation of collateral and the determination of remaining expected life refer to note and note of jpmorgan chases form 10k for further information on these judgments as well as the firms policies and methodologies used to determine the firms allowance for credit losses and refer to allowance for credit losses on pages and note of this form 10q for further information one of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the firms allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eightquarter forecast period within the firms methodology the eightquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of mevs that are relevant for exposures across the firm with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables the specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography key mevs for the consumer portfolio include us unemployment hpi and us real gdp key mevs for the wholesale portfolio include us real gdp us unemployment us equity prices corporate credit spreads oil prices commercial real estate prices and hpi changes in the firms assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast the firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments the central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of mevs but differed in the levels paths and peakstroughs of those variables over the eightquarter forecast period for example compared to the firms central scenario shown on page and in note the firms relative adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated us unemployment rate averaging approximately higher over the eightquarter forecast with a peak difference of approximately in the fourth quarter of lower us real gdp with a slower recovery remaining nearly lower at the end of the eightquarter forecast with a peak difference of approximately in the fourth quarter of and lower national hpi with a peak difference of in the fourth quarter of this analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses for a number of reasons including the firm increased the weight placed on the adverse scenarios in estimating the allowance for credit losses as of march and accordingly the existing allowance reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario the impacts of changes in many mevs are both interrelated and nonlinear so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses to demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of march the firm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the firms allowance for credit losses the comparison between these two scenarios for the lending exposures below reflect the following differences an increase of approximately million for residential real estate loans and lendingrelated commitments an increase of approximately billion for credit card loans an increase of approximately billion for wholesale loans and lendingrelated commitments this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on thencurrent circumstances and conditions recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain particularly in light of the recent economic conditions the firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended march fair value

10q and note of jpmorgan chases form 10k for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves valuation estimating fair value requires the application of judgment the type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the firm for instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level of the fair value hierarchy judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels and in arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use second the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including for example transaction details yield curves interest rates prepayment speed default rates volatilities correlations prices such as commodity equity or debt prices valuations of comparable instruments foreign exchange rates and credit curves refer to note for a further discussion of the valuation of level instruments including unobservable inputs used for instruments classified in levels and management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality the firms creditworthiness market funding rates liquidity considerations unobservable parameters and for portfolios that meet specified criteria the size of the net open risk position the judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole in periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates particularly for positions that are less liquid refer to note for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the firm imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position furthermore while the firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the firms businesses and portfolios the firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value the use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date refer to note for a detailed discussion of the firms valuation process and hierarchy and its determination of fair
