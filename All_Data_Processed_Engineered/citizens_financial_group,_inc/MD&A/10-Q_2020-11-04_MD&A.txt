citizens regularly enters into security repurchase agreements with unrelated counterparties which involve the transfer of a security from one party to another and a subsequent transfer of substantially the same security back to the original party the companys repurchase agreements are typically shortterm in nature and are accounted for as secured borrowed funds on the companys

guarantee by a third party in the guarantors were fnma and fhlmc in the guarantors were fnma fhlmc and gnma the debt securities received from the guarantors are classified as afs impairment upon purchase of htm investment securities and at each subsequent measurement date citizens is required to evaluate the securities for risk of loss over their life and if necessary establish an associated reserve recognition of a reserve for expected credit losses is not required if the amount the company expects to realize is zero commonly referred to as zero expected credit losses the company evaluated its existing htm portfolio and concluded that all of the securities met the zero expected credit loss criteria and therefore no cecl reserve was booked for htm securities as of the balance sheet date citizens reviews its afs debt securities for impairment at the individual security level on a quarterly basis or more frequently if a potential loss triggering event occurs the initial indicator of impairment for debt securities classified as afs is a decline in fair value below its amortized cost basis for any security that has declined in fair value below the amortized cost basis the company recognizes an impairment loss in current period earnings if management has the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis estimating the recovery of the amortized cost basis of a debt security is based upon an assessment of the cash flows expected to be collected if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected discounted at the securitys original effective yield is less than the amortized cost basis impairment equal to the shortfall in cash flows has occurred citizens evaluates whether any portion of the impairment is attributable to creditrelated factors or various other market factors affecting the fair value of the security eg interest rates spread levels liquidity in the sector etc and the public credit rating of the security if creditrelated factors exist creditrelated impairment has occurred regardless of the companys intent to hold the security until it recovers the creditrelated portion of impairment is recognized in current period earnings as provision expense through the establishment of an allowance for afs securities to the extent the allowance does not reduce the value of the afs security below its current fair value the remaining noncredit related portion of impairment is recognized in oci improvement in credit losses in subsequent periods results in a reversal of the allowance for afs securities and a corresponding decrease to provision expense to the extent the allowance does not become negative accrued interest receivable on afs debt securities is excluded from the balances used to calculate the allowance for afs securities all accrued and uncollected interest is immediately reversed against interest income when it is deemed uncollectible the company has evaluated any afs securities in an unrealized loss position at september and concluded that all unrealized losses are due to noncredit related factors as such the company does not have an allowance for afs securities as of september citizens financial group inc the following table presents afs mortgagebacked debt securities with fair values below

recovery of their amortized cost bases citizens has determined that credit losses are not expected to be incurred on the remaining agency and nonagency mbs identified with unrealized losses as of

citizens financial group inc note allowance for credit losses nonaccruing loans and leases and concentrations of credit risk allowance for credit losses managements estimate of expected credit losses in the companys loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the alll and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments collectively the acl see note in the companys form 10k for a detailed discussion of the acl reserve methodology and estimation techniques as of december upon adoption of cecl effective january the companys acl reserve methodology changed to estimate expected credit losses over the contractual life of loans and leases the acl is maintained at a level the company believes to be appropriate to absorb expected lifetime credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and lease portfolios and on the unfunded lending commitments the determination of the acl is based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable considering a number of relevant underlying factors including key assumptions and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information key assumptions used in the acl measurement process include the use of a twoyear reasonable and supportable economic forecast period followed by a oneyear period during which the expected credit losses revert to longterm historical macroeconomic inputs the evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information is performed through assessments of groups of assets that share similar risk characteristics and certain individual loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collective group loans are grouped generally by product type eg commercial commercial real estate residential mortgage etc and significant loan portfolios are assessed for credit losses using econometric models the quantitative evaluation of the adequacy of the acl utilizes a single economic forecast as its foundation and is primarily based on econometric models that use known or estimated data as of the balance sheet date and forecasted data over the reasonable and supportable period known and estimated data include current pd lgd and ead for commercial loans and leases timing and amount of expected draws for unfunded lending commitments fico ltv term and time on books for retail loans mix and level of loan balances delinquency levels assigned risk ratings previous loss experience current business conditions amounts and timing of expected future cash flows and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition business and management performance forwardlooking economic assumptions include real gross domestic product unemployment rate interest rate curve and changes in collateral values this data is aggregated to estimate expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loans and leases adjusted for expected prepayments in highly volatile economic environments historical information such as commercial customer financial statements or consumer credit ratings may not be as important to estimating future expected losses as forecasted inputs to the models the acl may also be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that the company considers to reflect current judgment of various events and risks that are not measured in the statistical procedures including uncertainty related to the economic forecasts used in the modeled credit loss estimates loan growth back testing results credit underwriting policy exceptions regulatory and audit findings and peer comparisons the qualitative allowance is further informed by multiple alternative scenarios to support the periodend acl balance the measurement process results in specific or pooled allowances for loans leases and unfunded lending commitments and qualitative allowances that are judgmentally determined and applied across the portfolio there are certain loan portfolios that may not need an econometric model to enable the company to calculate managements best estimate of the expected credit losses less data intensive nonmodeled approaches to estimating losses are considered more efficient and practical for portfolios that have lower levels of outstanding balances eg runoff or closed portfolios new products or products that are not significant to the companys overall credit risk exposure loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics are individually assessed for expected credit losses nonaccruing commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of million or greater and all commercial and commercial real estate tdrs regardless of size are assessed on an individual loan level basis generally the measurement of acl on individual loans and leases is the present value of its future cash flows or the fair value of its underlying collateral if the loan or lease is collateral dependent loans that are deemed citizens financial group inc to be collateral dependent are written down to the fair value less costs to sell if sale of the collateral is expected as of the evaluation date and are reassessed each subsequent period to determine if a change to the acl is required subsequent evaluations may result in an increase or decrease to the acl based on a corresponding change in the fair value of the collateral during the period any subsequent decrease to the acl because of an increase to the collateraldependent loans fair value is limited to the total amount previously written off for that loan for retail tdrs that are not collateral dependent the acl is developed using the present value of expected future cash flows compared to the amortized cost basis in the loans expected redefault factors are considered in this analysis retail tdrs that are deemed collateral dependent are written down to fair market value less cost to sell expected recoveries are considered in managements estimate of the acl and may result in a negative adjustment ie reduction to the acl balance a loan is collateral dependent if repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty as of the evaluation date generally repayment would be expected to be provided substantially by the sale or continued operation of the underlying collateral if cash flows to repay the loan from all other available sources including guarantors are expected to be no more than nominal if repayment is dependent only on the operation of the collateral the fair value of the collateral would not be adjusted for estimated costs to sell if a loan is considered collateral dependent the acl is calculated as the difference between the fair

and is assigned to the companys reporting units at the acquisition date a reporting unit is a business operating segment or a component of a business operating segment citizens has identified and assigned goodwill to two reporting units consumer banking and commercial banking based upon reviews of the structure of the companys executive team and supporting functions resource allocations and financial reporting processes once goodwill has been assigned to reporting units it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition and all of the activities within a reporting unit whether acquired or organically grown are available to support the value of the goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests citizens reviews goodwill for impairment annually as of october st and in interim periods when events or changes indicate the carrying value of one or more reporting units may not be recoverable the company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than the carrying value if it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying value then no further testing is necessary otherwise citizens must perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill citizens may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment the quantitative assessment used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting units fair value to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value inclusive of goodwill applicable goodwill is deemed to be not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit inclusive of goodwill exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the excess the impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted citizens financial group inc under the quantitative impairment assessment the fair values of the companys reporting units are determined using a combination of income and marketbased approaches citizens relies on the income approach discounted cash flow method for determining fair value market and transaction approaches are used as benchmarks only to corroborate the value determined by the discounted cash flow method citizens relies on several assumptions when estimating the fair value of its reporting units using the discounted cash flow method these assumptions include the discount rate as well as projected loan loss income tax and capital retention rates in the first quarter of us economic conditions deteriorated significantly with the spread of the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns in response to the crises and the ongoing impacts to the banking industry and markets in which citizens operates the company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in the third quarter when calculating the fair value of the companys reporting units under the income approach short and mediumterm forecasts incorporated current economic conditions and ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic including a federal funds target near zero and nearterm elevated acl offset by significant monetary and fiscal stimulus longterm cash flow projections reflected normalized rate and credit environments as well as a longterm rate of return for each reporting unit at the conclusion of the quantitative assessment it was determined that the estimated fair value of the commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately and that of the consumer banking reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value the change in the carrying value of goodwill for the nine months ended september is presented below in millions consumer banking commercial banking total balance at december business acquisitions balance at september accumulated impairment losses related to the consumer banking reporting unit totaled billion at

these vies and accounts for these investments in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets citizens applies the proportional amortization method to account for its lihtc investments under the proportional amortization method the company applies a practical expedient and amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits received in the current period as compared

assets citizens will continue to act as primary servicer for the sold educational loans and will receive a servicing fee a thirdparty special servicer will be responsible for servicing for all loans that become significantly delinquent as discussed below at the time of the sale and at each subsequent reporting period citizens is required to evaluate its involvement with the vie to determine if it holds a variable interest in the vie and if so if the company is the primary beneficiary of the vie if citizens is both a variable interest holder and the primary beneficiary of the vie it would be required to consolidate the vie as of september the company concluded that both their investment in assetbacked securities as well as the primary servicing fee are considered variable interests in the vie as there is a possibility even if remote that would result in either the companys interest in the assetbacked securities or the primary servicing fee absorbing some of the losses of the vie after concluding that the company has one or more variable interests in the vie the company must determine if the company is the primary beneficiary of the vie gaap defines the primary beneficiary as the entity that has both an economic exposure to the vie as well as the power to direct the activities that are determined to be most significant to the economic performance of the vie in order to make this determination the company needed to first establish which activities are the most significant to the economic performance of the vie based on a review of the historical performance of the types of education loans sold to the vie as well as consideration of which activities performed by the owner or servicer of the loans contribute most significantly to the ultimate performance of the loans the company concluded that the determination of the assets to be purchased by the vie and the servicing activities that are performed for significantly delinquent loans are the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the loans and thus the performance of the vie holding these assets as a result the company concluded that the entity that controls the determination of the assets to be purchased by the vie and the servicing activities on significantly delinquent loans controls the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie as part of the sale process the equity holder in the vie had the ability to remove loans from the proposed sale pool demonstrating control over the determination of the assets to be purchased in addition as a holder of assetbacked securities and the primary servicer of the loans citizens does not have the power to direct servicing of significantly delinquent loans these rights are reserved for the thirdparty special servicer of the loans who is controlled through a contractual relationship with the equity investor in the vie as the activities which most significantly affect the performance of the vie are controlled by the equity holder in the vie and not by citizens the company has concluded that citizens is therefore not the primary beneficiary accordingly citizens does not consolidate

benefits from a return generated by government incentives plus other tax attributes that are associated with tax ownership eg tax depreciation as a tax equity investor citizens does not have the power
