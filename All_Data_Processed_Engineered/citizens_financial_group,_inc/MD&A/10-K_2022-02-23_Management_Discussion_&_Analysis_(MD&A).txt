table start citizens financial group inc table end results of operations compared with net interest income net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interestearning assets and the effective cost of our interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local

due february liquidity risk we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entitys ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entitys ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor damaged market confidence factors affecting liquidity given the composition of assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity risk at cbna would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the gnma fnma and the fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress similarly given the structure of its balance sheet the funding liquidity risk of cbna would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest an additional variable affecting our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such

requirements sections in item liquidity risk management and governance liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset liability committee in managing liquidity risk the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies our funding and liquidity units primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and costefficient funding sources we seek to accomplish this goal by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities as of december organically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding

results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below see note in item for further discussion of our significant accounting policies allowance for credit losses the acl decreased from billion at december to billion at december reflecting a reserve release of million reflecting improvements in our macroeconomic outlook and continued strength in the home price index and used automobile values to determine the acl as of december we utilized an economic forecast that generally reflects real gdp growth of approximately over and projects the unemployment rate to be in the range of to throughout this forecast reflects an overall improved macroeconomic outlook as compared to december which reflected real gdp growth of approximately over and unemployment in the range of approximately to throughout while the us economy has continued to improve with the benefits of vaccination and herd resiliency muting in part the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic uncertainty remains we continue to utilize our qualitative allowance framework to reassess and adjust acl reserve levels macroeconomic forecast risk driven by uncertainty around and volatility of key macroeconomic variables is one of the primary factors influencing our qualitative reserve as the economic recovery has continued we have assessed risks to the recovery including potential for continuing impacts from covid19 variants challenges in the global supply chain inflationary trends potential impacts from ending monetary and fiscal stimulus programs and potential for longerterm changes in workforce and consumer behaviors we continued to apply management judgment to adjust the modeled reserves in the commercial industry sectors most impacted by the covid19 pandemic including cre office our determination of the acl is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable period to illustrate the sensitivity we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which assumes that challenges in acceptance of vaccines and efficacy of vaccines against new strains cause covid19related infections to abate later than in our base case scenario with concerns rising about resistant strains consumer spending is slower to rebound with businesses reopening more slowly and vacation spending muted this pessimistic scenario reflects real gdp growth of approximately and unemployment in the range of to over excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately our modeled periodend acl or an increase of approximately million this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall periodend acl which includes qualitative adjustments because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the acl this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the acl or even what the acl would be under these economic circumstances the sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates the hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other table start citizens financial group inc table end qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the acl and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates to provide additional context regarding sensitivity to more pessimistic scenarios our acl balance of billion represents of the billion of ninequarter losses projected in the federal reserve run of the december supervisory severely adverse scenario which forecasted more protracted unemployment and gdp declines compared with our acl calculation our acl calculation also included the impacts of government stimulus comparatively our acl represents of the billion of projected losses in the company run results of the supervisory severely adverse scenario losses projected under the company supervisory severely adverse scenario are lower than the federal reserve results due to methodology and modeling differences as an example the federal reserves models did not recognize contractual loss sharing arrangements in the merchant loan portfolio both the company and federal reserve results include incremental losses associated with loan originations assumed postdecember in contrast our december acl balance considers only existing loans and lines of credit as of the reporting date while the economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic continues significant future uncertainty still exists including the impacts of covid19 variants and challenges from vaccine acceptance rates and efficacy against newer strains on consumer sentiment and spending behavior it remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our acl because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction and such changes may have differing impacts by product types the variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the recovery including potential for continuing impacts from covid19 variants challenges in the global supply chain and recent inflationary trends as well as potential impacts from ending monetary and fiscal stimulus programs changes in one or multiple of the key variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses we continue to monitor the impact of covid19 and related fiscal and monetary policy measures on the economy and the resulting potentially material effects on the acl for additional information regarding the acl see note and note in item fair value we measure the fair value of assets and liabilities using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is also used on a recurring and nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for financial statement disclosure purposes examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include impairment for certain loans leases and goodwill examples of recurring uses of fair value for financial statement disclosure purposes include disclosure of the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities accounted for on an amortized cost basis such as htm securities for certain assets or liabilities the application of management judgment in the determination of the fair value is more significant due to the lack of observable market data msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices msrs are classified as level since the valuation methodology utilizes significant unobservable inputs the fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow model which uses assumptions including weightedaverage life prepayment assumptions and weightedaverage option adjusted spread it is important to note that changes in our assumptions may not be independent of each other changes in one assumption may result in changes to another eg changes in interest rates which are inversely correlated to changes in prepayment rates may result in changes to discount rates the underlying assumptions and estimated values are corroborated by values received from independent third parties based on their review of the servicing portfolio and comparisons to market transactions for

risk management activities first line of defense the business lines including their associated support functions are the first line of defense and are accountable for identifying assessing managing and controlling the risks associated with the products and services they provide the business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and assess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility complying with relevant risk policies testing and certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular basis establishing and documenting operating procedures and establishing and owning a governance structure for identifying and managing risk second line of defense the second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for developing and ensuring implementation of risk and control frameworks and related policies this centralized risk function is appropriately independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our business lines on the effective management of their risks including credit market operational regulatory reputational interest rate liquidity and strategic risks third line of defense our internal audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance with a view of the effectiveness of our internal controls governance practices and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for the size complexity and risk profile of the organization internal audit has complete and unrestricted access to any and all of our records physical properties and personnel internal audit issues a report following each internal review and provides an audit opinion to the boards audit committee on a quarterly basis credit review reports to the chief audit executive and provides the legalentity boards senior management and other stakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed credit risk appetite and credit policies and processes in line with its procedures and regulatory expectations the credit review function undertakes a program of portfolio testing assessing and reporting through four risk pillars of asset quality rating and data integrity risk management and credit risk appetite risk appetite risk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool we define our risk appetite as the maximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and capital adequacy obligations our principal nonmarket risks include credit operational regulatory reputational liquidity and strategic risks we are also subject to certain market risks which include potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices market risk in our business arises from trading activities that

risk appetite is reviewed and approved annually by the board risk committee credit risk overview credit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer counterparty or issuer failing to perform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation while the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management and trading activities given the financial impact of credit risk on our earnings and balance sheet the assessment approval and management of credit risk represents a major part of our overall riskmanagement responsibility objective the independent credit risk function is responsible for reviewing and approving credit risk appetite across all lines of business and credit products approving larger and higher risk credit transactions monitoring portfolio performance identifying problem credit exposures and ensuring remedial management organizational structure management and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the business line and the second line of defense the second line of defense the

reporting alll analytics current expected credit loss and credit policy and administration each team under these leaders is composed of highly experienced credit professionals governance the primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit policies these policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk appetite material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite or highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the credit policy committee executive risk committee and the board risk committee for approval as appropriate key management processes we employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively identify measure monitor and mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit life cycle origination account managementportfolio management and loss mitigation and recovery consumer on the consumer banking side of credit risk our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the life cycle of the loan starting at origination credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant when approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line credit scores are used in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability length of term collateral value collateral type and lien subordination to ensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams lending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter the amount of delegated authority depends on the experience of the individual we periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually reauthorize their delegated authority only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are authorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies it is not uncommon to make exceptions to established policies table start citizens financial group inc table end when compensating factors are present there are exception limits which when reached trigger a comprehensive analysis once an account is established credit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals to allow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk our approach to managing credit risk is highly analytical and where appropriate is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency commercial on the commercial banking side of credit risk risk management begins with defined credit products and policies and is separated into ci loans leases and cre within ci loans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products eg assetbased lending leasing franchise finance health care technology and midcorporate a specialty vertical is a standalone team of industry or product specialists substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined industry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists cre also operates as a specialty vertical commercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and with few exceptions are subject to a formal annual review requirement the underwriting process includes the establishment and approval of credit grades that confirm the pd and lgd all material transactions then require the approval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of delegated authority the approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit relationship as well as the pd the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit approver function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution all authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent credit risk function and is closely monitored and regularly updated the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower assessment of the borrowers management capabilities cash flows from operations industry sector trends type and sufficiency of collateral type of exposure transaction structure and the general economic outlook while these are the primary factors considered there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process in addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and annual review our credit review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality of the portfolio and new originations this group conducts portfolio reviews on a riskbased cycle to evaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the effectiveness of credit risk management the maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers concentration risk is managed through limits on industry asset class and loan quality factors we focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets although we do engage in lending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and aligned with strategic initiatives substantially all loans categorized as classified are managed by a specialized group of credit professionals market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices andor other relevant market rates or prices modest market risk arises from trading activities that serve customer needs including hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk as described below more material market risk arises from our nontrading banking activities such as loan origination and depositgathering we have established enterprisewide policies and methodologies to identify measure monitor and report market risk we actively manage market risk for both nontrading and trading activities nontrading risk we are exposed to market risk as a result of nontrading banking activities this market risk is substantially composed of interest rate risk as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk we also have market risk related to capital markets loan originations as well as the valuation of our msrs table start citizens financial group inc table end interest rate risk interest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets liabilities and equity we refer to this nontrading risk embedded in the balance sheet as structural interest rate risk or interest rate risk in the banking book a major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets relative to liabilities and equity there are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity andor repricing of assets and liabilities for example the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly with changes in libor while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a longer period there may also be differences in the drivers of rate changes loans may be tied to a specific index rate such as libor or prime while deposits may be only loosely correlated with libor and dependent upon competitive demand due to these basis differences net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads between certain indices or repricing rates another important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options for example most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer deposits can also be withdrawn without penalty the exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing differences discussed above a primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floatingrate loans relative to core deposit funding this source of asset sensitivity is more biased toward the short end of the yield curve the secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or reinvestment risk on fixedrate loans as well as prepayment risk on mortgagerelated loans and securities funded by nonrate sensitive deposits and equity the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by our board these limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons to ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within our risk appetite we must measure the exposure and hedge it as necessary the treasury asset and liability management team is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on our structural interest rate risk position these exposures are reported on a monthly basis to the asset liability committee and at board meetings we measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both shortterm and longterm exposures the primary method we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in which we model net interest income from assets liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios over a threeyear horizon exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted net interest income across the scenarios key assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments the most material of these behavioral assumptions relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate ie noncontractual maturities as well as the pace of mortgage prepayments assessments are periodically made by running sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of key assumptions the results of these analyses are reported to the asset liability committee as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance we use simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including a most likely implied forward scenario as well as a variety of deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios these scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level of interest rates immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in short or longterm rates predominate generally projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is compared to net interest income in a base case where market forward rates are realized the table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios our policies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit while an instantaneous and table start citizens financial group inc table end severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve table start table sensitivity of net interest income estimated change in net interest income over months december basis points instantaneous change in interest rates gradual change in interest rates table end we continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy and changing market conditions asset sensitivity against a basis point gradual increase in rates was at december compared with at december current levels of asset sensitivity continue to provide meaningful upside benefit to net interest income as we enter a period of expected higher shortterm policy rates from the federal reserve changes in interest rates can also affect the risk positions which impacts the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on assets that allow for early payoff without a penalty the risk position is managed within our risk limits and long term view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments interest rate swaps and mix of funding we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk economic value of equity eve as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities the change in value is expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital we use interest rate swap contracts to manage the interest rate exposure to variability in the interest cash flows on our floatingrate assets and floatingrate wholesale funding and to hedge

our lending products securities derivatives and other financial transactions utilize the libor benchmark rate requiring us to develop plans for its discontinuance in late we formed a libor transition program the program designed to guide the organization through the planned discontinuation of libor the program with direction and oversight from our chief financial officer is responsible for developing maintaining and executing against a coordinated strategy to ensure a timely and orderly transition from libor the program is structured to address various initiatives including program governance transition management communications exposure management new alternative reference rate product delivery risk management contract remediation operations and technology readiness accounting and reporting as well as tax and regulation impacts on a quarterly basis we tracked and reviewed the risks associated with the libor transition with a focus on the identification of mitigation actions the arrc recommended that banks be systemically and operationally capable of supporting transactions in alternative reference rates such as sofr by the end of september guided by this milestone we are systemically and operationally prepared to support alternative reference rate transactions on march the fca formally announced the future cessation or loss of representation of the libor benchmark settings currently published by the intercontinental exchange ice benchmark administration further the fca stated that the 1week and 2month us dollar libor rates will cease as of december and all other us dollar libor tenors will cease as of june with the frb occ and fdic collectively the agencies supporting this announcement the program adjusted libor transition activities and timelines accordingly the agencies continue to urge market participants to stop entering into new us dollar libor contracts as soon as practicable but no later than the end of we moved new originations to alternative reference rates over the course of in anticipation of this deadline however our plans for legacy contract remediation now extend through mid2023 given the fca announcement more broadly program governance remains robust and progress has been made in the aboveoutlined initiatives as management continues to closely monitor industry and regulatory developments pertaining to the transition upon commencement of the program we conducted an impact assessment to identify all areas that were likely to be impacted by the libor transition the impact assessment identified where liborrelated products systems models policies and procedures existed we used the assessment results to develop a robust transition roadmap and an implementation plan which continues to evolve based on market and regulatory developments key libor transition efforts over the course of include but are not limited to the following upgraded standard form provisions and issued implementation guidance to require use of reference rate fallback language in any new and existing libor contracts in connection with contract amendments made in the ordinary course of business launched new product issuances with alternative reference rates completed operational readiness of systems models and applications to handle all potential alternative reference rates remediated legacy contracts that reference nonus dollar libor in preparation for the december cessation of libor quotations for nonus dollar currencies analyzed existing fallback language in legacy contracts to assess robustness and devise a strategy for those requiring remediation table start citizens financial group inc table end continued to develop and enhance internet and intranet sites for the libor transition and participated in industry and arrc working groups to ascertain market developments and assess the impact to us and our customers capital markets a key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit facilities to partially finance merger and acquisition transactions for our clients we have a rigorous risk management process around these activities including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk our potential loss and sublimits for specific asset classes further the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior level individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction adjudicated in the loan underwriting approval committee mortgage servicing rights we have market risk associated with the value of residential msrs which are impacted by various types of inherent risks including duration basis convexity volatility and yield curve as part of our overall risk management strategy relative to the fair market value of the msrs we enter into various freestanding derivatives such as interest rate swaps interest rate swaptions interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgagebacked securities to economically hedge the changes in fair value as of december and the fair value of our msrs was billion and million respectively and the total notional amount of related derivative contracts was billion and billion respectively gains and losses on msrs and the related derivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees in the consolidated statements of operations as with our traded market riskbased activities earnings at risk excludes the impact of msrs msrs are captured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at risk that is consistent with the definition used by banking regulators trading risk we are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and foreign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities exposure is created as a result of changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility foreign exchange rates equity prices and credit spreads on a select range of interest rates foreign exchange commodities equity securities corporate bonds and secondary loan instrumentsthese securities underwriting and trading activities are conducted through cbna ccmi and jmp client facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives financially settled commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or exchange to manage our market risk exposure in addition to the aforementioned activities we operate trading desks covering secondary loans corporate bonds and equity securities all with the objective to meet secondary liquidity needs of our issuing clients transactions and investor clients we do not engage in any trading activities with the intent to benefit from shortterm price differences we record these rate and commodity derivatives and foreign exchange contracts as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets trading assets and liabilities are carried at fair value with income earned related to these activities included in net interest income changes in fair value of trading assets and liabilities are reflected in other income a component of noninterest income on the consolidated statements of operations market risk governance the market risk limit setting process is established inline with the formal enterprise risk appetite process and policy this appetite reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for creating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to assume dealing authorities represent the key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout the enterprise a dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business andor trading desk is permitted to operate which is reviewed at least annually dealing authorities are structured to accommodate client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile primary responsibility for keeping within established tolerances resides with the business key risk indicators including var open foreign table start citizens financial group inc table end currency positions and single name risk are monitored on a daily basis and reported against tolerances consistent with our risk appetite and business strategy to relevant business line management and risk counterparts market risk measurement we use var as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal market conditions our var framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same risk management var is based on a one day holding period to a confidence level whereas regulatory var is based on a tenday holding period to the same confidence level in addition to var nonstatistical measurements for measuring risk are employed such as sensitivity analysis market value and stress testing our market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models capture correlation effects across all our covered positions and allow for aggregation of market risk across products risk types business lines and legal entities we measure monitor and report market risk for both management and regulatory capital purposes var overview the market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation the var measure estimates the extent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements general var such as changes in the level of interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices it is calculated on the basis that current positions remain broadly unaltered over the course of a given holding period it is assumed that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions if required within this holding period vars benefit is that it captures the historic correlations of a portfolio based on the composition of our covered positions we also use a standardized addon approach for the loan trading and high yield bond desks specific risk capital which estimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements the general var approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past trading days the internal var measure used as the basis of the main var trading limits is a confidence level with a one day holding period meaning that a loss greater than the var is expected to occur on average on only one day in trading days ie of the time theoretically there should be a loss event greater than var two to three times per year the regulatory measure of var is done at a confidence level with a tenday holding period the historical market data applied to calculate the var is updated on a twobusiness day lag refer to market risk regulatory capital below for details of our tenday var metrics for the quarters ended december and respectively including high low average and period end var for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks as well as total var table start citizens financial group inc table end market risk regulatory capital the us banking regulators market risk rule covers the calculation of market risk capital for the purposes of the market risk rule all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and do qualify as covered positions the internal management

de minimis exposure addon total market risk regulatory capital market riskweighted assets table end stressed var svar is an extension of var as it uses a longer historical lookback horizon that is fixed from january this is done not only to identify headline risks from more volatile periods but also to provide a counterbalance to var which may be low during periods of low volatility the holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days in addition to risk management purposes svar is also a component of market risk regulatory capital we calculate svar daily under its own dynamic window regime in a dynamic window regime values of the tenday var are calculated over all possible 260day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set refer to market risk regulatory capital above for details of svar metrics including high low average and period end svar for the combined portfolio sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor such as a one basis point change in rates or credit spread we conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates basis spreads foreign exchange exposures option prices and credit spreads whereas var is based on previous moves in market risk factors over recent periods it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves sensitivity analysis complements var as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an effective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations stress testing conducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables that simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios for historical stress tests profit and loss results are simulated for selected time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns while hypothetical stress tests aim to consider concentration risk illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our trading activities that may not be fully captured by our other risk measurement methodologies hypothetical scenarios also assume that market moves happen simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes place to mitigate losses as market events unfold we generate stress tests of our trading positions on a daily basis for example we currently include a stress test that simulates a lehmantype crisis scenario by taking the worst 20trading day peak to trough moves for the various risk factors that go into var from that period and assumes they occurred simultaneously table start citizens financial group inc table end var model review and validation market risk measurement models used are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance analysis by the model owners the independent review and validation focuses on the model methodology market data and performance independent review of market risk measurement models is the responsibility of citizens model risk management and validation team aspects covered include challenging the assumptions used the quantitative techniques employed and the theoretical justification underpinning them and an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time where possible the quantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions will be estimated eg through developing alternative models results of such reviews are shared with our us banking regulators the market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market price levels and price action regime behavior the market risk management and validation team will conduct internal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to a market data mapping var backtesting backtesting is one form of validation of the var model and is run daily the market risk rule requires a comparison of our internal var measure to the actual net trading revenue excluding fees commissions reserves intraday trading and net interest income for each day over the preceding year the most recent business days any observed loss in excess of the var number is taken as an exception the level of exceptions determines the multiplication factor used to derive the var and svarbased capital requirement for regulatory reporting purposes when applicable we perform subportfolio backtesting as required under the market risk rule using models approved by our banking regulators for interest rate credit spread and foreign exchange positions the
