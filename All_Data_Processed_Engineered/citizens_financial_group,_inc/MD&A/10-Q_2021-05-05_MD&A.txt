see introduction nongaap financial measures and nongaap financial measures and reconciliations citizens financial group inc results of operations net interest income net interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interestearning assets and the effective cost of our interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates for further discussion refer to market risk

liquidity is defined as our ability to meet our cashflow and collateral obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost an institution must maintain operating liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cashflow requirements as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected stress scenario funding requirements as noted earlier reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stressscenario funding requirements we identify and manage contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb unencumbered highquality and liquid securities and unused fhlb borrowing capacity separately we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb and unencumbered highquality securities we consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our health and strength we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity including at the parent company and cbna level parent company liquidity our parent companys primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from cbna as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt and externally issued preferred stock as well as senior and subordinated debt uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends interest and expenses the needs of subsidiaries including cbna for additional equity and as required its need for debt financing and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary to the extent the parent company has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest during the three months ended march and the parent company declared dividends on common stock of million and million respectively and declared dividends on preferred stock of million and million respectively our parent companys cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet various needs and totaled billion as of march and december the parent companys citizens financial group inc doubleleverage ratio the combined equity investment in parent company subsidiaries divided by parent company equity is a measure of reliance on equity cash flows from subsidiaries to fund parent company obligations at march the parent companys doubleleverage ratio was cbna liquidity in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna is managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities and wholesale borrowings as needed and as described under liquidity risk management and governance the primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits payment of interest on deposits funding of loans and related commitments and funding of securities purchases to the extent that cbna has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest for further information on cbnas outstanding debt see note as cbnas primary business involves taking deposits and making loans a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and for loans liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary liquidity risk we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entitys ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entitys ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor damaged market confidence factors affecting liquidity given the composition of assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity risk at cbna would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the gnma fnma and the fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress similarly given the structure of its balance sheet the funding liquidity risk of cbna would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest citizens financial group inc an additional variable affecting our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moodys standard and poors and fitch table credit ratings march moodys standard and poors fitch citizens financial group inc longterm issuer nr bbb bbb shortterm issuer nr a2 f1

not rated changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding as a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile cbna continues to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding at march our wholesale funding consisted primarily of term debt issued by the parent company and cbna existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices the frb the occ and the fdic regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process in addition we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements some of which are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators for further discussion see regulation and supervision tailoring of prudential requirements and liquidity requirements in our form 10k liquidity risk management and governance liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset liability committee in managing liquidity risk the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies our funding and liquidity units primary goal is to deliver and otherwise maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements and contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and costefficient funding sources we seek to accomplish this goal by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities as of march core deposits continued to be our primary source of funding and our consolidated period end loantodeposits ratio which excludes lhfs was our cash position which is defined as cash balance held at the frb totaled billion our total available liquidity comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity was

discount window capacity defined as available total borrowing capacity from the frb based on identified collateral is secured by nonmortgage commercial and retail loans and totaled billion use of this borrowing capacity would be considered only during exigent circumstances and for a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the three months ended march and see the consolidated statements of cash flows the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics including specific risk thresholds limits these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows current liquidity sources and capacities including cash at the frbs free and liquid securities and available and secured fhlb borrowing capacity liquidity stress sources including idiosyncratic systemic and combined stresses in addition to evolving regulatory requirements and current and prospective exposures including secured and unsecured wholesale funding and spot and cumulative cashflow gaps across a variety of horizons further certain of these metrics are monitored individually for cbna and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis including cash position unencumbered securities asset liquidity and available fhlb borrowing capacity in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions specific metrics

critical accounting estimates our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements which are included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below for additional information regarding fair value measurements see critical accounting estimates in our form 10k allowance for credit losses we reserve for expected credit losses on our loan and lease portfolio through the alll and for expected credit losses in our unfunded lending commitments through other liabilities collectively the alll and allowance for expected credit losses in unfunded lending commitments are referred to as the acl changes in the acl are reflected in net income through provision for credit losses changes in the credit risk profile of our loans and leases result in changes in provision expense with a resulting change net of chargeoffs and recoveries in the acl balance citizens financial group inc the acl is often the most critical of all the accounting estimates for banking institutions like us the acl is maintained at a level we believe to be appropriate to absorb expected lifetime credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and lease portfolios and on the unfunded lending commitments our determination of the acl is based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable considering a number of relevant underlying factors including key assumptions and evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information key assumptions used in our acl measurement process include the use of a twoyear reasonable and supportable economic forecast period followed by a oneyear period during which the expected credit losses revert to longterm historical macroeconomic inputs the evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information is performed through assessments of groups of assets that share similar risk characteristics and certain individual loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collective group loans are grouped generally by product type eg commercial and industrial commercial real estate residential mortgage etc and significant loan portfolios are assessed for credit losses using econometric models the evaluation process is inherently imprecise and subjective as it requires significant management judgment based on underlying factors that are susceptible to change sometimes materially and rapidly the quantitative evaluation of the adequacy of the acl utilizes a single economic forecast as its foundation and is primarily based on econometric models that use known or estimated data as of the balance sheet date and forecasted data over the reasonable and supportable period known and estimated data include current probability of default loss given default and exposure at default for commercial timing and amount of expected draws for unfunded lending commitments fico ltv term and time on books for retail loans mix and level of loan balances delinquency levels assigned risk ratings previous loss experience current business conditions amounts and timing of expected future cash flows and factors particular to a specific commercial credit such as competition business and management performance forwardlooking economic assumptions include real gross domestic product unemployment rate interest rate curve and changes in collateral values this data is aggregated to estimate expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loans and leases adjusted for expected prepayments in highly volatile economic environments historical information such as commercial customer financial statements or consumer credit ratings may not be as important to estimating future expected losses as forecasted inputs to the models the acl may also be affected materially by a variety of qualitative factors that we consider to reflect our current judgment of various events and risks that are not measured in our statistical procedures including uncertainty related to the economic forecasts used in the modeled credit loss estimates loan growth back testing results credit underwriting policy exceptions regulatory and audit findings and peer comparisons the qualitative allowance is further informed for certain industry sectors and certain loan classes by alternative scenarios to support the periodend acl balance we recognize that this approach may not be suitable in certain economic environments and differing analysis may be requested at managements discretion due in part to its subjectivity the qualitative evaluation may be materially impacted during periods of economic uncertainty and late breaking events could lead to revision of reserves to reflect managements best estimate of expected credit losses the measurement process results in specific or pooled allowances for loans leases and unfunded lending commitments and qualitative allowances that are judgmentally determined and applied across the portfolio there are certain loan portfolios that may not need an econometric model to enable us to calculate managements best estimate of the expected credit losses less data intensive nonmodeled approaches to estimating losses are considered more efficient and practical for portfolios that have lower levels of outstanding balances eg runoff or closed portfolios and new products or products that are not significant to our overall credit risk exposure the acl decreased from billion at december to billion at march reflecting a reserve release of million to determine the acl as of march we utilized an economic forecast that generally reflects real gdp growth of approximately over returning to fourth quarter real gdp levels by the last quarter of the forecast also projects the unemployment rate to be in the range of to throughout overall this forecast reflects an improved macroeconomic outlook as compared to december in addition to judgment applied at the commercial portfolio as a whole we continued to apply management citizens financial group inc judgment to adjust the modeled reserves in the commercial industry sectors most impacted by the covid19 pandemic and associated lockdowns including cre retail and hospitality and casual dining our determination of the acl is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable period to illustrate we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which assumes that challenges in widespread distribution and acceptance of vaccines cause covid19 related hospitalization and fatality rates to be higher than base case the decline in consumer spending from associated reductions in travel and an increase in state and local government restrictions cause real gdp to drop and unemployment to rise beyond our current forecast this pessimistic scenario reflects real gdp growth of approximately and unemployment in the range of to over excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately our period end acl or an increase of approximately million because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the acl this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the acl or even what the acl would be under these economic circumstances the sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates the hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the acl and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates to provide additional context regarding sensitivity to more pessimistic scenarios our acl balance of billion represents of the billion of ninequarter losses projected in the federal reserve run of the december supervisory severely adverse scenario the supervisory severely adverse scenario which forecasted more protracted unemployment and gdp declines compared with our acl calculation our acl calculation also included the impacts of government stimulus comparatively our acl represents of the billion of projected losses in the company run results of the supervisory severely adverse scenario losses projected under the company run supervisory severely adverse scenario are lower than the federal reserve run results due to methodology and modeling differences as an example the federal reserves models did not recognize contractual loss sharing arrangements in the merchant loan portfolio in addition both the company run and federal reserve run results include incremental losses associated with loan originations assumed postjune in contrast our march acl balance considers only existing loans and lines of credit as of the reporting date while the recovery path is clearer than it was at the end of the fourth quarter significant future uncertainty still exists including progress in the rollout acceptance and effectiveness of covid19related vaccines it remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our acl because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction and such changes may have differing impacts by product types further the variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by existing or future monetary and fiscal stimulus programs and forbearance and other customer accommodation efforts nevertheless changes in one or multiple of the key variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses we continue to monitor the impact of covid19 vaccination efforts and related policy measures on the economy and the resulting potentially material effects on the acl for additional information regarding the alll and allowance for unfunded lending commitments see note and note citizens financial group inc risk governance we are committed to maintaining a strong integrated and proactive approach to the management of all risks to which we are exposed in pursuit of our business objectives a key aspect of our boards responsibility as the main decision making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure

parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is asset sensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis we believe that any actual shift

current levels of asset sensitivity are elevated relative to our core sensitivity profile due to meaningful increases in cash and deposit balances as a result of monetary and fiscal stimulus programs in light of the yield curve steepening experienced in first quarter asset sensitivity has been reduced as we continue to balance near term net interest income considerations with the potential future
