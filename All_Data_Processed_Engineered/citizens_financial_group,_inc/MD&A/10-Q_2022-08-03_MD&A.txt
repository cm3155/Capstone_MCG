meet our cashflow and collateral obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost an institution must maintain operating liquidity to meet its expected daily and forecasted cashflow requirements as well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected stress scenario funding requirements reflecting the importance of meeting all unexpected and stressscenario funding requirements we identify and manage contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb unencumbered highquality liquid securities and unused fhlb borrowing capacity separately we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of contingent liquidity consisting of cash balances at the frb and unencumbered highquality liquid securities we consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our health and strength we manage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity including at the parent company and cbna level citizens financial group inc parent company liquidity our parent companys primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from cbna as a result of investing in bank equity and subordinated debt as well as externally issued preferred stock senior debt and subordinated debt uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company including periodic share repurchases and payments of dividends interest and expenses the needs of subsidiaries including cbna for additional equity and as required its need for debt financing and the support for extraordinary funding requirements when necessary

fund parent company obligations the parent companys doubleleverage ratio was and as of june and december respectively cbna liquidity as cbnas primary business involves taking deposits and making loans a key role of liquidity management is to ensure that customers have timely access to funds from deposits and for loans liquidity management also involves maintaining sufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding requirements when necessary in the ordinary course of business the liquidity of cbna is managed by matching sources and uses of cash the primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and commercial customers payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities and wholesale borrowings as needed and as described under liquidity risk management and governance the primary uses of bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits payment of interest on deposits funding of loans and related commitments and funding of securities purchases to the extent that cbna has relied on wholesale borrowings uses also include payments of related principal and interest for further information on cbnas outstanding debt see note during the six months ended june cbna completed the following transactions issued million of fixedtofloating rate senior notes and redeemed billion and million of senior notes due february and may respectively liquidity risk we define liquidity risk as the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its payment obligations in a timely manner at a reasonable cost liquidity risk can arise due to contingent liquidity risk andor funding liquidity risk contingent liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions may reduce an entitys ability to liquidate pledge andor finance certain assets and thereby substantially reduce the liquidity value of such assets drivers of contingent liquidity risk include general market disruptions as well as specific issues regarding the credit quality andor valuation of a security or loan issuer or borrower andor asset class funding liquidity risk is the risk that market conditions andor entityspecific events may reduce an entitys ability to raise funds from depositors andor wholesale market counterparties drivers of funding citizens financial group inc liquidity risk may be idiosyncratic or systemic reflecting impediments to operations andor damaged market confidence factors affecting liquidity given the composition of assets and borrowing sources contingent liquidity risk at cbna would be materially affected by events such as deterioration of financing markets for highquality securities eg mortgagebacked securities and other instruments issued by the gnma fnma and the fhlmc by any inability of the fhlbs to provide collateralized advances andor by a refusal of the frb to act as a lender of last resort in systemic stress similarly given the structure of its balance sheet the funding liquidity risk of cbna would be materially affected by an adverse idiosyncratic event eg a major loss causing a perceived or actual deterioration in its financial condition an adverse systemic event eg default or bankruptcy of a significant capital markets participant or a combination of both consequently and despite ongoing exposure to a variety of idiosyncratic and systemic events we view our contingent liquidity risk and our funding liquidity risk to be relatively modest an additional variable affecting our access to unsecured wholesale market funds and to large denomination ie uninsured customer deposits is the credit ratings assigned by such agencies as moodys standard and poors and fitch table credit ratings june moodys standard and poors fitch citizens financial group

longterm deposits a1 nr a shortterm deposits p1 nr f1 nr not rated changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our wholesale funding as a result and in order to maintain a conservative funding profile cbna continues to minimize reliance on unsecured wholesale funding at june our wholesale funding consisted primarily of term debt issued by the parent company and cbna and collateralized advances from the fhlb existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity conditions and liquidity management practices the frb occ and fdic regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the overall supervisory process in addition we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements some of which are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators for further discussion see regulation and supervision tailoring of prudential requirements and liquidity requirements in our form 10k liquidity risk management and governance liquidity risk is measured and managed by the funding and liquidity unit within our treasury unit in accordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our board and the asset liability committee in managing liquidity risk the funding and liquidity unit delivers regular and comprehensive reporting including current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators explanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and as appropriate recommended remedial strategies citizens financial group inc our funding and liquidity units primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating liquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements contingent liquidity to support unexpected funding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic systemic and combination stress events and regulatory liquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and costefficient funding sources we seek to accomplish these goals by funding loans with stable deposits by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding particularly shortterm unsecured funding and by maintaining ample available liquidity including a contingent liquidity buffer of unencumbered highquality loans and securities as of june organically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding resulting in a consolidated period end loantodeposits ratio excluding lhfs of our total available liquidity comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity was approximately billion contingent liquidity was billion consisting of unencumbered highquality liquid securities of billion unused fhlb capacity of billion and our cash balances at the frb of billion and available discount window capacity defined as available total borrowing capacity from the frb based on identified collateral is secured primarily by nonmortgage commercial and retail loans and totaled billion use of this borrowing capacity would be considered only during exigent circumstances for a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the six months ended june and see the consolidated statements of cash flows the funding and liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning indicators and metrics including specific risk thresholds limits these monitoring tools are broadly classified as follows current liquidity sources and capacities including cash balances at the frb free and liquid securities and secured fhlb borrowing capacity liquidity stress sources including idiosyncratic systemic and combined stresses in addition to evolving regulatory requirements and current and prospective exposures including secured and unsecured wholesale funding and spot and cumulative cashflow gaps across a variety of horizons further certain of these metrics are monitored individually for cbna and for our consolidated enterprise on a daily basis including cash position unencumbered securities asset liquidity and available fhlb borrowing capacity in order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions specific metrics are also forecasted over a oneyear horizon offbalance sheet arrangements we engage in a variety of activities that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are generally referred to as offbalance sheet arrangements for more information on these types of activities see note in item critical accounting estimates our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements estimates are made using facts and circumstances known at a point in time changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below for additional information regarding fair value measurements see critical accounting estimates in our form 10k citizens financial group inc allowance for credit losses the acl increased from billion at december to billion at june to determine the acl as of june we utilized an economic forecast that generally reflects real gdp growth on an annual average basis of and an average unemployment rate of in this forecast incorporates the risk of a mild recession beginning in the latter half of the year this compares to our december forecast which reflected real gdp growth on an annual average basis of and an average unemployment rate of in to address economic uncertainty we utilize our qualitative allowance framework to reassess and adjust acl reserve levels macroeconomic forecast risk driven by uncertainty around and volatility of key macroeconomic variables is one of the primary factors influencing our qualitative reserve our june qualitative consideration for macroeconomic risk reflects the federal reserves aggressively tightening monetary policy and the contraction of fiscal policy as pandemicrelated support winds down these conditions weighed together with the impacts of russias invasion of ukraine on key global commodity prices labor shortagerelated wage increases and continuing supplychain challenges contributing to surging inflation possibly may push the us economy into a mild recession and create volatility in key macroeconomic variables including gdp and employment our determination of the acl is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the reasonable and supportable forecast period to illustrate the sensitivity we applied a more pessimistic scenario than that described above which assumes that monetary tightening triggers real gdp contraction to three consecutive quarters resulting in a quarter percent drop in real gdp over employment contracts accordingly with an annual average unemployment rate of excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately our modeled periodend acl or an increase of approximately million this analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall periodend acl which includes qualitative adjustments because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the acl this sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the acl or even what the acl would be under these economic circumstances the sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss estimates the hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the acl and does not imply any expectation of future deterioration in our loss rates it remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our acl because such forecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur at the same time or in the same direction and such changes may have differing impacts by product types the variables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the economy including changing monetary and fiscal policies and their impact on inflationary trends as well as continuing supplychain challenges changes in one or multiple of the key variables may have a material impact to our estimation of expected credit losses for additional information regarding the acl see note of this report and critical

a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to either instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve as the following table illustrates our balance sheet is assetsensitive net interest income would benefit from an increase in interest rates while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limit while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this analysis we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and therefore have a more modest impact the table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from the market implied forward yield curve table sensitivity of net interest income estimated change in net interest income over months basis points june december instantaneous change in interest rates gradual change in interest rates we continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy changing market conditions and changes in our balance sheet asset sensitivity against a basis point gradual increase in rates was at june compared to at december the change reflects the effects of rising base net interest income including the impact of the investors acquisition and our ongoing hedge activity which locks in higher forward rates and reduces our exposure to evolving downside risks current levels of asset sensitivity will continue to provide upside benefits to net interest income as we progress through a period of expected higher shortterm policy rates from the frb changes in interest rates can also affect the risk positions which impacts the repricing sensitivity or beta of the deposit base as well as the cash flows on assets that allow for early payoff without a penalty the risk position is managed within our risk limits and longterm view of interest rates through occasional adjustments to securities investments interest rate swaps and mix of funding we use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk eve as a supplement to net interest income simulations eve complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure over a longterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in

cash equivalents is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the shortterm nature of these assets investment securities fair value estimates for afs securities were determined by thirdparty pricing vendors the thirdparty vendors use a variety of methods when pricing securities that incorporate relevant market data to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security under current market conditions these methods include the use of quoted prices for an identical or similar security and an alternative marketbased or income approach like the discounted cash flow pricing model substantially all of the investment securities acquired in connection with the investors acquisition were sold subsequent to closing to align with citizens portfolio management strategy loans held for sale loans held for sale are valued based on quoted market prices where available prices for other traded loans with similar characteristics and purchase commitments and bid information from market participants the prices are adjusted as necessary to take into consideration the specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans loans and leases fair values for loans and leases are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including type of loan and lease and related collateral fixed or variable interest rate term amortization status credit loss and prepayment expectations market interest rates and other market factors eg liquidity from the perspective of a market participant loans and leases were grouped together according to similar characteristics when applying various valuation techniques the discount rates used are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans and leases and include adjustments for liquidity the probability of default loss given default exposure at default and prepayment assumptions are the key factors driving credit losses which are embedded into the estimated cash flows premises and equipment fair value of premises is based on a market approach using thirdparty appraisals and broker opinions of value for land office and branch space core deposit intangible fair value of core deposit intangible represents the value of certain client deposit relationships estimated utilizing the favorable source of funds method appropriate consideration was given to deposit costs including servicing costs client retention and alternative funding source costs at the time of acquisition the discount rate used was derived taking into account the estimated cost of equity riskfree return rate and risk premium for the market and specific risk related to the assets cash flows the core deposit intangible is being amortized over years using an accelerated depreciation methodology deposits fair value of time deposits was estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturities for deposits with no defined maturity carrying value approximates fair value borrowed funds the fair value of borrowed funds was estimated by using a discounted cash flow methodology based
