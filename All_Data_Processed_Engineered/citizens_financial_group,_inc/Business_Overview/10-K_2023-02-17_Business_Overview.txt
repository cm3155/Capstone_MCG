industry is highly competitive our branch footprint is predominantly in the new england midatlantic and midwest regions though certain lines of business serve national markets within these markets we face competition from community banks superregional and national financial institutions credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market funds hedge funds and private equity firms some of our larger competitors may make available to their customers a broader array of products pricing and structure alternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes competition among providers of financial products and services continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of nonbanking financial institutions including fintech companies to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also intensified competition in consumer banking the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward technologydriven delivery systems permitting transactions to be conducted through telephone online and mobile channels in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbank institutions to attract funds and provide lending and other financial products and services the emergence of digitalonly banking models has increased and we expect this trend to continue given their lower cost structure these models are often on average able to offer higher rates on deposit products than retail banking institutions with a traditional branch footprint the primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates fees charged tailored value propositions to different customer segments customer service levels convenience including branch locations and hours of operation and the range of products and services offered table start citizens financial group inc table end in commercial banking there is competition for quality loan originations from traditional banking institutions particularly large regional banks as well as commercial finance companies leasing companies other nonbank lenders and institutional investors including collateralized loan obligation managers hedge funds and private equity firms some larger competitors including certain national banks that compete in our market area may offer a broader array of products and due to their asset size may sometimes be in a position to hold more exposure on their balance sheet we compete on a number of factors including providing innovative corporate finance solutions quality of customer service and execution range of products offered price and reputation human capital management we believe that our longterm success depends on our ability to attract develop and retain a highperforming workforce

internal mobility within citizens through rotational programs and our academies as well as external partnerships to support our ability to hire critical talent in areas such as technology digital cyber marketing and data employee engagement as part of our ongoing efforts to develop a high performing workforce and make citizens a great place to work and build a career we have used mckinsey

and strengthen efforts to improve our organizational effectiveness and colleague experience since our inaugural survey our overall ohi score has increased nearly points to in and is now within the first quartile of mckinseys global benchmarks the results of our ohi surveys have been instrumental in helping management prioritize areas of change that are most important to colleagues in we are transitioning to a new listening platform which will include a colleague survey tool aimed at providing additional insights as we continue to evolve our strategy and culture diversity equity and inclusion we foster a culture where all stakeholders feel respected valued and heard our dei strategy is focused on creating an environment of inclusion and belonging building a more diverse workforce

our 401k plan investment options and there were no increases to colleague premiums copays or deductibles for medical dental and vision coverage for in recognition of the impact of inflation on colleagues we implemented a return to office strategy which incorporates flexibility for colleagues as part of that strategy nonbranch roles have been assigned to various categories including fully remote hybrid or fully in the office based on the responsibilities of each role this approach has allowed us to balance colleague flexibility with inperson collaboration which we believe is key to maintaining our company values and culture fair and equitable compensation we strive to compensate our colleagues fairly based on market data experience and performance and we compare our compensation to other companies in our peer group as well as others in the financial services industry part of our commitment to building and fostering a diverse inclusive highperforming culture includes ensuring our compensation and benefits are fair and competitive for all colleagues we engage an independent thirdparty expert firm to conduct an annual pay equity analysis accounting for factors that appropriately explain differences in pay such as performance and experience additional information about this analysis including our most recent results can be found on our website and in our

through the federal reserve bank of boston under the system of functional regulation established under the bank holding company act the frb serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated

statutes including the truth in lending act the electronic funds transfer act and the real estate settlement procedures act tailoring of prudential requirements the frb and the other federal banking regulators have enacted rules that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bhcs and depository institutions to implement the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act of amendments to the doddfrank act tailoring rules under the tailoring rules we are subject to category iv standards which apply to banking organizations with at least billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for categories i through iii we discuss other elements of the tailoring rules where relevant below the liquidity requirements are described below under liquidity requirements and the stress testing requirements are described below under capital planning and stress testing requirements bank and financial holding company regulation as a fhc we may engage in a broader range of activities than a bhc that is not also a fhc these activities include securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the frb in coordination with the treasury department to be financial in nature or incidental thereto or that the frb determines unilaterally to be complementary to financial activities in addition a fhc may commence new permissible financial activities or acquire nonbank financial companies engaged in such activities in either case with afterthefact notice to the frb to maintain our fhc status a bhc and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must remain well capitalized and well managed as described below under federal deposit insurance act if a bhc fails to meet these regulatory standards the frb could place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for fhcs or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the bhc or its affiliates if the deficiencies persisted the frb could order the bhc to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for fhcs that are not permissible for bhcs or the bhc could elect to conform its nonbanking activities to those permissible for a bhc that is not also a fhc in addition the cra requires us banks to help serve the needs of their communities if a depository institution subsidiary of a bhc were to receive a cra rating of less than satisfactory the bhc would be prohibited from engaging in certain activities or acquisitions see community reinvestment act below federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other depository institutions or bhcs as noted above frb approval is generally not required for us to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the frb prior regulatory approval is required however before we may acquire or control more than of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bhc including a fhc or a bank in considering applications for approval of acquisitions the banking regulators may take several factors into account including the competitive effects of the transaction in the relevant geographic markets the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of companies involved in the transaction the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the us banking or financial system the companies compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations the convenience and needs to the communities to be served and the records of performance under the cra of the insured depository institutions involved in the transaction capital the us basel iii rules apply to us these rules establish riskbased and leverage capital requirements the riskbased requirements are based on a banking organizations riskweighted assets also known as rwa which reflect the organizations on and offbalance sheet exposures subject to risk weights the leverage requirements are based on a banking organizations average consolidated onbalance sheet assets for more detail on our regulatory capital see the capital and regulatory matters section of item table start citizens financial group inc table end we calculate rwa using the standardized approach and have made the onetime election to optout of recognizing in regulatory capital the impacts of net unrealized gains and losses included within aoci for debt securities that are available for sale or held to maturity accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges and certain defined benefit pension plan assets on january we adopted the cecl accounting standard in reaction to the covid disruption on september the federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment of the acl under cecl this rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital for a twoyear period ending december followed by a threeyear transition period ending december the threeyear transition period will phasein the reversal of the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial twoyear delay under the us basel iii rules the minimum capital ratios are cet1 capital to riskweighted assets tier capital that is cet1 capital plus additional tier capital to riskweighted assets total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets and tier capital to total average consolidated assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach known as the leverage ratio for bhcs with billion or more in assets such as us the frbs capital rules impose a dynamic institutionspecific scb on top of each of the three minimum riskweighted capital ratios listed above banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios including the scb will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income defined as the greater of four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income or the average four quarter trailing net income as a category iv firm our scb is recalibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and updated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends on august the frb announced based on the results of the ccar supervisory stress tests that our scb will remain at through september to incorporate the effects of the investors acquisition on our capital requirements the frb will require that we participate in the ccar supervisory stress test for more details see capital planning and stress testing requirements below and the capital and regulatory matters section of item we are also subject to the frbs riskbased capital requirements for market risk see the market risk section of item liquidity requirements the federal banking regulators have adopted the basel iiibased us liquidity coverage ratio rule which is a quantitative liquidity metric designed to ensure that a covered bank or bhc maintains an adequate level of unencumbered highquality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario under the tailoring rules category iv firms with less than billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding including us are not subject to any liquidity coverage ratio requirement the basel iii framework also includes a second liquidity standard the nsfr which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon in october the federal banking regulators issued a final rule to implement the nsfr for large us banking organizations under the final rule category iv firms with less than billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding including us are not subject to the nsfr requirement table start citizens financial group inc table end finally per the liquidity rules included in the frbs enhanced prudential standards adopted pursuant to section of the doddfrank act we are also required to maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for days under the tailoring rules the liquidity buffer requirements continue to apply to category iv firms such as us and we remain subject to liquidity risk management requirements however these requirements are now tailored such that we are required to calculate collateral positions monthly as opposed to weekly establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits than was previously required and monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures than were previously monitored we are also now subject to liquidity stress testing quarterly rather than monthly and are required to report liquidity data on a monthly basis capital planning and stress testing requirements under the tailoring rules category iv firms such as us are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing and are exempt from companyrun stress testing and related disclosure requirements the frb continues to supervise category iv firms on an ongoing basis including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during offcycle years we remain subject to the requirement to develop maintain and submit an annual capital plan for review and approval by our board of directors or one of its committees as well as fr y14 reporting requirements regulations relating to capital planning regulatory reporting and stress testing and capital buffer requirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rule making and potential further guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators we will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any other prudential regulatory changes including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance costs and expenses for more detail on our capital planning and stress testing requirements see the capital and regulatory matters section of item resolution planning category iv firms are no longer required to submit resolution plans to the frb and fdic however cbna is required to file periodically a separate resolution plan with the fdic that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the fdia in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institutions failure maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to the institutions creditors in june the fdic issued a statement on resolution plans for insured depository institutions that among other things established a threeyear filing cycle for banks with billion or more in total assets such as cbna and provides details regarding the content of the resolution plans that filers are required to prepare cbna submitted its most recent resolution plan to the fdic on december standards for safety and soundness the fdia requires the frb occ and fdic to prescribe operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions including cbna the agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines that set forth the safety and soundness standards used to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired if an agency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans if after being notified to submit a compliance plan an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the fdia see federal deposit insurance act below if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties table start citizens financial group inc table end federal deposit insurance act the fdia requires among other things that the federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements as described above in capital the fdia sets forth the following five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized a depository institutions capital category depends upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation the federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized with the actions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institutions capital category under existing rules an institution that is not an advanced approaches institution such as cbna is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a cet1 ratio of at least a tier capital ratio of at least a total capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least the fdias prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bhcs the frbs regulations applicable to bhcs separately define well capitalized for bhcs such as the parent company to require maintaining a tier capital ratio of at least and a total capital ratio of at least as described above under bank and financial holding company regulation a fhc that is not wellcapitalized and wellmanaged or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose fhc status as of december both the parent company and cbna were wellcapitalized the fdia prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the banks normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is wellcapitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic a bank that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates the fdia imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is wellcapitalized deposit insurance the fdia requires cbna to pay deposit insurance assessments fdic assessment rates for large institutions are calculated based on one of two scorecards one for most large institutions that have more than billion in assets such as cbna and another for highly complex institutions that have over billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over billion in assets each scorecard has a performance score and a lossseverity score that are combined to produce a total score which is translated into an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic utilizes the camels ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to assess an institutions ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic may make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard the total score is then translated to an initial base assessment rate on a nonlinear sharply increasing scale the deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period deposit insurance assessments are also affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the dif the fdia established a minimum dif reserve ratio of prior to september and thereafter as of september the reserve ratio of the dif was on october the fdic finalized a rule that will increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of the fdic as required under the fdia established a plan in september to restore the dif reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of within eight years the increased assessment is intended to improve the likelihood that the dif reserve ratio would reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline of september dividends various federal statutory provisions and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay table start citizens financial group inc table end our payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the oversight of the frb in particular the frb reviews the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bhc based on capital plans submitted as part of the ccar process and on the results of stress tests as discussed above in addition to other limitations our ability to make any capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is subject to the prior approval of the frb if we are required to resubmit our capital plan see capital and capital planning and stress testing requirements above dividends payable by cbna as a national bank subsidiary are limited to the lesser of the amount calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test under the recent earnings test a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current years net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years less any required transfers to surplus unless the national bank obtains the approval of the occ under the undivided profits test a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entitys undivided profits generally accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus federal bank regulatory agencies have issued policy statements that provide that fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of their current operating earnings support of subsidiary bank under section of the doddfrank act which codifies the frbs longstanding source of strength doctrine the parent company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength for our depository institution subsidiary the statute defines source of financial strength as the ability to provide financial assistance in the event of the financial distress at the insured depository institution the frb may require that the parent company provide such support at times even when the parent company may not have the financial resources to do so or when doing so may not serve our interests or those of our shareholders or creditors in addition any capital loans by a bhc to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bhcs bankruptcy any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment transactions with affiliates and insiders sections and of the federal reserve act and related frb rules including regulation w restrict cbna from extending credit to or engaging in certain other transactions with the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries these restrictions place limits on certain specified covered transactions between bank subsidiaries and their affiliates which must be limited to of a banks capital and surplus for any one affiliate and for all affiliates furthermore within the foregoing limitations as to amount certain covered transactions must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from to covered transactions are defined to include among other things a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the frb from the affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan
