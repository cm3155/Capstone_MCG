important to review our gaap results on page of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix and with that i will hand over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks kristin good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today was an incredible year in many respects with the feds aggressive moves to subdue inflation a west coast bank failures a surprisingly resilient economy and several significant proposals from bank regulators it was important in navigating this dynamic environment to focus first on playing strong defense while continuing to play disciplined offense and take advantage of opportunities in the market defense starts with the balance sheet and risk management and i feel really good about how we ended the year our capital position is one of the strongest among the large regionals with a cet1 ratio of cet1 adjusted for aoci of roughly and a tangible common equity ratio of our liquidity position is at an alltime best with a loantodeposit ratio of pro forma category i lcr of and a liquidity coverage of our uninsured deposits our acl ratio is at compared to pro forma dayone cecl and general office reserves are at we continue to be very disciplined in terms of lending risk appetite and are focused on deep relationships which deliver stronger relative returns we are using a noncore strategy to run off loans and free capital for better opportunities citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 on offense we have several important initiatives we are driving such as the private bank buildout the new york city metro initiative our focus on serving private capital and growing our payments business these are all tracking well in particular we are pleased to see the private bank team reached billion in deposits soon after our launch in late october our finances over the course of the year came under some pressure primarily given higher funding costs nonetheless we delivered a underlying rotce for the full year with a return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the fourth quarter we continue to see smaller sequential declines in nii than in the prior quarter as the fed last hiked in july and the pressure on funding costs has lessened we saw a modest bounce back in fees but are very encouraged by the tone of the markets in to date hopefully we start to see our big capital markets pipelines begin to deliver we took some meaningful cost actions in  to set the stage for a very modest expense growth in we only had the private bank for two quarters so if you normalize for that were actually reducing the legacy expense base by i should reinforce though that we are doing this while protecting our critical initiatives credit outlook continues to track expectations cre general office is being carefully managed losses are being absorbed in net chargeoffs its relatively predictable with few surprises so far away from that credit quality is strong in  we saw a dip in absolute criticized loans and in the ratio which is a promising sign on the capital front we did not buy in any stock in  given the charges related to the fdic special surcharge as well as associated with our cost initiatives we expect to be back in the market in  and for that to continue through turning to our outlook we expect nii to continue with modest declines through midyear and then start to tick up the exciting news on nimnii is that we project meaningful benefits from swap and noncore runoff over to which will power higher eps and returns we are poised for strong fee growth led by capital markets net chargeoffs will rise modestly but we are likely to see acl releases over the course of the year our key priorities for will be to continue to operate with a strong defenseprudent offense mindset we have many exciting things on our technology our digital data analytics and ai road map that we need to deliver on its an exciting time for citizens we feel we are well positioned for mediumterm outperformance id like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering great effort in we know we can count on you again in the new year with that let me turn it over to john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone ill start out with some commentary on we demonstrated excellent balance sheet strength while delivering solid financial performance we were resilient through a turbulent environment benefiting from near top of peer group capital levels and strong liquidity based on stable consumer insured deposits and diversified wholesale funding sources this strength allowed us to execute well against our multiyear strategic initiatives while opportunistically building out the private bank on slide you can see that we delivered underlying eps of which included a drag from noncore and an investment in the private bank full year rotce was after incorporating these items citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 before i discuss the details of the fourth quarter results here are some highlights referencing slides and on the slides you can see we generated underlying net income of million for the fourth quarter and eps of this includes for our continued investment in the startup of the private bank and a negative impact from the noncore portfolio we had a significant increase from the impacts from notable items this quarter included on slide the largest driver was the fdic special assessment followed by elevated top and severance related expenses attributable to meaningful head count reduction our underlying rotce for the quarter was our legacy core bank delivered a solid underlying rotce of currently the private bank startup investment is dilutive to results but relatively quickly this will become increasingly accretive the private bank is off to a very good start raising about billion of deposits through the end of the year of which more than are noninterestbearing while our noncore portfolio is currently a sizable drag to results it continues to run off further bolstering our overall performance going forward we ended the year with a very strong balance sheet position with cet1 at or adjusted for the aoci optout removal and an acl coverage ratio of up from in third quarter this includes a robust coverage for general office up from in the prior quarter we continued to build liquidity during the fourth quarter achieving our planned liquidity profile our pro forma category i bank lcr rose to from in the prior quarter we also reduced our periodend fhlb borrowings by billion quarteroverquarter to billion and our periodend ldrimproved linked quarter to from regarding strategic initiatives as previously mentioned the private bank is off to a great start and top continues to contribute in addition new york metro is tracking well and we are poised to capitalize on the growing private capital opportunity next ill talk through the fourth quarter results in more detail turning to slide starting with net interest income as expected nii is down linked quarter primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin partially offset by a increase in average interest earning assets as you can see from the nim walk at the bottom of the slide the combined benefit of higher asset yields and noncore runoff were more than offset by higher funding costs and swaps the net impact of which reduced nim by basis points to the level the additional basis point decline to was due to the impact of our liquidity build which was neutral to nii our cumulative interestbearing deposit beta increased a modest basis points to as the fed has paused and we see continued but slowing deposit migration we expect this moderating trend to continue until the fed eventually cuts rates overall our deposit franchise has performed well with our beta generally in the pack with peers this is a significant improvement compared to prior cycles when our beta experience was at the higher end of peers moving to slide fees were up linked quarter given improvement in capital markets and a record performance from wealth these results were partially offset by lower mortgage banking fees the improvement in capital markets reflects increased activity with the decline in long rates in november driving a nice pickup in bond underwriting equities improved with the strength in the back half of the quarter as the environment became more favorable ma advisory fees benefited from seasonality and an improvement in the environment given the better macro and rates outlook although several transactions pushed to  citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 we see capital markets momentum picking up in  as markets are positive and our deal pipelines are strong the wealth business delivered a record quarter with higher sales activity and good momentum in aum growth the decline in mortgage banking fees was driven by lower production fees as high mortgage rates continue to weigh on lock volumes the servicing operating pl improved modestly while the msr valuation net of hedging was lower on slide we did well on expenses which were down slightly linked quarter even while including the impact of the continued private bank startup investment our reported expense of billion increased million including notable items totaling million namely the industrywide fdic special assessment of million and the impact of taking cost reduction actions to adjust our expense base heading into ill discuss that in more detail in a few minutes on slide average loans are down and periodend loans are down linked quarter this was driven by noncore portfolio runoff and a decline in commercial loans which were partly offset by some modest core growth in mortgage and home equity average core loans are down largely driven by generally lower loan demand in commercial along with exits of lower returning relationships and our highly selective approach to new lending in this environment average commercial line utilization continued to decline this quarter as clients remained cautious and ma activity muted in the face of an uncertain market environment next on slides and we continue to do well on deposits periodend deposits were broadly stable linked quarter with an increase in consumer driven by the private bank offset by lower commercial the decline in commercial deposits was driven by a proactive effort to optimize the liquidity value of deposits running off approximately billion of higher cost financial institution and municipal deposits during the fourth quarter absent this bso effect deposits would have been up by about this quarter our interestbearing deposit costs are up basis points which translates to cumulative beta our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product product mix and channels with of our deposits in consumer and about insured or secure this has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in the higher rate environment with the fed holding steady we saw a continued migration of deposits to higher cost categories with non interestbearing now representing about of total deposits this is slightly below prepandemic levels and we expect the pace of migration to continue to moderate from here although this will be dependent on the path of rates and customer behavior moving on to credit on slide net chargeoffs were basis points up basis points linked quarter we were pleased to see that commercial chargeoffs were stable linked quarter and we also saw a modest decline in criticized loans as we continue to work through the general office portfolio we saw continued normalization in chargeoffs in the retail portfolio along with seasonal impacts turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide our overall coverage ratio stands at which is a basis point increase from the third quarter primarily reflecting the denominator effect of lower portfolio balances we increased the reserve for the billion general office portfolio to million which represents a coverage of up from in the third quarter as we made modest adjustments to modeled loss drivers we have already taken million in chargeoffs in this portfolio which is about of loans citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 on the bottom left side of the page you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level we feel these assumptions represent an adverse scenario that is much worse than weve seen in historical downturns so we feel the current coverage is very strong moving to slide we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio increased to and if you were to adjust for the aoci optout removal under the current regulatory proposal our cet1 ratio would be about also our tangible common equity ratio improved to at the end of the year both our cet1 and tce ratios have consistently been in the top quartile of our peers and you can see on slide in the appendix where we stand currently relative to peers in the third quarter we returned a total of million to shareholders through dividends in the fourth quarter we paused our share repurchases in the fourth quarter in light of the fdic special assessment having exceeded our target capital level for yearend we expect to resume repurchases in the first quarter nevertheless we plan to maintain strong capital and liquidity levels that fortify our balance sheet against macro uncertainties and position us to quickly transition to any new regulatory rules that may impact banks of our size on the next few pages ill update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank including our private bank and our ongoing balance sheet optimization program first on slide the buildout of the private bank is going very well and clearly gathering momentum following our formal launch in the fourth quarter our bankers have raised more than billion of attractive deposits with roughly of that from commercial clients this is a coasttocoast team with a presence in some of our key markets like new york boston and places where wed like to do more like florida and california we have plans to open a few private banking centers in these geographies and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our clarfeld wealth management business as the centerpiece of that effort moving to slide you are all well aware of our efforts in new york metro thats going really well and we are hitting our targets there and on the commercial side as i mentioned before we are starting to see momentum building in capital markets this should translate into a meaningful opportunity for us as the substantial capital backing private equity gets put to work next on slide we continue to be disciplined on expenses its important to remember that a key to citizens success since our ipo has been our continuous effort to find new efficiencies and then reinvest those benefits back into our businesses so we can serve customers better weve effectively executed our top program achieving a pretax run rate benefit of about million at the end of and weve launched top with a goal of an exit run rate of about million of pretax benefits by the end of the new top program is focused on efficiency opportunities and further automation and the use of ai to better serve our customers we are executing on opportunities to simplify our organization and save more on thirdparty spend as well last year we exited the auto business and we also exited the wholesale mortgage business in the fourth quarter we are also adjusting our expense base through further meaningful actions in the fourth quarter weve reduced our head count by about or approximately and we have also taken a hard look at our space needs and are rationalizing some of our corporate and back office facilities given all this work we are targeting to limit our underlying expense growth in to roughly to with a net decrease in legacy citizens expenses of to being offset by investments in the private bank citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 playing prudent defense is at the top of our priority list given the challenging year we saw with the turmoil that began back in march and the uncertain macro outlook so we are reworking both sides of the balance sheet through our balance sheet optimization efforts slide provides an update on our efforts to remix the loan portfolio through our noncore strategy and optimization on the commercial side with a focus on relationship based lending and attractive riskadjusted returns on the left side of the page youll see the relatively rapid rundown of the remaining billion noncore portfolio which is comprised of our shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and purchased consumer loans this portfolio is expected to decline by about billion from where we were at the end of the year to about billion at the end of and as this runs down we plan to redeploy the majority of remaining cash paydowns to a reduction in wholesale funding with the remainder used to support organic relationshipbased loan growth in the core portfolio the capital recaptured through reduction in noncore rwa will be primarily reallocated to support attractive growth in retail and commercial lending through the private bank in the broader consumer portfolio we are targeting growth in the home equity card and mortgage which offer the greatest relationship potential moving to the right side of the page we are also working on the commercial portfolio exiting lower return credit only relationships and focusing on selective ci lending with multiproduct relationship opportunities we are leading more deals in our frontbook improving spreads while also improving the overall return profile of the book in the appendix we have included more information covering the broad contours of our bso program including how we are managing our high quality deposit book remixing our wholesale funding managing our securities portfolio and positioning our capital base against the backdrop of a changing macro and regulatory environment moving to slide i will take you through our full year outlook which contemplates the early january forward curve and a fed funds rate of by the end of the year we expect nii to be down to with changes in our swaps book contributing to about half of that decline and average loans down roughly to however we expect spot loan growth of to with private bank growing over the course of the year and commercial activity picking up in the second half on the deposit side we expect spot growth of im sorry to and wellcontrolled deposit costs with a terminal beta in the low before rate cuts are anticipated to begin in may we expect our net interest margin to trough around the middle of the year and average in the to range for the full year and we expect to exit the year around weve included slide which shows the expected swaps and noncore impact through in we expect higher swap expense to be partly offset by the nii benefit from the noncore rundown youll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on slide which demonstrates how the headwind which is incorporated in our nii guide reverses to a substantial nii tailwind in and beyond as the current forward curve is realized for example there is an expected improvement in nii contribution from swaps in yearoveryear of approximately million with continued meaningful benefits in and noninterest income is expected to be up in the to range depending upon the market environment led by a nice rebound in capital markets we expect expenses to be up about to excluding the private bank citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 this would be about this would be down to we have provided a walk showing the components of our expense outlook on slide to provide more context ncos are expected to average about basis points for the year as we continue to work through the general office portfolio and expect further normalization in retail given macro trends our remixing of the balance sheet through commercial bso and the noncore strategy and expectations for modest portfolio growth we will see we will likely see acl releases over the course of the year we plan to resume share repurchases in the first quarter in the million range with more over the course of the year depending upon market conditions and loan growth taking that into account we still expect to end the year with a strong cet1 ratio of about which is at the upper end of our target range putting it all together we expect to return to sequential positive operating leverage in the second half of the year with ppnr troughing in the second quarter moving to slides and as bruce mentioned we are wellpositioned to deliver attractive returns as we look out over the medium term we have a clear path to achieve a to rotce we expect to generate solid returns from our legacy core business with a substantial nii tailwind given swap portfolio runoff we expect to deliver positive operating leverage with strong expense discipline and we are wellpositioned to grow fees meaningfully given the investments weve made in our capabilities over the past few years we also expect a meaningful contribution from the private bank as it matures and a tailwind from the runoff of the noncore portfolio as we redeploy that capital and liquidity we will continue to operate with a prudent risk appetite and focus on returning a meaningful amount of capital to shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of to over the medium term we expect our cet1 ratio to remain within our target range of to about basis points higher than our prior target range given continued uncertainty in the macro environment on slide we provide the guide for the first quarter note that the first quarter has seasonal impacts due to lower day count impact on revenue as well as taxes on compensation payouts impacting expenses to wrap up we demonstrated the resilience of the franchise and maintained strong discipline in as we work to position the bank to continue to deliver attractive returns to shareholders over the medium term we delivered solid results this quarter and we ended the year with strong capital liquidity and funding position that puts us in an excellent position to drive forward with our strategic priorities and take advantage of opportunities that may arise we are continuing to optimize the balance sheet and we are focused on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business and improve performance over the medium term with that ill hand it back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john kiely lets open it up for qa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun we are now ready for the qa portion of the call operator instructions your first question will come from the line of peter winter with da davidson your line is now open peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co can you guys provide some color on the drivers to that spot loan growth including some details about the contribution from the private bank and what youre thinking in terms of commercial line utilization john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill just start off and others can add but i mean i think those are the two drivers as you mentioned when we look out into primarily the second half of we are seeing an expectation that commercial activity will pick up loan utilization is flattening out here we expect early in the year and then so that will be part of the driver we also have had some bso activity in late and early that we expect to moderate in the second half of the year as well so youre going to see a number of nice tailwinds on the commercial side and then on the consumer side of things we are seeing opportunities with good relationship business in the mortgage space and with heloc which has been a very nice and consistent driver for us but those are the main drivers then of course broadly the private bank which has gotten off to a great start on the deposit side of things in late were going to see some of that loan opportunity pick up in so those are the big i would say components of seeing that ph spot loan growth bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah maybe brendan you could talk a little bit about what you expect for private bank lending in brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure well i would start by just a quick comment on  for the private bank obviously strong deposit print and i think demonstrating that the strength of the strategy can be very diversified and led by wealth and deposits and not necessarily requiring low interest lending to dislodge the relationships so were really excited about the print and the start by the team citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 having said that we do expect lending to pick up steam in given the interest rate environment mortgages are obviously challenged on the retail side so the lending has been more heavily led by commercial lending which has skewed in the private equity and venture space which will be appetite in the profile of that business and its been critical to start to dislodge personalprivate banking relationships from the ecosystem of private equity and venture so were off to a really good start i suspect given the forward curves that the first half of the year will continue to be led by commercial principally in private equity and venture lending over time we expect the loan book to be much more balanced and have more retail lending home equity lending mortgage lending coming in at scale as the rate environment dictates opportunities there we also expect to lean into partner loan programs to help connect the corporate side of private equity and venture with private banking and personal banking so youll start to see an asset diversification over time but the first half of the year we would expect that to still be more heavily weighted on the corporate side bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay great don anything to add on the commercial side donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think if you look back in the fourth quarter the things that dampened our loan growth a little bit were about utilization bso with a little bit of bond execution sprinkled in there so people that were carrying slightly higher balances on the commercial side a lot of them went to the bond market when rates kind of backed off in the last six weeks of the year and thats continued into this year so i think the particular area that were excited about as we get into the back end of is the private equity space i mean that group of clients has been basically dormant for almost two years theres a lots of conversations going on were hearing from most of those customers that they expect to get a lot more active and that will drive utilization on our capital call lines which is at an alltime low right now so i think thats what the real driver is bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island great peter did you have another question peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co yeah just a quick followup don its helpful but on just the fee income you talked about up to you did mention the pipeline is strong for the capital markets but just if you could give some color on the puts and takes on the fee income side bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 yeah just kind of the main drivers of that its basically a continuation of some of the trends were seeing in the fourth quarter of where capital markets is starting to pick up again pipelines are incredibly strong and i think the lead driver seems to be ma advisory thats picked up in not only due to seasonal factors but just in terms of a more constructive backdrop were also seeing as you get in out into pickup in underwriting both on the bond side and on the equity side and so and solid contributions from global markets as well but so those are some of the drivers as we see them beginning in  continuing in  with excellent pipelines and playing out over the rest of bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah you might add something on wealth brendan i dont know if you want to but we expect continued really strong growth on wealth fees brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island we do and yeah its been a year of slow and steady progression continuing to get alltime highs in the wealth management business but given the private bank investment is going to be really important year were out in the market looking to attract a lot of talent weve made a number of key hires in  both on the leadership side as well as at the advisor side and so given the ecosystem of the bankers that weve we hired in the summer connected with topend market wealth managers is critical for us were rebranding the platform to citizens private wealth management to connect the private banking and wealth side together hand in glove and so we do expect steady and significant growth out of wealth over time really connected into the private banking ecosystem so were pleased with the momentum but theres a lot more to come and we hope if we execute well on the private banking initiative bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay very good peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co and just on mortgage banking brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so john hit some highlights on  for mortgage yeah production was down a bit our underlying servicing business was up modestly and then our hedge performance was down over a big quarter in  and  i think as we look the outlook going forward we obviously announced the exit of the wholesale mortgage business if you rewind the clock back to prior to the franklin american acquisition we were underscale in mortgage and really were trying to diversify the business weve done that really successfully in hindsight it was an incredibly welltimed acquisition and we performed exceptionally well through the covid years and as we exit that period of time and look forward our msr concentration versus peers is really strong its a little bit on the high side we looked at our business model and said wholesale mortgage were one of the only ph lot lenders in there the margins were really challenged and the outlook for rates dont necessarily suggest a boomlet of refi activity in the medium term and so wholesale mortgage being a non citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 relationship business we decided that it was time to move on and were committed to correspond and were really committed to retail mortgage for relationship lending so but despite rates coming down we do expect the mortgage market to be call it a trillion originations platform in which is about a normalized mortgage market so we should see some modest uptick in originations and with rates coming back down the servicing business might see a little bit of offsetting pressure so i think we feel like were in the right zone in terms of mortgage performance where were at  within a range of normal volatility and were going to make sure that were executing on driving up returns higher and making sure were allocating balance sheet to deep relationshipbased customers whether its in the private bank or in the core retail business to continue to offer that product to our very best customers john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so wrapping all that up in we do expect volumes to improve as well as margins so thats another tailwind as we get into the into next year in terms of the production business bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you peter next question peter j winter a analyst d a davidson co thanks a lot operator next question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you guys elaborate a bit on the expense cuts that you did this quarter in terms of where theyre coming from and obviously youre leaning in on the private bank but kind of ex that how do you make sure youre not cutting too much given these initiatives and the ones that youve had in prior years bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill start off here but i think we have been very very diligent in kind of looking at staffing levels across all the different activities in the bank and seeking efficiencies theres always the playbook where if you kind of eliminate your bottom x percent of performers and redistribute some of the work that you can kind of run a little leaner and so weve gone through that exercise to make sure that we wont be caught short in any areas we carved out important areas like risk and audit and some of the control areas so they were spared kind of from taking reductions and then we also carved out the areas that are important ph to investment activities and so the rollup of all that matt comes to a relatively modest number of total staff count but i think were kind of lean and mean and in good fighting shape as we enter into citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then just separately the deposit growth that youve had from the private bank have you disclosed what that rate is i think a third of them are noninterestbearing but whats the blended rate and i guess are you using promotions whether its rate or other stuff to help grow those thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah we never really talked about that but i mean i think we should look at is that the this is accretive to the low cost profile top of the house when you look at dda and operating accounts its extremely attractive mix that weve seen come in early days so were extremely encouraged about our expectations for this to be a very sort of solid franchise deposit fully funding our loan growth that we expect on that side on the other side of the balance sheet so yeah i would say the mix is quite good and overall cost very attractive and accretive to top of house bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah theres a slide matt that lays out a pie chart of the character of the deposits but dda and then checking with interest which are very low cost roughly very little term and most of that in kind of liquid savings and money market with no promotions that are outside the norm of what were offering to the core franchise matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore your line is now open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john pancari q analyst evercore isi just a couple of questions on the credit front chargeoffs came in at around basis points in the fourth quarter you expect an average of about basis points overall in can you maybe talk to us about where you expect losses to peak and to hit that bps for the full year and what gives you confidence that they can remain there and then similarly on the reserve front i know you added to reserves in the fourth quarter but you implied you could see releases in what do you need to see to drive the releases thanks citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so ill start and john can then give some more color so i think the kind of push that weve seen higher over the course of that could continue a little bit higher into so going from basis points say to basis points is kind of twofold for the most part one is the cre general office is were watching the maturity wall ph on top of all these credits very carefully and were working them out and as i said in my opening remarks a lot of this is fairly predictable so kind of we can look ahead six months nine months we can kind of anticipate where we might have to do some restructurings and where we might take chargeoffs and so i think we have good visibility into that its a long process on the cre general office i think well have this with us all through and likely into as well but again the important thing is i think were well reserved for it and its baked into that chargeoff run rate the second area is really just continued normalization on the consumer side which has been extremely slow and gradual but theyre still slightly better than where we were precovid and so that will just gently push up as we go forward and so that would be the other driver id say the good news is that in ci were not really seeing any kind of hotspots and so we feel that we have a pretty good outlook for broad ci through on the question of the acl is this year weve been consistently building each quarter and if you get to the scenario where theres likely a soft landing or a very shallow recession weve put away enough reserves that i think we will be able to start to draw that down and so time will tell on that but you can already see that weve been starting to kind of reduce the amount of kind of reserve build from absolute provision over chargeoffs in this quarter it was flat it was million over million and so even if chargeoffs can tick up a little bit i think its likely that you could see the need for provision building from having provisions exceed chargeoffs reduce as we go through the year i dont know john if you want to add any color to that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah just a little bit i think that all makes sense and id say that the drivers of where you want to be with your reserve is we have a relatively conservative economic environment predicted over the horizon which is a mildto moderate adverse outcome so thats built in we think that were seeing stabilization in terms of the performance of the backbook in our loan book so we see visibility into the chargeoff outlook and then the build which is the other could be the other driver of acl when youre building loans that what were rotating away from and building into theres actually a net flat to improved profile in terms of the very high quality origination frontbook in the private bank and commercial that were putting on portfolio in while other stuff that may be a higher acl load is running off in the backbook so those are the things i would just add to what bruce said bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john pancari q analyst evercore isi citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 great all right thank you for that and then separately on the capital front you indicated that you expect to resume buybacks in the first quarter of maybe if you can help us possibly quantify the pace of buybacks thats fair to assume could you be back at that million quarterly rate or how should we think about that thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well at this point weve given a kind of firm estimate for the first quarter of about million so we probably with benefit of hindsight could have bought some in the fourth quarter but water under the bridge ph were so we have a little above target capital to kind of play with if you will in the first quarter and then in the first half of the year were not going to have much net loan growth noncore is going to be running down and we dont really see the flex in lending coming till the second half in the private bank and commercial as john indicated so i think the buybacks would tend to be more first halforiented but a lot can happen over the course of the year and so id kind of defer from giving a kind of quarterly run rate just to say well have a solid print in the first quarter and likely more in the second quarter and then well see how the year plays out john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i just would reiterate our capital priorities john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island our strong dividend and if we have opportunities to put capital to work serving clients and driving great really strong riskadjusted returns thats our preference and when that moderates a bit thats when you see us give it back in the form of buybacks and so were in an extremely strong position to be able to have the opportunity indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and one last addon point to your addon point is i would say im really happy to be buying my stock at these levels because we think its great value yeah john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well said john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 operator well go next to the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess maybe one question for you bruce as you think about capital deployment youve been pretty busy last year in terms the strategic actions just wondering where do you see like as you look at investment opportunities for the franchise are you done for now in terms of putting the big pieces in place or how are you thinking about new things and new investments that we could see either on an organic basis team liftouts or just outright ma bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah good question i would say the orientation right now is for backing our organic initiatives so weve mentioned the private bank and we need to continue to invest there to get that off the ground and make it a big success and weve been investing in the new york marketplace and certainly to get your brand awareness up is expensive proposition but were doing that and that is showing very good results there are certain businesses like payments that are i think going through a lot of change and that change always presents opportunities and so making sure that were investing to position ourselves to deliver for clients and continue to gain share and grow that business those are the things that kind of come top of mind that were very focused on i think in terms of acquisitions in our feebased capabilities weve made significant investments over time in commercial and so our ma size and scale is at quite a good level so we could be selective there dont see anything imminent but theres possibilities that if theres an industry vertical that makes sense maybe we could do something there and then wealth weve been looking at trying to buy some things we bought clarfeld which turned out to be a fantastic acquisition but i think the orientation the rest of this year is to really go the liftout route and to bring teams on to the platform and so were hard at work on that to try to scale up citizens private wealth so i would say the franchise is in good shape theres a lot of initiatives in place that will kind of i think have us outperform from a growth standpoint relative to our peers so i think we can sit back and be selective in terms of deploying capital inorganically ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc that is helpful and i guess just one followup in terms of for whatever reason when you look at your nii and see revenue guide in particular just maybe talk to us around expense flex if some of these things dont play out as expected should we anticipate some level of like expense offset or are you kind of pretty tight given just everything youve done on the cost side citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean theres always opportunities to look to flex your expense base down i think weve been pretty hard at it here to get to this level and id say the strategic initiatives offer you some flexibility but again if youre looking at the medium term and the longer term to try to scrape to come up with to or something of that magnitude if that puts at jeopardy your kind of trajectory on things like private bank it wouldnt appear to be a really advisable decision to take so we will always look at that you know you can trust us to do that but at this point were trying to manage for both nearterm delivery but also with an eye towards the medium term and really getting that rotce back into the kind of targeted range ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator thank you and your next question will come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thanks good morning everybody bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i think john i think youve got five rate cuts built into the guidance just maybe a broad thought on sort of where the balance sheet is geared now in other words i guess more specifically how would more or fewer cuts impact the nii outlook john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i would say that were very close to neutral one way or the other really up or down and but id say that i think whats important to the outlook is we have deposit migration continuing to moderate every quarter and it continued this quarter we expect to continue next quarter but as our outlook is ph until you get that first cut it still doesnt completely go away so we have an expectation the first cut comes in the second quarter and we get down to around i think thats still holding around where looking out the window today in the neighborhood of what the forward curve might indicate i would say that if theres a slight bias if the cuts came in a little fewer this year that would it would probably itd be okay but nevertheless that first cut is key and a general normalization and an orderly fashion over time is what we think is very good for our balance sheet again staying around neutral but maybe a slight benefit if rates come in a tiny bit higher in citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island the other aspect to that too is just weve had an inverted curve for a long time so when you think about the medium term presumably we get back to a point where there is a normal yield curve which also benefits nii john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you and then also john for you so the liquidity building efforts have introduced some noise into the margin rate even if theyve been nii neutral i guess just looking at the guidance presumably thats going to be less of a factor going forward but just maybe a thought on sort of where we are in that journey john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id say were basically weve achieved our objectives with respect to our liquidity build just the headline there and ph as i think we believe a very strong kind of position being around of the requirements for category i banks i think that matches our objectives and therefore going forward you will not see liquidity being a headwind to net interest income bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think that was something we were talking about in the back half of the year it affected us in  it affected us in  if you actually look at i think one of the dialogues on these calls way back are we going to exit the year close to underlying well we actually did do that the underlying performance on our nim was quite good it only dropped basis points which is showing up well relative to everybodys ph opinion so far but that liquidity build which is neutral to nii took us down another basis points so we end up exiting closer to than to the but that liquidity build is kind of done and so we can just focus on not having that exercise in that from the conversation and just focusing on what the underlying drivers are from here on out r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies your line is now open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys just one followup you mentioned the ppnr bottoming in the second quarter im just wondering do you expect nii to bottom coincident with that or would there be a slight timing disconnect based on how the swaps work through citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i mean i think the that is the driver basically that we are looking at nii being cut thats of our revenues so yeah the nii is going to bottom in that quarter as well bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island but in  ken then you do have other things kicking in like fee growth strong john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island loan growth yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island loan growth starting to kick in and so even though the swap is incremental forward starting swaps then i think youd have to look at the whole dynamic around what we expect to see in the business performance that would allow us to absorb that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah nim for sure indiscernible but ppnr trough is in ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc well im sorry john can you just clarify it again indiscernible john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think we were mentioning that the nim trough is but the ppnr nii trough is in ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then just looking out at the longerterm guidance you gave just talking about the mediumterm nim range it seems like that most of that can be gotten from the three buckets that you show just getting curing from the fourth quarter level and i see that you put in a end of fed funds rate so im just wondering how you expect deposit costs and just beta to traject and i know theres a lot of moving parts in there too because of the growth that youre expecting as well and mix changes but just can you maybe just start by just talking about if youre getting to the low on the way up just how that expects to act and influences that mediumterm nim range thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah its a big driver i mean i think the big puts and takes there i mean youve got the swap portfolio which is a big tailwind as weve talked about but if you go over to the deposit side of things we are looking at deposit citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 migration stabilizing around mid2024 after that first cut in may you see deposit migration stabilizing and then as cuts continue we start flipping to downbeta type of expectation versus the upbeta and we look at the early as being instructive for a lot of this where that tightening that loosening cycle or rate cutting cycle would imply a to downbeta for the first call it basis points to basis points and so thats a good i think yardstick to think through our expectation that in the early part of the cycle our downbeta will be less than the full upbeta so our full upbeta is low but nevertheless were going to get big contributions from down beta and that will grow over time getting close to where the upbeta ended up ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thank you operator and your next question will come from the line of erika najarian with ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i just had one followup question putting all your answers together john and bruce about the outlook for and the underlying dynamics of net interest income it seems to me that if we put together what you just said to ken about deposit betas in slide that despite the exit rate of your net interest margin forecasted to be in the fourth quarter based on everything that youve told us it seems like youll see a three handle in terms of that underlying nim that bruce discussed in is that a good bridge to thinking about where youre exiting in and then that mediumterm range that you gave us john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well i would say while were exiting at weve indicated thats where the fourth quarter of is going to first quarter of will be and so thats headed to the to range and so you would see us crossing that level in sometime on the way to erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc perfect yeah thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi bruce citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bruce you guys have done a great job from when you went public to where you are today in transforming this company so im curious on your mediumterm outlook for rotce on the improvement you highlight that the private bank youre targeting at to rotce can you share with us the mix of how you get there meaning what percentage of revenue do you think you need to reach from fees versus net interest income and then also what kind of pretax margin do you think youll need to get to get to that to target john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah maybe ill just start off with that gerard its john i mean i think our fees to total revenues are in the neighborhood of id say over the medium term youre going to see that migrate closer to and that would be consistent with a of the balance sheet optimization efforts where all of the capital were putting to work on the frontbook would have relationship opportunities with attractive deposit and feebased opportunities associated with it at a much greater rate than what were seeing running off in the backbook and so thats going to drive that fee percentage up closer to and when i think that the returns that we expect from a call it the rotce the rotce return that youre seeing in the medium term is consistent with a return on tangible assets thats north of so you see that getting closer to basis points as a way to think about what the returns are on the asset side bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island john youre answering at the comprehensive company on that mto page i think gerard is focused more specifically on the private bank mix but there i would say it will build over time the fee percentage as we kind of get the wealth crosssell but we should at least be at kind of where we are today in and then i think theres kind of upside from that over time and i do think the spread on the private bank assets is very significant today given the high percentage of low cost deposits in there we havent really seen the loans come on in size yet but generally capital call lines tend to be priced with a nice return and i think some of the other business lending and helocs and things ph that well maintain our price discipline and achieve a good spread there as well so i think if you look at kind of mature private banking models to have a to return on equity is realistic i dont know brendan if you want to add to that at all brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island i think its well said i wont repeat it i just would reiterate that i think the performance in  is in line with what we would have hoped for in terms of the financial profile to drive that type of return over time that obviously more loan growth on the come and a lot of it will come down to our ability to drive wealth at scale and recall our targets end of are billion in deposits billion in loans and billion in aum so if we deliver that profile and kind of the expense composition the profitability profile were seeing so far is aligned with that return citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 so were yeah were going to work hard to deliver it and hopefully our performance from  sustains in the first half gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then following up bruce maybe some thoughts on from your perspective on what we might see in this basel iii endgame obviously theres a lot of talk about scaling it back and maybe its going to be a delayed implementation because of all the changes theres a big focus as you know as we all know on the operating risk in the capital markets businesses but for the regional banks it seems like its more that numerator including the unrealized bond losses than the availableforsale portfolio but any thoughts from for citizens how you might benefit from a scale back of what was initially proposed and what will be the final proposal bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would say that for banks of our size the things that weve focused the most on have been rwa increases to certain lending activities that would potentially reduce the supply the appetite to lend in those areas because it would erode the economics so things like mortgage lending to lower income people or credit card lines attracting capital and small business lending attracting more capital i think those flaws in the proposal have been wellchronicled and even though they dont result in a meaningful rwa inflation for us i mean were stewards of the us economy and wed like to see those things adjusted thats been for kind of banks our size i think the kind of main thing at top of the list i think the operational risk kind of increases affect the bigger banks more but nonetheless they seem to have a fairly big thumb on the scale and so that likely i think will have a rethink and maybe those come down to some extent that would benefit everybody but probably the big banks more than banks like ourselves john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and maybe just to add just a quick add to that is that even if it had gone even if the basel iii endgame had gone through as initially proposed a very modest impact from a rwa standpoint on us and as it relates to aoci as we mentioned earlier were expecting that likely survives but in our case we are were at by deducting the aoci optin and thats an incredibly strong number so we sort of think about whats going on there is really behind us and really in the run rate if you will when it comes to ph that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think thats a good point that john just raised gerard is that given the strength of our capital position both pre and postaoci we can absorb any of these regulatory capital impacts but really not worry about them many of our peer banks are still kind of catching up and getting in position and having to kind of hold back on capital distribution which is really not something that were worried about given the capital strength so were more able to kind of play offense and not have to play catchup which is a good position to be in gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 absolutely in fact bruce you bring up a good point in your guidance on the medium term for the total company legacy core rotce of to you guys point out significant share repurchases should we interpret that to be a combined dividend payout and buyback ratio of of earnings then once we get the final rules and were all set to go is that a fair number ph to pull for you guys because you are wellcapitalized bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i think if you hey gerard if you go back to the time of the ipo and that number has been over and under and all over the place but if you just looked at like a 10year average almost years its about and so having enough capital to actually grow business and lend to customers you have to certainly work that into the equation but to the extent as john stated the priorities dividend is number one using capital to support organic growth principally in the loan book and then repurchasing shares i think if we get our returns into that level well be returning high levels of our earnings back to shareholders both through the dividend and through consistent share repurchase and we should be viewed as a capital return story john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i think we had a capital return performance in so its in that to range over time gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you appreciate the color bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah operator and your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley your line is now open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc just a followup to the downbeta question on deposits a few of your peers have talked about how commercial deposit rates are coming down or would come down quickly but theres likely to be some more pressure on the consumer side continuing from here theyve talked about basically consumers still moving towards higher rate accounts and given that you do have a big core consumer deposit franchise i was wondering what you are seeing right now and what your expectations are on consumer behavior as rates come down citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island brendan do you want to take that brendan coughlin a vice chairman headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure ill take that well let me start big picture and then give you a little color on  and expectations so yeah weve been talking for years that the investments weve made in transforming the consumer deposit base have truly been transformational for our performance and i think thats what were seeing here now that our consumer book is performing at a worst case peer like but certainly there are signs that we may be outperforming peers when we look at benchmark our dda balances were almost basis points better than peer average this year and or last year rather in and our net deposit growth was actually a couple of hundred basis points better than peers as well while our betas have been modestly better so if you look at that equation better deposit growth better beta really grounded with an outperformance in dda thats a good place to be and i expect regardless of what consumer behavior conditions we face in for our relative outperformance to sustain and were seeing those signs already having said that on an absolute basis what we saw in  was a slowdown in consumers deterioration in excess stimulus thats still going on a path of normalizing so were still seeing that continue but the pace of normalization has begun to slow and i think we should see that sustain in the first half of the year as rates start to tick down on the interestbearing side competitive dynamics havent really shifted yet its still fairly aggressive out there on cds and money markets but believe weve got more levers than most with citizens access as a platform where we can contain interestbearing growth on the higher cost side not sort of put contagion so to speak into the full retail bank to reprice all of our interestbearing deposits gives us a real competitive advantage and were thinking about the private bank in some ways in a similar way so weve got all the tools to compete we do expect as the rate curve follows as projected interestbearing deposits on the consumer side will start to come down as well and were starting to think about mix of balances weve got a lot of cds that potentially can roll over here in the first part of the year that well be looking to have more balance and put some of those balances into liquid savings to give us more levers to manage downbetas over the course of the year so all that is to say i feel pretty good about how we are situated were starting to see good dynamics with the consumer expect to continue and ive got a lot of confidence that well outperform peers in whatever environment comes our way bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island right manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you and then just to follow up on credit given the move lower and ph long in rates can you talk about anything youre seeing in the nonoffice cre portfolio like maybe in multifamily how do things like the debt service coverage ratios look today versus a couple of months ago and how do you expect that to trend given where the forward curve is right now citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2024 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just answer broadly that we feel good about the multifamily portfolio its characteristics its relatively small loan sizes a lot of fixed term loans good diversification geographically and so we i think felt that loss content there was going to be quite low but now obviously with rates ticking down that provides more kind of air to us in terms of the distance between the debt service coverage ratio and kind of cash flows and so we feel that its helpful but we werent worried all that much previously so anyway thats a john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i would just hasten to add that its very different than general office i mean the capital markets are still active in the context of buying and selling multifamily properties and that will just provide further tailwind to that activity bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah theres a lot of liquidity there john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah theres liquidity there where buyers and sellers are still transacting so its a very different night and day situation compared to general office and certainly rates which wont have much of an impact maybe on the general office will have a very much have a positive impact on the multifamily construct that was already okay to begin with bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah okay very good thank you manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator and there are no further questions in queue and with that ill turn it over to mr van saun for closing remarks bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay great kiely thanks again everyone for
