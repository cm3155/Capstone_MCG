morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today we are pleased with the financial performance that we delivered for the fourth quarter and for the full year as we proved adaptable and resilient given the unprecedented challenges of we continue to demonstrate the diversification and resilience of our business model as our mortgage and capital markets businesses delivered strong fourth quarter performance we remain highly focused on taking care of customers with our retail branches open and our teams working on the next round of ppp loans we feel were managing our risk well and we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives which will position us well for future growth and for franchise value ill comment briefly on a few of the financial headlines and then ill let john take you through the details our underlying  eps was our rotce was both are up from a yearago quarter and we delivered operating leverage yearonyear note that the full year operating leverage was and our ppnr growth was  credit provision was million versus million a year ago on a prececl basis as the normalization of provision to more front book origination levels helped drive our strong returns on the capital front we maintained a strong acl ratio of of exppp loans and our cet1 ratio was the strong capital and reserve position gives us a great deal of capital management flexibility in citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 we announced the million share purchase authorization today and well commence activity during the quarter we also will look to put our capital and ample liquidity position to work in finding attractive opportunities for loan growth our credit metrics all are trending favorable with ncos npas and criticized assets all lower in the quarter and a further drop in customers in forbearance we continue to allocate additional reserves to the industry segments most affected by the pandemic and lockdowns and we feel that our coverage overall is very strong with respect to our guidance for we assume a steadily improving economy and gdp growth of around relative to current consensus we see slightly higher revenue expenses and ppnr as well as much better performance on credit we see ncos at to basis points for which is relative to basis points in provision will be less than chargeoffs though how big the reserve release will be is dependent on the path of economic recovery big picture we will transition to slightly lower ppnr in given our outperformance in mortgage in but this will be more than made up for by lower credit costs as our earnings and returns bounce back towards precovid levels so all in all a very strong year of execution and delivery for all stakeholders by citizens in and we feel we are wellpositioned to do well in and continue our journey towards becoming a top performing bank id like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in we know we can count on you again in the new year with that ill turn it over to john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone lets start with a brief overview of our headlines for the quarter this was an outstanding quarter for citizens with strong fee income good expense discipline improving credit and continued steady execution against our strategic initiatives for the full year we delivered record underlying ppnr up against the challenging backdrop driven by record fee income up with record results across mortgage capital markets and wealth we achieved the ambitious top goal to deliver approximately million of run rate expense savings including approximately million of inyear benefits which supported our ongoing investments in strategic initiatives and financial performance targets to this end we improved our efficiency ratio over basis points to by delivering positive operating leverage for the year we expect further expense benefit of approximately million to million in which puts the program on track to deliver a total pretax run rate benefit of million to million by the end of strong loan growth of around reflects increased demand in education and pointofsale financing as well as ppp loans average deposits grew even faster at a result of government stimulus impact on consumers and commercial clients building liquidity citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 rotce for the full year was which includes a negative impact associated with our reserve build under cecl our acl at yearend more than doubled compared with last year but our yearend cet1 ratio of was unchanged on the year strong ppnr funded the acl build loan growth and stable dividends and finally our tangible book value per share was at quarterend up compared with a year ago next ill refer to just a couple of slides and give you some key takeaways for the fourth quarter and then outline our outlook for and the first quarter we reported underlying net income of million eps of and revenue of billion our underlying rotce was up around basis points as a result of our strong revenue performance expense discipline and improvements in credit as the economy recovers net interest income on slide was down only linkedquarter due to lower commercial loan balances and lower nim however despite the challenging rate backdrop our margin held up well with basis point decline linkedquarter driven by a basis point impact from elevated cash balances on strong deposit flows lower asset yields were offset by our improved funding mix as we grew low cost deposits with dda of and we continue to lower interestbearing deposit costs down basis points to basis points given the recent stimulus we expect continued strong deposit flows in the first quarter so elevated cash will continue to impact margin in the near term we will remain proactive in pricing down deposits and pursuing attractive loan growth opportunities in areas like pointofsale finance and education as well as an attractive commercial segment on slides and we delivered solid fees results again this quarter reflecting our ongoing efforts to invest in and diversify our revenue stream mortgage fees were down approximately this quarter due to declines in margins and volumes from exceptional levels last quarter however mortgage fees were nevertheless more than double the levels from a year ago which continues to provide good revenue diversification benefit in this low rate environment capital market fees hit record levels up linkedquarter and yearonyear driven by strong results from ma advisory and accelerating activity in loan syndications foreign exchange and interest rate products revenue was also strong up linkedquarter with higher customer activity levels tied to increased variable rate loan originations we delivered positive operating leverage of yearoveryear and improved our efficiency ratio to as expenses were wellcontrolled average core loans on slide were down linkedquarter reflecting commercial payoffs and decline in line utilization to about versus a historical average of roughly this was partially offset by growth in retail and in our education mortgage and pointofsale finance portfolios looking at yearoveryear trends core loans were up approximately due to ppp education and mortgage on slide deposit flows have been elevated especially in lowcost categories and our liquidity ratios remained strong average deposits were up linkedquarter and yearoveryear as consumers and small businesses benefited from government stimulus and clients build liquidity we are very pleased with our progress on deposit costs which declined or basis points to basis points during the quarter interestbearing deposit costs were down basis points to basis points we continue to drive a shift towards lower cost categories with average dda growth of on a linkedquarter basis and yearoveryear we expect to drive interest bearing deposit costs down to the low to midteens by the end of the year as we execute our deposit playbook to manage costs down across all channels while improving our overall funding mix citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 moving on to credit on slide our metrics were positive this quarter net chargeoffs were down basis points to basis points linkedquarter this is at the lower end of our guidance given better than expected improvement in commercial commercial chargeoffs for this quarter primarily came from segments most impacted by covid such as retail casual dining and energy nonaccrual loans decreased linkedquarter with a million decrease in commercial driven by chargeoffs return to accrual and repayment activity in addition our commercial criticized loans decreased from billion in to billion in given the performance of the portfolio and improvement in the macroeconomic outlook our reserves came down slightly but remained robust ending the quarter at excluding ppp loans compared with at the end of the third quarter this primarily reflects net chargeoffs exceeding reserving needs for new loan originations we have some detailed credit slides in the appendix for your reference but ill note that our reserve coverage for commercial excluding ppp was at the end of the year slightly up from the third quarter and within that our coverage for identified sectors of concern increased to a prudent at the end of the year from at the end of the third quarter the benefit to reserves from an improving macroeconomic backdrop offset qualitative overlays and further built reserves on these areas of concerns we maintain excellent balance sheet strength as shown on slide increasing our cet1 ratio from in to at the end of the year which is at the top of our target operating range giving positive credit trends and capital strength our board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to million of common stock beginning in first quarter before i move on to our outlook let me highlight some exciting things that are happening across the company on slide on the consumer side we are focused on national expansion the citizens access integrating some of our lending businesses to further develop our national value proposition weve recently announced the expansion of our national pointofsale offering for merchants through our citizens pay offering and we are continuing to add new merchants to our pointofsale platform as we expand into new verticals we are very excited about an announcement expected next week with a major retailer to provide payment options for their customers who want a transparent and predictable way to finance purchases through a fully digital experience in addition were making great strides in our digital transformation having launched our new mobile app on android in the fourth quarter and ios just this month weve seen our active mobile households increase yearoveryear and the majority of our deposit transactions continue to be executed outside the branch in commercial we have built out a robust corporate finance advisory model and we continue to rank near the top of our peers in customer satisfaction as we help our customers navigate this challenging environment and now for some highlevel commentary on the outlook for on slide we expect nii will be down slightly given nim expected to be down in the highsingle digits compared to which should be largely offset by loan growth loans should be up mid to highsingle digits on a spot basis with acceleration in the back half of the year with average loans of approximately overall interestearning assets should be up about to this assumes elevated cash levels come down gradually over the course of fee income is expected to be down highsingle digits off the record level reflecting lower mortgage banking fees from record levels at the same time we expect good performance in capital markets wealth and other categories that were impacted by covid19 last year noninterest expense is expected to be up just to given benefits from our top program partly offset by higher volumerelated expenses in mortgage and reinvestment in strategic initiatives we expect net chargeoffs will be in the range of to basis points of average loans with a meaningful reserve release through provision citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 now lets come to the outlook for the first quarter on slide we expect nii to be down slightly due to day count both earning assets and nim are expected to be broadly stable fee income is expected to be down highsingle digits reflecting lower mortgage banking fees as margins continue to tighten as well as seasonal impacts noninterest expense is expected to be up to reflecting seasonality in compensation we expect net chargeoffs to be in the range of to basis points of average loans we also expect another quarter with provision less than chargeoffs based on expected loan growth levels and macroeconomic trends to wrap up this was a strong quarter for citizens and a good finish to the year as we continue to navigate successfully through the covid19 crisis and demonstrate the resilience of our franchise we are well positioned to have another strong year in with that ill hand it back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island all right thank you john and operator lets open it up to some qa question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun operator instructions our first question will come from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler go ahead please r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning guys thank you for taking my question bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co lets see bruce for you or one of the other members of management team just any visibility or further color you could give onto the expectation for loan growth to accelerate later in the year i certainly understand sort of the expectation but as we look at the h8 et cetera theres just not a lot of visibility from the outside so would be curious to hear any thoughts that you have and kind of what gives you confidence into that trajectory bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure well let me kind of tee it up and then ill ask don to talk about commercial and brendan and talk about consumer but what i would say is that on the commercial side theres a lot of cash on the sidelines with investors with pe funds that is looking for opportunities to go to work were seeing ma pipelines weve had a record quarter for ma in the fourth quarter and we see good pipelines coming into the year citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 so i think related to kind of increased transactions and money going into the market that should spur some financing opportunities so that would probably be the big thing the other thing is that line draws are at historic lows were probably running at and we historically were at weve briefly touched when everybody drew down their cash at the height of the covid worries so i think as the economy picks up we should start to see more real investment in the economy which also gives us some expectation that the second half could see that line utilization pull up a bit and then on the consumer side we just have such a broad array of portfolios and lending opportunities many of which benefit from the low rate environment so mortgage should still continue to see heavy level of originations and the student loan refinancing business has also been strong and we would expect to see that continue as well we talk about our pointofsale financing business with citizens pay weve continued to grow the customer base and see some real opportunities for that business as well so ill stop there thats kind of the headlines and maybe don you could talk a little deeper about commercial donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id say first thing to note is client activity is really high right now and the conversations across the entire or id say of client base are at completely different levels than they were six months ago so everybody was hunkered down in their bunkers trying to build liquidity trying to refinance their balance sheets and that was the theme for i think bruce said it correctly i think as we get into the back end of and we begin to get some economic recovery which i think will happen we think a lot of those conversations will turn into transactions and were seeing really record ma pipelines were seeing record capital markets pipelines right now and were seeing just a ton of clients looking to take advantage of what could be a recovering economy and remember that the good news here is that a lot of the companies that we were worried about six months ago now have huge cash balances on their balance sheet so weve moved beyond the credit concerns and now into the opportunistic activities of individual ceos and individual boards of how do they want to climb out of the pandemic and i just am seeing a very different level of confidence everywhere except for very small business which i hope the stimulus package will begin to build that confidence in the smaller companies too bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah great brendan how about consumer brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure i guess ill just start on a quick point on credit we continue to have confidence that the health of the consumer is relatively strong and while were not out of the woods all indicators suggests strength which gives us confidence to lend money into the economy our forbearance levels are as low as theyve been which has probably dominated by a mortgage where we have great cltv coverage and our delinquency rates are the lowest theyve been in quite some time so you put that together it gives us from a banking perspective confidence that the consumer area is a safe place to stimulate growth just hitting on a couple of the assets bruce mentioned mortgage we expect a run up in originations next year as john pointed out margins will come down but well see some balance sheet growth as we project the citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 mortgage markets to potentially hit around trillion which is a bit up yearoveryear which is very strong student loan refinancing a lot like mortgage in a down rate environment has a little bit of a boomlet so our normalized quarterly originations for student loan refi was about million prior to rates ticking down in  we hit million so we continue to see a very strong uptick in demand there which by the way theres an incredibly strong customer for the future of this franchise a young high credit profile customer that weve got a lot of aspirations to grow the rest of the bank pointofsale in the nonapple part of the portfolio basically tripled in its size with all the new partners that weve brought onboard and we continue to expect that to be the case with strong growth in and lastly id just say our auto business has printed some of the highest returns weve seen in quite some time through the back half of this year and while we still think that we are in a reasonably good spot for concentration longterm and want to moderate the growth in auto we opportunistically given the cash that we have on hand see some opportunities for very moderate growth in auto to suck up some of the excess cash that we have on hand with a very short duration asset that will burn off pretty quickly so all in all were pretty confident in the ability to drive pretty substantial consumer growth next year bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thanks for the question scott operator your next question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank go ahead your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi good morning matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc theres obviously been very strong deposit growth for the industry including at citizens but do you have any sense of how much of that might be sticky kind of longerterm here obviously youve invested in the treasury management business which arguably has brought in some deposits but how do you frame kind of what might be sticky versus what will leave when central banks start to unwind a bit john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill jump in there matt and yeah we have seen significant deposit flows and we do think some of this will stick around just gave us the opportunity to optimize on the deposit side where we have significant rundown going on in the term deposit side of things and youre seeing dda increase and it gives us an opportunity to interact with those customers more deeply citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 but we do think a good portion of these deposits will be sticky youve got like the balanced parking has held on longer than we thought stimulus will rise and we suspect that some of that will run down and as you think about cash balances in we do expect cash balances to come down gradually over the year but thats not all due to deposits running off its really us optimizing our deposits and deploying those deposits into loan growth throughout the year so a good portion of it will stick around brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island all right matt let me add one point on the consumer side when you scrape away the surge deposits the last three years leading up to covid we have been performing top of peer set on low cost deposits and when we try to scrape that away in we believe thats still the case and thats driven by underlying indiscernible consumer engagement metrics in the consumer bank and so i believe were in a very strong position putting all the covid surge deposit aside to continue to outperform peers for at least the next months donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah let me just add one thing that on the commercial side our treasury sales were up last year on the back of a lot of the investment that weve made over the last four to five years in that business so not all of that will result in dda growth but some of it will some will be fees and some of it will be dda so were seeing sales momentum on the treasury side which is quite healthy matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and somewhat related whats your appetite to add securities either at these yields or what a price point going forward obviously youre optimistic on growing loans which is going to absorb some of the deposits and liquidity as you mentioned but how are you thinking about the securities book where we are seeing some banks grow it quite meaningfully even as rates come down for mortgagebackeds thank you john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thanks for that matt i mean weve been patient on this through call the second half of and have held off and allowed cash balances to rise like many have as well and in part the reason for that was given the levels for mortgagebackeds which is where we primarily operate in our securities book the levels there were not attractive as you get into the early part of the levels have improved a little bit and so we may find ourselves considering investing the cash flows that we otherwise would get back on prepayments lets say later in the quarter february or march we may find ourselves investing some of that in january sort of a preinvestment if you will and then stop and see where that plays out but you wont see us going in heavily reinvesting all of this cash in longterm mortgagebacked securities i mean i think that to the extent that we want to capture a little bit of this rate rise early in the quarter weve done a little bit of that and we may do a little more if rates continue to hang in or possibly rise but its more of a dollar cost averaging situation and put a little bit to work and wait and see rather than piling all this cash into securities at these levels citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i would just add matt that to me its really terrific that we have this much cash because a it prefunds the loan growth and thats really where were targeting the loan growth will be better than securities growth in our view and it also allows us to take reasonably aggressive pricing actions to drive some of the balances away so weve got our game plan here if we see a little flexup in securities rates were ready to engage but at this point were being fairly disciplined and cautious matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of erika najarian with bank of america your line is open one moment ms najarian your line is open go ahead erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch my first question bruce is on the buyback process for this year heard you loud and clear that the board authorized million and so i guess this is a twopart question number one are you opting in or opting out of participating in this years stress test and if opting out does that give you leeway in terms of your repurchase size and what is the timing of that million bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure maybe ill start and john can add some color but we havent made the determination yet as to whether well opt in or opt out and theres some nuances that could be tailwinds for us and then also the bloated balance sheets and the feds model runs expenses based on the size of your balance sheet that could be a headwind so were kind of calibrating that we have to make a decision by february john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island but it got extended to march bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island march citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay great thanks for that last minute color john indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island this gives a little more time to mull it over but regardless of whether we opt in or opt out we have plenty of flexibility here to buy back our stock and i think we can be reasonably aggressive the thing thats more the limiter for us is going to be our capital range which is our internal targets of to not really worried about hitting the stress capital buffer so we set the program up with a big enough size that i think we can neutralize the earnings after rwa growth and theres some wildcards as to how big the reserve release could be so i think we have a decent amount of authorization to cover that if we get favorability on that so we would expect most of this would be executed this year but it could easily go over into next year and some of that depends on the amount of loan growth and the amount of the reserve release any color john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah no i think thats right i mean they just gave us a little bit of flexibility there in terms of i think its now april where we can take our time and determine whether it makes sense to opt in but i think bruce laid it out well in terms of the tradeoffs which really weve seen some changes in the fed model that would help our ppnr profile and the fact that we keep generating high levels of ppnr is good as it relates to how they forecast as we understand it on some of the history so thats real positive that might lean us towards opting in but then as bruce articulated we also now understand that all of this cash that were holding shows up in total assets and then we understand that the model basically converts that into expenses that were somehow going to incur and so were going to have to frankly just put pen to paper here and calculate what we think the benefits are of opting in well also get to see the scenario and evaluate all of that but more importantly the scb is not our constraint and its basically our operating levels and so its sort of an academic exercise in a lot of ways in terms of whether we opt in or not this coming year and i think bruce handled the buyback question erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and my second question is on your noninterest expense outlook really appreciate slide which breaks down how you budgeted getting from to and i guess my question here is is this to outlook fully reflective of what sounds like a more optimistic outlook for second half loan growth as well as mortgage volumes and if any of those components disappoint does that slide you at the lower end of the range or out of the range i guess im thinking if revenues disappoints what would this look like citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think we always maintain flexibility to cap down expenses if were not seeing the revenues come through obviously earlier in the year you have visibility and make that call youre going to have a bigger impact on the expense base in the current year you can see on that slide erika that theres volumedriven expenses that would be the first ones to adjust and they could adjust even lower than that range but then some of the strategic investments that were making we could space those out a bit as well and then we could always go back to the well and look to upsize the top program again so i think theres a number of avenues we have and levers that we can pull if it came to that at this point however were pretty sanguine that the economy is going to be recovering and itll be a little slower going in the first half of the year but actually pick up quite nicely in the second half year so thats the call that were making john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i might just jump in and add that mortgages creates a fair bit of variability on the expense line and if you just kind of normalize for mortgage expenses noninterest expense is flat really from to to so and i think thats an important point bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island ex the mortgage growth john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ex the mortgage growth if you just kind of normalize it back to levels and that sort of allows us to on an exmortgage basis to be continuing to drive positive operating leverage throughout each of those years which is important erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch very helpful thank you operator your next question will come to the line of john pancari with evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 john pancari q analyst evercore isi wanted to see if you could bruce possibly give us your updated thoughts on ma just given your capital levels and given the opportunities that youre starting to see develop on the banking side and on the capital markets side wanted to get your thoughts on both on the whole bank side as well as nonbanks particularly i know youve mentioned the capital markets opportunity so interested if youre exploring deepening your banking capabilities on that front thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure well it was a relatively quiet year for us in not for lack of trying so we certainly looked at a number of things and had a number of conversations but we remain very disciplined buyers in terms of the financial profile that we need to see and then also the strategic and cultural fit and so well continue to i think have outreach and engage in those dialogues and well see if we can get some things done in just in terms of our focus weve been consistently focused over the last several years on augmenting our capabilities in terms of acquiring feebased businesses so we can do more for our customers that was one of the gaps that we had from the ipo days was that we werent at scale in certain activities that are quite important and are important to our customers so i think weve pretty much addressed the mortgage area weve yet to fully address the wealth opportunity and so were still active in conversations in the wealth space and then also in ma weve gone a long way towards cementing that capability here but there could be selective opportunities for us to augment our industry vertical approach with some boutique acquisitions in terms of whole bank we i think see whats going on that theres a race for scale and there may be some things that turn out to be interesting there but weve been quite disciplined in our approach there and weve really just prioritized organic growth prioritize the growth of our digital bank wed have to see something that made a lot of sense from a financial standpoint customer base capabilities geography for us to move in that direction but were certainly open to it and well kind of keep the periscope out and see if theres anything that makes sense john pancari q analyst evercore isi thank you thats helpful and then separately on the regarding your merchant partnerships just wonder if you could give us an update there on how theyve been performing have theyve been performing as expected when it comes to the returns from those programs and are you expecting to add more this year thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island ill ask brendan to handle that one brendan brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah short answer is yes they have when you look at the credit performance of the merchant business again while were not out of the woods on the environment around us the delinquency on that asset has been flat to down and the percentage of those customers that found their way into forbearance is negligible and so the citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 portfolio was operating essentially like theres no recession going on around us and thats a lot driven by the positive select of the customer base and the frictionless digital experience that we created that the payment gets automatically drafted out of the customers account every month and so were very encouraged by the size of credit performance the return to the business are credit cardlike but the risk profile seems to be lower than credit cardlike so youre getting outsized returns from the portfolio than you otherwise would expect so were excited about that as i mentioned were also excited about the growth that we generated in we had two or three key partners entering the year were going to exit the year with to and as john teased in about a weeks time well have a relatively large announcement about another big partnership that we got to play in the introduction of citizens pay which is sort of our new platform that really takes that business to the next level were very very encouraged by the opportunity in the marketplace and our firstmover advantage youre seeing more and more talk about this in the industry retailers and merchants are now looking at this as a way that they can dramatically improve their sales in a down economy and so were getting more and more inbound calls from companies looking for us to help them reengineer their sales process and try to give them a revenue boost so were very excited about this we think its very distinctive part of citizens and we remain poised to capitalize on the opportunity john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you operator your next question will come from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc go ahead your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning bruce good morning john bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hey gerard john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc john can you share with us obviously you guys have been very clear about the outlook for credit which is good for and loan loss reserve releasing that you and your peers are very likely to see because of the improving economy especially in the second half of the year can you tell us what you think the loan loss reserve to loans will get to because if i recall based on your data i think the postcecl reserve level on january was youre obviously well above that do you think thats is that a targeted area that we should kind of look to in the future or will it be something higher citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think its a good question gerard i mean i think that its a good sort of anchor point when you look back at something in the neighborhood of on day one cecl the one thing that we think about regarding that is that we hadnt had a credit cycle for close to i guess around a decade leading into that so there was a probability weighting that would expect a credit cycle to happen sometime over the horizon of the cecl sort of projection and so in some ways we think that whats going on now theres the decks are getting cleared out we certainly had a cycle and were going through one and so in terms of the resting point for our coverage ratios its unlikely to be higher than that i mean i think it would be in that neighborhood there are some arguments that would suggest that maybe it could be a little lower but maybe given mix and other things it could be a little higher but youve got to think about all those things and we wouldnt expect it to be much higher than that and in terms of timing i mean your guess is thoughtfully as good as mine but we do think that things improve pretty significantly here in were going to move relatively down pretty significantly from our current levels which are quite high as you get into the end of the year were going to be heading towards that level that i talked about the timing of that is really given cecl it happens pretty quickly i mean if the economic environment continues to improve and when you think about it we got an improved economic environment just here in january that wasnt even reflected in our results for the fourth quarter if that trajectory continues we could start heading towards that level as you get towards the end of the year bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just add to that though i think gerard you have to look at this really over time and i think well get part of the way so that well be somewhere between where we are in that or as john said maybe slightly better resting place a lot has to play out in terms of economic recovery and how much stimulus and all of that so i think well make strides certainly below and on the way towards getting down there but itll be somewhere in the middle and well have to see how things play out gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good we like that trajectory for you and your peers a bigger picture question for you bruce your outlook is quite optimistic which we concur with so were with you on what we expect as well from you and your peers when you go down the elevator at night whats the risk that you worry about because there just seems to be so many positives over the next months potentially for all the banks including your own and i always worry about something out on the field like obviously nobody knew the pandemic was going to be as bad as it was but what do you worry about when you go down the elevator at night bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i guess were getting increasing comfort that with the vaccinations with the stimulus that the economic outlook is improving and that we will have recovery next year so i wouldnt that may have been a big worry in i think its less a worry today going down the elevator i think you go back to managing other risks for example the whole cyber and fraud risk thats out there is something that is top of mind and all the banks are spending a hell of a lot of time making sure that our customer assets are safe and the way were running things citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 data is safe et cetera so that is i think a big focal point for us and other banks and id kind of keep that at the top of the list at this point anything else brendan i guess competition would be the next thing is that certainly we faced intense competition since the ipo from allcomers from the mega banks from peers from smaller banks from nonbanks fintechs and so continuing to really delight our customers and do a great job for our customers so they have no desire to switch given all the competition thats out there its one of the reasons that weve been really motivated to go out and invest in technology and invest in customer experience invest in new capabilities so we can do more for our customers really to cement those customer relationships and so if i had to pick a close second that would probably be the second thing on my list guys anything else youd add brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island i would just think that the industry going through such a transformation accelerated by covid with digital just the speed and pace of executing on a very substantial change and i feel exceptionally confident about where were positioned the markets moving fast and i think the banks that can execute the best on that will be in the winners circle at the end of the next two years time and were making the right investments i think but its a quite sizable change bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island change management thats probably number three yeah i agree thanks for the question gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of ken usdin with jefferies your line is open amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc hi everyone this is amanda larsen on for ken john can you talk about whats embedded in your nii guide for ppp income in and how that compares to maybe just touch on the income earned in and the amount of forgiveness in dollars and notionals john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure yeah i mean i think when you big picture and are pretty similar on the nii line and nim there might have been a little dropoff coming from round one had round two not come in but just the way we our outlook for round two which just started in earnest actually and is going quite well for us over the last hours and brendan may actually give us a few comments on that but in general pretty similar profile from compared to citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 forgiveness the way we account as you may know in round one we have been amortizing over the twoyear period in round one the deferred fees and so the farther you get into this twoyear period the lower the impact on forgiveness and so forgiveness is actually not a very big impact in and it wont either be in or as well its pretty stable and so thats basically best way to talk about bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island just maybe we could pivot and brendan you could just offer a view on the latest ppp program because were up and running and accepting apps and we are off to a terrific start yesterday brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah absolutely and the latest round of ppp started yesterday as bruce and john mentioned embedded in our outlook has less than half of the originations that we saw in the first round the first day was exceptionally strong we executed incredibly well we ended overnight with a little bit shy of applications technology worked really really well and pushed up a little bit over billion in application so tbd on the funding but its heavily heavily driven by ppp round one borrowers and so weve got confidence the conversion rate will be pretty high existing customers of ours so were very very pleased by our performance on day one and we expect the demand to be pretty strong over the next couple of weeks here so well know more in the coming weeks on the size and if this pushes up higher than we thought tbd its hard to get a full gauge on the demand given the state of our small businesses but all signs from day one are very positive amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc okay great and then for my next question i guess it seems to be a trend that most banks are guiding to costs higher than consensus expectations for largely driven by investment spend would you characterize your investment spend as an acceleration or a pull forward of future strategic initiatives as a result of the pandemic or something else or do you believe the million in strategic initiative is a reasonable amount of new spend for a typical year and i have a quick followup after that if i can stay on bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think we have worked really hard over the years to try to protect our investment spend in strategic initiatives so top has been a big contributor of delivering positive operating leverage but it also allows us to selffund the things that we need to keep positioning us for future growth and growth in our top line so i think that million feels right and i think the banks that are going to come out of the pandemic well are the ones that are continuing to look for opportunities to advantage their position in areas where they see opportunity and where they have strength amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc okay that makes sense and then do you have an expectation for nonrecurring expenses or charges you may incur as a result of the upside to top in thank you citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john why dont you take that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island the reported versus underlying difference john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think yes that is yes but at a lesser pace and magnitude that you would have seen in and much of that would be likely concentrated in the first half and tapering off so a lot of the costs associated with our activity in have actually been incurred in but again therell be a little bit more in the first half but tapering off throughout the year and at a lower magnitude yearoveryear amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc okay fabulous thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay operator your next question will come from line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley your line is open kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi great thanks actually just staying on the nim topic if i got all the numbers right it sounds like your fullyear nim guidance is call it roughly your first quarter is which means over the course of the year your nim should actually improve pretty noticeably can you just talk about the drivers there is it either and how much of the drivers are the lower cash balances you expect versus the higher 10year assumption thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and take that i mean i think we do expect that cash balances will dissipate throughout as we mentioned earlier we are aggressively running down our term deposit levels and optimizing deposits in general so youre going to get a nice mix shift in deposits that would drive some positive contribution towards net interest margin and then just pricing outside of mix our interestbearing deposit costs we expect to fall were at basis points in the fourth quarter we expect to drive that into the low to midteens by the end of the year and thatll happen citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 again also gradually quarterbyquarter as we go throughout the year and then the other item id highlight is that with long end of the curve weve got some steepening going on maybe not as much as earlier in the month but certainly still some steepening that has occurred and more steepening that we think will likely occur over so therefore that front book back book drag thats been happening starts to the magnitude of that starts to also moderate as we put more money to work through loan growth so those are the drivers that i would highlight throughout today bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island if i can add to that too ken i mean i think were trying to show what the nim is ex the excess cash and its quite significant its basis points higher and actually  to  we were up a basis point but i think the analysts community has been very very very focused almost to the point of being obsessed with nim the nim number with these elevated cash becomes a little less clear and so trying to think about nii really as the beacon here were focused on managing nii were focused on trying to hold the underlying nim and then when we have all this cash how do we put it to work smartly how do we get loan growth be cautious on securities as we discussed earlier but really try to keep nii performing well thats the shift i think that were feeling here inside citizens kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc completely makes sense and just a separate followup question your nco guidance if youre already at basis points and your guidance is sort of basis points to basis points how do you see that playing out i mean should chargeoff stay relatively stable sort of over the course of the year do you expect any particular quarter like second quarter or third quarter to be a little more elevated sort of a hill shape versus a steady state chargeoffs thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well yeah its a little bit volatile on the commercial side as we saw back in  so you can get hit with a tall tree and the numbers can move around a little bit but generally speaking right now weve got really great trends in all the credit metrics on the commercial side so i think the first half of the year looks really good where you have the most visibility i think going out into the second half of the year youve got to see whats how fast do we get to life as we knew it from the vaccinations and then how does that positively benefit commercial real estate if it goes well then you could continue to see subdued levels if you see some issues come to the surface because things go a little less well then i think thats a room for potential increase but still i think within under control kind of in the realm of being under control and then on the consumer side we have kind of alltime great metrics in terms of delinquencies and performance and we have had folks come out of forbearance and interestingly of those people coming out of forbearance are current and so weve been able to cross that bridge and not disturb the kind of really good credit metrics we have theres certainly now with additional stimulus and being targeted for the industries and the people working in those industries most affected by covid theres more hope and ability for those folks to get back on their feet so you could see we i think were thinking that pre this last round of stimulus and talk about more stimulus that we could see an uptick in the second half of the year but i think its less clear that were actually going to see that and that can continue to kick out into the future than maybe just go away so id say were pretty sanguine at this point but you have to expect the unexpected so thats why we have the range that we do citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you operator your next question will come from the line of saul martinez with ubs your line is open saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning just want to sharpen the pencil a little bit on an earlier response to amandas question but specifically are you assuming for ppp forgiveness on round one and new origination on round two on your mid to highsingledigit eop loan growth because it would seem like even the net number is something of a headwind in so if you could just help us fill in the gaps there john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i got it and just talk to that i mean i think as i mentioned yearoveryear the contribution to nii in from the ppp round one will be similar to the contribution we expect in from round one and round two together on the nii line and the forgiveness piece which was potentially quite significant in is now no longer so because we recognize a portion of all of those deferred fees every quarter as you click through every quarter that goes by weve been recognizing in nii a portion of what one might accelerate upon forgiveness such that as you get into the first quarter that the numbers are not that great theyre singledigit millions and so from that perspective forgiveness is not a big story anymore with respect to at least the way we account for things and we amortize the stuff pretty ratably over the twoyear period so the contributions are stable yearoveryear bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i would just add a little color on that is that the first program kind of stays level with the second half and the first half of next year and that its the second the new ppp program that kind of prevents a falloff in the second half of the year so if you want to think about it that way were kind of at relatively stable revenue levels on the existing programs through the first half of the year we would have had a falloff but now that we have the new ppp we kind of avoid having that falloff john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and one other point saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc i guess my if i could just interject a little bit here because were kind of running out of time sorry to interrupt but i guess my question thats helpful color my question was on loan growth though not nii the mid to high single digit it does it would presumably that has some forgiveness on the billion and an accelerated runoff of that which is a headwind but you also have some new origination on round two i guess my question is netnet how much of a headwind is that embedded into your mid to highsingle digit loan growth citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah just real quick in terms of dollars as brendan mentioned earlier its less than half of our originations on the frontend so when you think about our average spot loan balances were about billion dollars at the end of on this program that falls to something in the neighborhood of billion to billion by the end of so you can basically get a sense for the fact that were making up for that with the other categories saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc so theres real headwind essentially okay john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well there is a headwind were overcoming it with the other categories outside of ppp theres a shrinkage in loan growth yearoveryear that we had to overcome with other categories saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc so theres about billion to billion headwind net ie forgiveness how much is being how much of the round one is coming down versus how much new origination on round two netnet that is a headwind bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thats one of the reasons that were guiding to high spot loan growth but the average loan growth is less john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thats one of the reasons saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right okay okay because it would seem that if i think about youre not going to it doesnt seem like there would be much growth and it would be fairly minimal in the first half of the year which would imply the second half acceleration that on the surface seems extremely rapid in the third and fourth quarter with annualized loan growth being i dont know the exact number but being very very rapid and it seems i mean i hear everything you say but it does seem like youre really giving yourselves and the banks a lot of the benefit of the doubt that the economic recovery will translate at a very very rapid loan growth so im just curious if you how strongly you disagree with that logic bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 well were standing by the guidance were giving and i think you have to recall we went through each of the portfolios earlier in the call and we have probably more sales out in terms of an ability to capture loan growth than our peers and weve demonstrated that consistently since the ipo brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island i would just say on the consumer side while an economic recovery is expected and will help the originations that weve embedded in our guidance were ramping them up right now in todays current economic upside i dont know that were betting on a massive upswing thats fully dependent on our loan growth i think we can deliver were going to start delivering it right now bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah okay thank you saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thank you very much operator and due to time constraints we have time for one more question which will come from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research your line is open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning i had a question on your capital targets by our math your stress capital buffer was up around basis points in the december stress test up about basis points from the june stress test and that suggests required capital of around or less which is a fair amount below your target range so my question is could we see your target range come down over time i believe you mentioned john that the scb is not your constraint but rather your operating levels could you expand on that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill just start off and bruce may add in here but yeah i mean i think our current target is to and the implied levels from scb would be well below that from the middle part of the year from the june test we had an scb of you add that to the required minimum of and you get a thats the official scb unless and until the fed decides to change it and they have up until march to bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and if i could just interject we think thats too high because theyre not following ppnr correctly john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island correct citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island so we set pretty much lower than that even at it does come back to prudent and conservatism so john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean i think target levels from where we want to see our ratings shake out what we view in terms of managing the risks of the platform would be well north of the so it just doesnt come into play in a lot of ways even though we do think its too high so yeah i mean i think the other point we would make we said over the years that we dont think our platform is any riskier than our peer sets and if the economic environment and the group believes if capital levels decline over time as we clear the decks postpandemic we wouldnt see our capital levels needing to be higher than the average of our peers and who knows well see but right now our board and management and bruce have worked on this target range which we believe will serve us and allowing us to navigate through the pandemic and indiscernible theres a possibility bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island in good times and bad john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah in good times and bad thats the way to describe it bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thanks bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thats helpful thank you if i could squeeze in one last one i wanted to follow up on your comments around the securities portfolio can you discuss what kind of reinvestment rates youre seeing relative to the that saw this quarter i was hoping you could discuss how much curve steepening we would need to see for the downward pressure from reinvestment rates to abate particularly since it looks like some of the dynamics from qe have led agency mbs spreads to turn negative and you guys have a pretty sizable portion of your investment portfolio in the asset class john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think reinvestment yields are in the call it the to range and thats creating a call it to basis point front book back book drag given whats running off the back book runoff is in call it the to range so thats been a phenomenon thats been occurring over the last couple of quarters we are watching oass oass were positive last quarter even though yields are up oass have tightened a little bit this quarter as i also mentioned earlier we get about million of cash flow a month and from timetotime well invest cash flows in advance of coming months and we did a little bit of that in june but were not going to put a lot of citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 cash to work in this kind of rate environment unless and until yields begin to rise a bit more and oass look a bit more favorable so were doing a little bit of investing there to get ahead of some things but not a lot bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay great thank you bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you thank you guys for squeezing me in bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure okay is that all at this point operator there are no further questions in queue bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay great so thanks everyone for dialing
