delivering record levels of preprovision profit and were managing risks on our balance sheet well in the near term while also preserving and making the strategic investments to position us for growth and success in the long term financial performance in  featured record revenue fee income and mortgage results the low rate and flat yield curve environment puts pressure on nim but our wellpositioned mortgage business has performed citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 exceptionally well capturing the refi opportunity gaining market share and providing a natural offset to low rates we included a page on this business in our investor deck in short we believe the mortgage business has room to run given a positive market environment plus our own strong positioning and capabilities in addition to mortgage we saw a solid quarter in capital markets revenue given strong advisory and underwriting performance and a nice rebound in wealth fees consumer fees also continue to move higher off of the covid related lockdown lows which should continue as the economy further reopens and consumer behavior normalizes these factors drove noninterest income growth of sequential quarter and yearonyear combined with a modest decline in nii and broadly stable expenses we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of sequential quarter and yearonyear our preprovision net revenue grew by yearonyear and its up on a yeartodate basis now this capital generation ranks near the top of peers and has allowed us to grow loans to support customers build a prudent level of credit reserves given the uncertainty of the environment maintain an attractive dividend payout while delivering a cet1 ratio which is within our targeted range of to this capital and reserve strength gives us tremendous financial flexibility going forward from a strategic and an operational perspective our view on the economy continues to be cautiously optimistic our consumer credit book is tracking favorable to expectations given past stimulus economic reopening and forbearance on the commercial side we are seeing some selective credit stress in industry segments that are most impacted by covid19 and the lockdowns we took sizable chargeoffs on two credits during the quarter as loss recognition can be a little lumpy that said we feel we are near peak chargeoffs in commercial assuming the macro environment stays on the current trajectory our work on top and bso continues to make solid progress we are adding material work streams to top largely centered on digitization and we will provide a full expense guide on our yearend call on bso we completed a student loan sale as we develop an originatetodistribute model and we executed an attractive sub debt exchange that delivered both financial and regulatory capital benefits its been quite a remarkable year and we feel weve handled the challenges well and were poised for success as the economy recovers with that let me turn it over to john for a thorough review of our financials john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone lets start with a brief overview of our headlines for the quarter starting on page this was an outstanding quarter for citizens despite the ongoing challenges in the operating environment we have generated record revenue and ppnr in last two quarters with an excellent balance sheet position at september for the third quarter we reported underlying net income of million eps of and record revenue of billion our underlying rotce was ppnr increased linked quarter to another record level and was up yearoveryear we posted record fee income for the quarter faced by record mortgage fees and strong results in capital markets and wealth also we delivered positive operating leverage of linked quarter and yearoveryear as we continued our strong expense discipline citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 net interest income was down linked quarter due to a decline in loans given line draw pay downs and a basis point reduction in nim due to rates and elevated cash this was mitigated by excellent results in interest bearing deposit costs which fell basis points linked quarter to basis points i should note that on a normalized basis which adjusts for ppp loans commercial line repayments and the education loan sale completed in the quarter average loans were up slightly linked quarter we increased our allowance for credit losses to billion which translates to a prudent acl coverage ratio of excluding ppp loans up from last quarter note that the reserve build during the quarter of million impacted eps by and rotce by percentage points we believe chargeoffs should be stable in  and barring a deterioration in economic outlook we should start to see reserve releases beginning in the fourth quarter even with a significant reserve build we demonstrated excellent balance sheet strength ending the quarter with a cet1 ratio of up basis points linked quarter and back within our precovid operating level of approximately to and liquidity ratios also improved as we ended the quarter with an ldr of and we remain in compliance with the lcr our tangible book value per share is at quarter end up compared with a year ago on page ill cover net interest income net interest income was down linked quarter given the impact of lower rates and a decrease in loans as line draws were repaid partly offset by lower interestbearing deposit costs and improved deposit mix despite the challenging rate environment net interest margin held up well down basis points this quarter rates drove a basis point decrease through lower asset yields and higher cash balances were a basis point impact these were partially offset by lower interestbearing deposit costs and outsized growth in dda moving to page we delivered record results again this quarter in fees reflecting our ongoing efforts to invest in and diversify our revenue streams underlying noninterest income was up linked quarter and year overyear as our fee income ratio improved to mortgage banking delivered record results again this quarter on continued strength in originations more than offsetting the modest decline in margins compared to last quarters alltime high the mortgage business continues to provide an excellent natural hedge as intended against low rate pressure on nii the wealth business rebounded nicely in the quarter with revenues rebounding to record levels this was driven by a strong increase in transaction volume and a solid increase in aum service charges and card fees continue to trend back to precovid levels key consumer drivers were increases in credit card purchase volume and debit card transaction volume each of which is nearing precovid activity levels capital market fees were down linked quarter driven primarily by a recovery in trading values in the prior quarter excluding this capital market fees were up driven by accelerating activity in loan syndications and ma advisory turning to page lets take a closer look at the mortgage business the strong performance of the mortgage business again this quarter has really boosted our overall performance providing diversification in this lowrate environment the business continues to demonstrate the benefits of the scale and diversity of our origination channels off the back of our acquisition of franklin american we have made significant investments in the citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 business over the last few years upgrading our customerfacing technology with our focus on innovating the customer experience over of retail applications are now completed through our digital app the strength of our multichannel distribution capabilities has enabled us to meet the extraordinary increase in demand in the market with the largest year for mortgage originations in us history we expect volumes to remain elevated through at todays rates and we expect to make market share gains even as rates rise as we transition to a more purchasedriven market given our strength and execution consistency and leveraging our scale and channel diversification across our retail correspondent and wholesale channels turning to page on expenses underlying noninterest expense was down slightly linked quarter reflecting continued strong expense discipline that generated robust positive operating leverage in the quarter this continued expense discipline has contributed to the yearoveryear and linked quarter improvement in the efficiency ratio now at salaries and employee benefits were relatively stable linked quarter and up year overyear due to expenses connected to strong mortgage banking production volumes next on page average core loans were down linked quarter and up slightly after normalizing for the impact of ppp loans commercial line repayments and loan sales we saw growth in consumer lending in both mortgage and student moving to page average deposits were broadly stable linked quarter and up yearoveryear as consumers and small businesses benefited from government stimulus and clients build liquidity we were especially pleased with our progress on deposit costs which ph went or basis points to basis points during the quarter interestbearing deposit costs were down basis points to basis points we executed our deposit playbook to manage down deposit costs across all channels while improving our overall funding mix we brought interestbearing deposit costs down significantly by leveraging data and analytics to personalize offers and optimize pricing for our affluent and mass affluent customers we continue to see a shift towards lowercost categories with average dda growth of on a linked quarter basis and yearoveryear this continues the peerleading momentum we have demonstrated in growing lowcost deposits over the last three years turning to page to discuss our cecl methodology and reserves we have summarized the key aspects of our macroeconomic scenario which is a foundational element of the cecl reserve estimate this scenario has improved slightly on that used in  nonetheless we use management overlays and qualitative factors to build reserves focusing on expected performance trends in specific commercial sector portfolios most impacted by covidrelated lockdowns namely retail and hospitalityrelated cre and casual dining as well as in selected retail products we feel we are well reserved at this point for extended pandemic and lockdown impacts from these sectors notwithstanding the sizable reserve build our cet1 ratio improved basis points to given our robust ppnr growth and lower rwas on page we provide detail on our customer forbearance programs in commercial loans with payment deferrals declined to of our commercial loan book down from at june and this is further decreased to as of october for retail loans in forbearance have declined to compared to at june and have further declined to as of october this would be approximately if we reported forbearance ending immediately after the last deferred payment the performance of customers that have exited forbearance is trending well with approximately in current status also for customers that have not taken any forbearance the delinquency status is trending favorably citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 deferrals in business banking were and are expected to decrease to approximately by the end of october with about of our customers having received ppp funds and reopenings alleviating some of the stress turning to page on credit nonaccrual loans increased linked quarter given a million increase in commercial which was driven by two credits to mall reits impacted by covidrelated lockdowns and as well as a million increase in retail note that our total mall reit exposure is approximately million with two credits now in npa status and the other performing okay net chargeoffs were basis points this quarter driven by two large credits in commercial one to a mall reit and one in metals and mining the increase in commercial was partially offset by an improvement in retail reflecting the impact of forbearance and the improving economic backdrop in  we took a prudent million reserve build this quarter which increased our coverage ratio from in to in the excluding ppp loans despite the somewhat lumpy increase in npas and chargeoffs during the quarter were seeing broad signs of progress in commercial credit quality as the economy recovers in the appendix on page we provide you with an update on our view of the commercial portfolio in the commercial portfolio as businesses have reopened and liquidity has improved from capital raising and federal stimulus we have seen sectors begin to stabilize these include accommodation and food services credits including quick service food concepts that have performed well during the pandemic the retail trade sector getting our portfolio of lower risk gas stations and essential services the less pricesensitive credits and the energy and related sector and finally the arts entertainment and recreation sector as sports teams and stadiums that have further benefited from professional sports resuming given these positive trends the areas we consider to be of elevated concern have dropped from in to approximately of total loans the remaining areas of concern have been particularly hit by covidrelated closures mainly across retailrelated cre and hospitality casual dining retail trade educational services and pricesensitive energy on page as i mentioned earlier we feel well positioned to manage through the current environment with strong capital and liquidity positions our cet1 ratio improved to up basis points linked quarter given our strong ppnr generation and reduction in riskweighted assets we are now back in our target range of to ppnr as a percentage of average assets was yeartodate on a ninequarter dfast calculation basis and has increased steadily over the last five years reflecting the benefits of investments and increasingly diversified revenue base strong deposit growth outpaced loan growth which improved our liquidity metrics and drove the spot ldr down to during third quarter the company completed a subordinated debt exchange that will benefit total capital going forward by increasing the percentage of qualifying tier debt turning to page ill update you on top we continue to execute on the transformational and traditional top program and theyve clearly been instrumental in our ability to deliver positive operating leverage and drive rotce improvement the initiatives we launched are expected to achieve the original pretax run rate target of million and we are still on track to hit the million to million by yearend we are also adding significant work streams to top largely focused on accelerating our digital capabilities to create increased efficiencies and frictionless customer experiences these should deliver at least million run rate by the end of and we are working to increase this though we are also working through the cost impact citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 of how much well invest or reinvest in strategic initiatives to drive future growth we will be updating our expense outlook including the benefit of the expanded initiatives to upscale these programs as part of our earnings call in january on pages and i want to highlight some exciting things that are happening across the company as we continue to strategically invest through the crisis to position us well for the medium term we are focused not only on digitization but also initiatives that position the franchise well for the long term on the consumer side we are focused on national expansion with citizens access integrating some of our lending businesses to further develop our national value proposition in merchant finance we are continuing to add new merchants to our pointofsale platform launching five important new merchant finance partners with more in the pipeline and we are piloting a new customerled point ofsale value proposition in commercial we continue to expand our capital and global markets capabilities including completing our first leadleft highyield fixed income issuance and we are also seeing increased client adoption of our digital treasury solutions now lets move to page for high level commentary on the outlook for the fourth quarter we expect nii to be broadly stable with no expectation of ppp forgiveness benefit until next year nim is expected to be down low to midsingle digit loans should be stable securities up modestly fee income is expected to be down midteens after a record third quarter level reflecting lower mortgage banking fees while we expect to see mortgage results come down from record levels we do see a significant feeing opportunity that should continue into and well into at attractive margins albeit lower than recent historic highs noninterest expense is expected to be up modestly reflecting seasonal factors and were on track for a fullyear operating leverage of around we expect relatively stable net chargeoffs in the range of to basis points of average loans we also expect a reserve release in  given reserve builds taken yeartodate and we should see a decline in npas on slide to sum up we continue to navigate successfully through the covid19 crisis the resilience of the franchise is again on display with record ppnr record fee income and positive operating leverage we remain well positioned to continue to strategically invest and deliver on key initiatives our ability to execute well drives our strong profitability capital and liquidity positions with that ill hand it over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john operator lets open it up for the qa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 question and answer section operator okay operator instructions your first question comes from the line of peter winter from wedbush securities please go ahead peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hey good morning peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i was just curious what gives you the confidence that nonperforming assets are going to decline and at this point in the cycle there still seems a lot of uncertainty that youd be willing to release reserves next quarter bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah why dont i start john and then you could pick in so if you look at what drove up the npas this quarter it really was isolated to just two exposures we had to mall reits which frankly had been really stellar performing companies best in class which weve had long relationships with but obviously the covid and lockdowns and changed behavior caused some stress there and so weve recognized that we do a pretty careful job of forecasting migration through criticized assets and what could go npa and so we think beyond that we dont really as i think john said in his prepared remarks were seeing some broad signs of optimism and some improvement in the overall commercial book so we really dont think were going to be taking a lot new in and then well have some chargeoffs some degree of chargeoffs which will reduce the npa so you put that all together and i think were feeling pretty confident on the commercial side and then if you look at consumer as well weve had really really healthy trends even surprising to the point of being surprising but very solid in terms of delinquencies so we feel really good there as well john do you want to add to that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean id just add just higher level we have pretty good line of sight when you think about over the next to days about whats going to migrate on the commercial side i mean weve got pay downs and chargeoffs that are coming through things are as we mentioned in our overall areas of market concern we were at last quarter that number has fallen to we delineated where the puts and takes are with respect to that in our slide deck and so weve done a bottomsup cash burn analysis which don can comment on so we feel reasonably comfortable with that guide on the nonaccruals basis citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc and just on the reserve levels with releasing reserves just i feel like theres still enough uncertainty in the economy just what gives you indiscernible decision to release possibly release reserves next quarter john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean ill go ahead and take that one i think this comes back to the methodology of cecl in the first place i mean weve been over time theres been significant uncertainty with respect to the scenario and you saw how that trajectory played out over the first and second quarter where we built in both quarters this quarter the scenario actually got a little better and i think at least from what we can see the level of uncertainty has started to shape into something that we feel comfortable with our outlook i think the difference this quarter in terms of our build is weve been spending a lot of time with individual sector reviews and that really was those management overlays and the qualitative factors are what drove our build this quarter after weve gotten through all of that when we if the scenario barring a deterioration in the environment we feel like after analyzing what we expect the loss content to be in these categories that the reserving requirements have been satisfied and so therefore the loss content has been provided for and therefore on a goforward basis the way cecl works is that you would charge off against the reserves that youve already built and the provisions would be driven by your origination and goforward activities so from our standpoint that would mean reserve releases with provisions less than chargeoffs peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thats great thanks for taking my question bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian from bank of america please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island morning citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch as we take a step back obviously unfortunately given the timing of where we are in the year im sure youll get a lot of questions on and i know youll defer us to january for details but as we take a step back and we think about all the work that youve done either through the top program and building your fee incomegenerating capabilities and weigh that against obviously the interest rate challenges and the swap income rolloff as we think about normalized return sort of post the spike in credit that we all expect for as i think about normalized rotce for citizens sort of in a postcovid recovery world with no help with rates do you think that you have enough in the tail with top or fee generation to achieve like a or lowdoubledigit rotce on the other side bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill start then again john you can add your perspective but yeah i think thats certainly the case erika so if you look at what we deliver just this quarter was with a huge reserve build which the build basically cost us of rotce so you can do the math on that but well i think going forward have lower credit costs well have some nim headwinds but again we consider hedges as part of the strategy in managing a low rate environment but our mortgage business was also part of that strategy as well and so there seems to be a great fixation on hedging and some folks have put hedges on i think weve done a nice job there but some folks may have some longer duration or more hedges but they dont have the sized mortgage business that we have and so i think if you look at our ppnr generation through this year were really top of the class in terms of how weve been performing so we expect there to be linked to run in the mortgage business through next year of the households in the country would benefit id say by more than basis points in terms of the math if they refinance their mortgage so theres going to be continued demand on the refi side as the market goes back to a purchase market we also are very well positioned we probably have the most diversified origination channels of any bankowned mortgage company with exposure to retail to correspondent and wholesale weve worked really hard to digitize that business and gain market share and be able to handle volumes efficiently so i feel really good about that so id say were kind of on the doorstep of crashing through double digit rotce i think we can get there and certainly sustain it but its going to take all the levers of the fee investments that weve made doing more top and continuing to focus on driving efficiencies looking for volume in terms of loan growth and we see we think theres going to be some opportunities we think we uniquely have some niches on the consumer side that some of our peers dont have and i think also in commercial weve been able to achieve nice growth through the build out of some of our regional geographies so we know what we have to do we know what the objective is and were going to keep driving towards that original medium term targets i think you probably need a little help from rates to get all the way there but certainly double digit seems like a bar we can hurdle john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think ive not too much to add other than i think that we have been a selfhelp story in the past and i think we absolutely remain so going forward in the nii space our bso actions and with interestbearing deposit costs at around basis points theres a lot of opportunity there for us we are a completely different bank than we this ph serp versus last and so you can expect that our interestbearing deposit costs are going to find new lows for the bank compared to what we were at the end of the last ph serp citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 on fees its night and day with respect to our diversification a combination of the organic investments that weve made and the inorganic acquisitions that weve made have been extremely powerful in the fee generation space as youre seeing in mortgage but we shouldnt forget about wealth which is hovering around record levels on its own but sometimes gets overshadowed by the eye popping numbers in mortgage but the diversification there is great and the capital markets business has never been more diversified and then finally expenses weve had a history of our top programs that will continue that will be a hallmark of what we do and we have a lot more opportunity there as well so those are the final points id make bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you for taking the question bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i just wanted to ask on credit broadly what is your sense for when loss content will really begin to materialize i think it kind of feels like it keeps getting pushed back and the consensus now seems to be sort of mid to even late so just curious to hear your thoughts and then just at a very top level what kind of cycle do you really think youre sort of setting yourselves up for it seems like with current info most of the economy will sort of slog through and its just these isolated areas that will see the real pain so is this something where we could really resolve most of the credit cycle next year or do we see this sort of bleeding on for a couple of years from here bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure so what id say on that is you have to look at commercial and you have to look at consumer consumer has been extremely well behaved and weve had folks on forbearance the people rolling off forbearance have actually been current and we havent seen any uptick in chargeoffs but i think the residual folks who are on forbearance there will be some chargeoff content there and i think that probably doesnt peak until sometime in the middle of next year so whether thats  or  well see i think on the commercial side weve got hit with two oneoffs this quarter and theres the pig is going through the python i dont think theres significant jumps on the commercial side i think were probably nearing the peak chargeoffs but theyll stay elevated for a while before they move back down i think in the second half of the citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 year so id say our outlook is that most of this should resolve over the course of next year setting us up for i think more normalized chargeoff rates as we head towards r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island any comments brendan you want to comment on the consumer side at all brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah let me just add a little specificity so john quoted a few numbers in forbearance were increasingly confident that that portfolio is of high quality particularly with some portfolios that were of high interest that hadnt gone through a cycle before our student portfolio is holding up incredibly well so far and the merchant finance portfolio is equally holding up incredibly well and in fact that portfolio has almost no customers in forbearance at all and delinquency is still flat for precovid so were feeling really really strong about consumer as john mentioned the customers that are firmly still in forbearance has moved from a peak of ever forbearance at to now and our delinquency rates have been flat to down at the same time so were seeing a lot of gearing out of the forbearance portfolio with very minimal impact to distressed consumer behavior so far so were out of the woods but surprising yeah but on the green the green shoots that were seeing are quite positive bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and don maybe you want to talk about donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id echo that and i do think its kind of elevated for next year but were kind of peeking out where we are right now i think remember and ill just emphasize what bruce said our view is based on a clientbyclient liquidity analysis where we project out current rates of cash generation versus current rates of cash burn and were seeing really positive trends weve taken of the companies that were in the high risk category out of that category based on our last analysis were also seeing record level of customer deposits so they have heavy levels of liquidity sitting with us and were seeing on a customerbycustomer basis were seeing the bigger customers as everybody knows going to the public markets and grabbing any amount of liquidity they can get in the high yield in the equity markets and the smaller customers while theyre having a little bit of a more difficult time theyre managing their businesses in a really conservative way for cash so theyve kind of cut expense levels and theyre positioning their businesses to survive an extended slowdown if there is an extended slowdown so we feel good about what customers are doing on an individual basis citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island great r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thats perfect color thank you very much and i guess bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i sneak one in here just bruce you noted the kind of emerging emphasis on things like hedging programs which you guys have benefited from ive noticed the same thing i guess maybe john as you sort of think about things into next year when and how do we see some of those hedges that you guys put in place roll off and sort of what is the sense should we just sort of recast our focus onto the fee drivers such as mortgage and wealth that you alluded to earlier or how do we kind of replace those benefits as they do roll off john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean basically the hedges that are in place roll off throughout by the end of most of that benefit is starting to wane but what i do is take a step back on nim overall the levers that were pulling and have very large opportunity to get after as what i mentioned earlier with respect to interestbearing deposit costs sitting at basis points we expect those to decline significantly in thats on the sort of funding side of things we also are focusing on the asset side so we have broader bso efforts rotating our capital and allocating it into better riskreturn categories and profiles and then youve heard from bruce earlier the mortgage business has room to run there are trillions of dollars of mortgages that have a refinance incentive and i think that i would say that we have that business is rate sensitive and has been part of our hedging story and has done incredibly well and a lot of at the nim headwinds frankly i guess i could say most of the headwinds all of it in and probably on a cumulative basis through most of those rate headwinds will be offset by expected mortgage fee elevated mortgage fee revenues so and then of course you heard when you have rates falling thats a big impact and well have to look at all the levers across the selfhelp that we feel like is alive and well here and that would include expenses and top is part of that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah the last thing i would say scott and i know hope is not a strategy but if you consider that we could see real progress on the health front and you could get these treatments are progressing nicely vaccines are progressing you could see another stimulus build it seems like the folks in washington are getting closer on that you could actually see a fairly decent rebound next year which could result in a steep in the curve citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah yeah bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island it would create a lot of benefits and also opportunities to lay on some more hedges so anyway were keeping our eye on that but i dont know john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah we may be indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah when you run your scenarios you have to consider that as a possible scenario r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thats perfect operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john pancari q analyst evercore isi also on the credit front i know you mentioned that youre closely tracking loss migration and that has influenced your commentary around nonperforming asset levels likely to decline can you just give us do you have what your total criticized assets trends were for the third quarter and how that may break down in terms of the special mentioned versus classified bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 yeah we published that in the q i would say directionally its up and its mostly special mentioned so youll stay tuned for the details on that john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thanks bruce and then also on the credit side i wanted to see if you could just give us a little bit of update on what youre seeing in your commercial real estate portfolio are you beginning to see stress there i know you mentioned the mall reits but just curious about other properties how that portfolio is trajecting it looks like you added a fair amount to the reserve this quarter there john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think its really what we mentioned its retail and hospitality where were focused if you click through the different asset classes office looks like its holding up pretty well with rents being paid well multifamily looks like its holding up pretty well weve got our eye on trends there bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island we dont have the big exposure to some of the cities indiscernible john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island right right bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island they get tips like new york and san francisco fortunately john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and then we get into industrial and healthcare and those are also holding up quite well so the place for focus is on the retail and hospitality on the hospitality side weve got exposure to business travel which has obviously slowed but weve got very diversified sponsors and weve got some support provided by those sponsors in terms of flag change which have overlay guarantees on some of that so its really around the other areas of retail and we feel like were in pretty good shape with the reserves weve put up at this point bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think what we tried to do here was really look at it for an extended period of either lockdowns or consumer behavioral shifts that goes well into and that puts more stress on these narrow sectors lets make sure weve taken credit off the table and put up a sizable reserve there john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and the other thing id mention is we are working with all of the sponsors we really bank the best sponsors out there and theyre working with us and theyre restructuring the properties that are having temporary dislocation citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 so weve given some forbearance but theyre also putting some money into pay interest and keep the properties operate john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you thats helpful if i could just ask one more on the efficiency the million just to confirm we do not yet know how much will fall to the bottom line of that million bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thats good john so we conveyed we communicated appropriately so we are going to were working on launching a number of work streams some of those are in brendans area in consumer the big digitization push and so far the tally is up to at least million so thats good news and were going to keep trying to drive that higher we also have a couple pages in there and some of our strategic initiatives and so one of our objectives here is to really keep investing for our future so that we come out of this challenging period in even better position with a stronger franchise thats positioned to grow and to continue to do well and so were working through the pacing of some of those investments and which ones to prioritize so were kind of reluctant at this point to give you a full update on expense guidance until we complete that work but im sure we knew there was going to be a clamoring for what have you got so far so weve put the number out there stay tuned to january well give you all of that in the context of our fullyear guidance that we do every january earnings call john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks bruce bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc oh thanks good morning guys bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey if i could just follow up on the last question a little bit so top youre on track and you still have another million to million by yearend and then the new million on top of that im not looking for expense guidance but just can you help us understand of that million to million that you at minimum you citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 expect to get next year the approximate mix of like what comes through expenses of that and what comes through revenues of that because youre talking about like these new revenue opportunities as you just alluded to bruce thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and take that i mean i think in the majority of this is an expensedriven program there are some revenue opportunities that are there in the traditional top program as we have done historically but for example the transformation piece of this is expenses for the most part and i would say that thats really the main driver of the program but we also do use the program to fund revenue opportunities as well and to drive upside on that front i would hasten to add though that when you start doing the numbers youre looking at a run rate target of around million by the end of this year that rises to as high as million so theres million there and then we also mentioned the additional million at least that bruce mentioned as well so we wanted to make sure that we werent losing track of those different hundreds bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah exactly yeah okay very good and then second question just john on the ppp in general many banks have thought through that forgiveness might start in the fourth quarter it seems like you guys are conservative in terms of not at least putting it in your core your nii guide but can you just help us understand and i know its more of a timing question but just what you expect and how do you expect just all go with regards to forgiveness timing and also just how much was ppp in the nii as well thanks guys appreciate it john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure ill start off and maybe brendan will comment on it but in terms of process i mean the forgiveness process can take up to five months theres many steps that have to be made maybe brendan can talk about the invitation approach that were taking in the fourth quarter but i think that our view is given the complexity there that it would be appropriate to in the outlook to not include any acceleration with respect to forgiveness benefit that said we do as you know the way the accounting works is that we are incorporating the expected fees on a ph net yield basis over the life of the months of these loans and so every quarter that goes by we are recognizing pl that is attributable to the ppp program in the third quarter the yield on the program is nearing somewhere between nearing in terms of yield and from a pretax standpoint if you its maybe in the million range for the third quarter so that gives you a sense on all of that when i call it pretax all of that thats really after the expenses its a tiny bit higher on the nii line and that number will be with no citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 forgiveness but well see that again in a similar number in the fourth quarter given the way that the accounting works and if forgiveness is really a event as we are forecasting bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i would say one thing on that its bruce and then ill let brendan go but ken initially we take it out over roughly eight quarters and i think we had million million roughly to amortize on a straight line basis but we thought that forgiveness would occur much sooner we had thought some of that would trickle into  and  but now it looks like that will largely be a first half of event but the spike is going to be lower since the longer this goes towards the end of the period then you wont get the same spike as if you had a massive acceleration into say  that would have really altered the timing in a material way but at this point since we are steadily recognizing and then theres less time remaining to accelerate the spike shouldnt be as dramatic just to just make that mathematical point brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island on the timing the one thing i would just add is keep in mind the customer doesnt need to incur interest charges until october of next year and so theres no huge pressure point for our customers to apply for forgiveness right the second and so with john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island they dont have to pay brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island they dont have to pay so with the various builds going through congress that would possibly be quite positive to these customers theres a bit of a waiting game and thats what were hearing from most customers is that theyd rather wait and see what flexibility is afforded to them before they jump in and start the forgiveness process so were getting a handful trickle then and then to johns point once the customer provides all their documentation the sba still has a threemonth window to stamp it and say yes its able to be forgiven and thats the recognition event is when the sba stamps it so theres a bit of a tail on this we expect that as bruce pointed and john pointed out to be a indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island a few two things some small business owners are being cautious here and just holding on to that cash to see what the forgiveness turns indiscernible they might have to pay it back which one of the reasons we still have elevated cash balances so theyve dipped into their own pocket to keep the lights going in the business and so i think theres just a bit of caution generally as we said ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 understood hey one just quick clarification john that million pretax was at the fee part of it or was that also with the nii adjusted from the loan yield john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thats the fee part of it and the nii so its all in and thats consumer and commercial ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay so thats the all in what you had from ppp thanks operator your next question comes from the line of ken zerbe from morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks so just in terms of credit it sounds like the management overlays sort of most of the reserve build this quarter what did your cecl model if we look at cecl by itself actually tell you to do with the reserves bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i think its hard to parse it ken actually because to us the cecl model is not just a macro forecast its a process that involves many many many variables and management judgment is one of those variables so i think its just hard to parse that ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay then maybe just on the same topic i guess why apply that management overlays this quarter im sure you had some earlier in the year but it seems like maybe this quarter had more of the qualitative adjustments rather than indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think weve had overlays and qualitative factors are part of the process every quarter i think the reason to call these out was you had a slight divergence it looked like the macro forecast was a little better the backdrop was a little better but what were seeing is that consumer behavior and the effect of lockdowns is going to be more prolonged than i think we saw when we were assessing it in the first quarter and second quarter we think it could be well into before we get back to life as we knew it and to normal lifestyle which means these retail and hospitality entertainment travel all of that genre could still be in a difficult situation for longer so you wouldnt necessarily pick that up from your macro forecast i mean thats a kind of unique aspect of certain businesses are disproportionately impacted from the new normal about how were living our life and so thats why were calling that out ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja from jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi a couple of im going to just follow up on some of the themes that have been coming up the release in reserves bruce and john that youre expecting in the fourth quarter which loan categories do you think that youre expecting to see that at this point where is that visibility coming from john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean ill go and take that vivek its kind of like the way cecl works as you know i mean we provide for all of the loans that are outstanding at september both for the loss content that we see after considering our macroeconomic scenario and then our qualitative factors that we reviewed by loan category and if were right and its very hard to say that you can be theres so much uncertainty that a lot of that build as you know in the third quarter came through the commercial portfolios and as we mentioned earlier cre retail and hospitality and we also mentioned casual dining as sectors where we built reserves so once thats done then theoretically at least youre just going to charge off against those reserves going forward assuming you were right about what the loss content is and what the scenario will be the rest of your provisioning then would only be focused on your front book activity and growth so where were going to grow going forward lets say for example in the residential mortgage and student ph emergent spaces we would provide additional reserves for those loans as they come on as well as the ci loans that were going to see as you get to the end of the fourth quarter so it really is you have to sort of look at it in those two buckets as indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and just make an assumption that the environment wont deteriorate in a meaningful way so that you wouldnt need to add to any further reserves around the back book now there could be some of that but we dont see it a sufficient amount of it to result in a reserve build and a need for reserve build vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and what are you thinking about the student loan book because that forbearance rate has stayed pretty high it hasnt come down its higher than even resi mortgages can you comment on why thats the case have they just not come up or how long is the forbearance period have they just not come up yet or have they gone what percentage have gone in for an extension of the deferral donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island so were actually starting to see it gear down a little bit in the recent weeks it was lagging a little bit principally because the majority of our student loan book is student loan refi and a lot of those customers also have government loans which had significant forbearance periods that were automatically granted and so customers were triggered by the government events and they called all the private lenders and banks and raised their hand for forbearance and theres sort of no reason for them to delink those two so weve been aggressively working citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 with our customers to make sure we try to understand where theyre at and if they have the capacity to pay but if they are still on the fence weve been allowing them a little bit of leeway to land on their feet but every underlying dynamic we see in that portfolio is quite positive recall its a super prime portfolio the credit is ph million plus in that portfolio and particularly in the refi portfolio theyll make sixfigure income and thats the sector thats been the least impacted by unemployment and so we feel quite strong that this is theres no significant underlying dynamic thats different in student than any other portfolio in consumer vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez from ubs please go ahead saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning guys good morning a couple of questions first john you mentioned that the hedges should mostly roll off and the headwinds from the hedges rolling off should be pretty for the most part fully realized by the end of and early and i think weve estimated that the headwind is probably in the million million annualized from the hedges rolling off can you is that i mean can you just give us a sense of the magnitude of the incremental headwinds if our number is more or less right and how should we see those incremental headwinds sort of materializing in and in john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah it would be a fraction of that without really getting into the numbers its not nearly that big its not saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island its nowhere near that from what we can see how we track through i mean youve got to think about what the terms are which we publish and you can see what the terms are on those swaps i believe but its much much lower than that and id say we just bring it back bigger picture to ensure those are running off but mortgage business has been part of our hedging strategy all along a majority of the nim headwinds on a cumulative basis are being offset in and by the mortgage business and we also have a very significant lever with respect to interestbearing deposit costs this time around in ph serp given all of the investments weve made in the analytics and product capabilities and orientation of our bank across consumer and commercial with respect to the relationshipdriven deposit gathering that we have embarked upon which takes years to do but that started many years ago so were starting to see that bear fruit those are the things i think about when youre trying to consider the puts and takes for next year saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 yeah i get that but maybe we can go with the mechanics offline but there does seem to be a sense from the investment community that the headwinds are were talking about on a static basis not factoring in some of the offsets are in the hundreds of millions of dollars but just to be clear youre saying that that estimate just on a static basis nothing else just the hedges rolling off that that number is way too high is that right john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thats correct thats correct and we can take you through the math on that offline with some publicly available information and well just make sure that youre seeing it the way we see it saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay just one other question on nii what are you assuming for forgiveness ultimately throughout the course of the first half of next year what percentage of loans john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island so theres a tail that we think will be forgiven on the backend and so the other will come through mostly in but theres some thatll come through in the third quarter as well saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thanks a lot bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay is that it kristin silberberg a head of investor relations citizens financial group inc rhode island no one more just we got bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island one more question okay well take one more question operator the next question comes from the line of dave rochester from compass point please go ahead dave rochester q analyst compass point hey good morning guys bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 dave rochester q analyst compass point hi just on your nim guidance was just curious how much deposit growth youre assuming that feeds into that if any or if youre looking for more of that continued favorable mix shift that youve been having there favoring the lower cost of deposits go ahead john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah its primarily a mix shift story i mean weve gotten surge deposits like many other banks we think some of that may stick around for quite a while in through well into so theres that benefit weve paid down everything you can pay down and were sitting around with some excess cash and so excess cash is a drag on nim call it about a basis point drag or so on a quarteroverquarter basis in the fourth quarter but its getting up to near call it to basis points on an absolute basis in the fourth quarter all that excess cash well look to see that pay down over time but as it relates to deposits really were seeing great mix shift into dda weve had i think three years running now pure leading dda growth and thats part of the mix story and its just accelerating that trend that already was happening with us thats nice to see on the deposit side dave rochester q analyst compass point yeah well you mentioned the cash thats sitting there i mean are there any lumpy maturities on the borrowing side that maybe you can take advantage of and use some of that cash to pay those down anything over the next year that we can look forward thats indiscernible john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean its not a lot so our flow of funds are down to zero and then our senior debt we only have very very modest maturities coming in in early bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island we just called one issue and we did a sub debt exchange so were working that as much as we can but not a huge amount of opportunity there donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yes dave rochester q analyst compass point all right and then if you guys have any color on new loan yields and securities purchase yields that you guys are seeing today im just trying to get a sense for where we could ultimately be going on the average earning asset yields if we continue to see this flat curve over the next couple of years john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 yeah and so for securities ill take and maybe don or brendan want to talk about spreads but i mean on the loans side but its not a great story on the securities side theres a basis point just call it negative front book back book in terms of runoff which comes off at around call it basis points and youve got reinvestment coming on at around or basis points on the front book for securities so thats the story there i think in commercial were seeing strong sort of spreads are up but rates are down so thats good in the consumer side of things were seeing some interesting positive trends there in auto which has been quite good and really strong spreads there and maybe ill just let don or brendan add anything else donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think auto has been very strong student loan refi has also been very strong were seeing a significant increase in margin across basically all the products so i feel bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island we have also talked merchant we just had a nice string of wins and donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah apple just launched their is launching their new product brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island our merchant business kind of has a profile of a credit card business apple were gearing in so the new product release for them right now with the phones so were enthusiastic about that microsoft all access has geared up for this big launch right now seasonally we just launched as john pointed out earlier five new merchant partners really centered in home improvement electronics and fitness similar to our peloton relationship with the firm so were really bullish about the growth there and were actually getting some really decent momentum that should really help offset some of the yield headwind from some of the other portfolios by bringing them something in that high yield john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah on commercial were generally getting anywhere from to basis points better spreads on new originations and were also putting libor force and a lot of transactions which are helping the overall yield that seems to be holding bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay all right thanks for the question dave rochester q analyst compass point yeah appreciate it citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay i think thats it for the queue thanks again for dialing in today everyone we appreciate your interest and support have a great day and everybody
