and resilience of our business model we also announced further commitments to diversity and inclusion along with initiatives to promote racial equity and social justice our financial performance in the second quarter featured tremendous revenue generation and strong profitability in our mortgage business we made an important investment in acquiring franklin american mortgage company in may in order to gain scale and diversify origination channels in the business in addition weve made investments in talent customer experience and in digitizing and streamlining the business which has positioned us well to capture the market opportunities weve seen since the middle of last year these strong results have been a ballast to windward during the lowrate environment and disruptions arising from the pandemic overall our fees were up yearonyear and sequential quarter with stable net interest income total revenue was up yearonyear and sequential quarter we did a good job on expenses which resulted in positive operating leverage yearonyear a underlying efficiency ratio and ppnr growth of yearonyear ph and to plug in chargeoffs as our credit costs in  we had a record quarterly citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 earnings of as expected however we again built our credit reserves under cecl given the deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions since the close of the first quarter our acl to loans ratio is now and thats excluding ppp loans in addition we are selling a long duration student loan portfolio which freed up additional reserves for reallocation we feel we have good coverage now with the credit risks in both the consumer and commercial portfolios though uncertainty on the path of economic recovery remains we have updated the granular information on credit portfolios including some additional metrics in the appendix to our earnings presentation so take a look the strong ppnr generation and reduction in commercial line draws during the quarter helped improve our cet1 ratio to which is up from in the first quarter we had a very liquid balance sheet during the quarter with average deposit growth of sequential quarter spot our spot ldr at quarterend was or sic excluding ppp loans so overall we have a very strong capital liquidity and funding position that allows us to use our balance sheet in support of our customers we continue to track well on all of our key strategic initiatives for and weve been working on refreshing our strategy to incorporate key trends and learnings from the crisis we aim to take advantage of some of the opportunities we see to come out of the crisis wellpositioned for future growth now i hope you and your families are coping with the current challenges and remain healthy and safe with that let me turn it over to john for a thorough review of our financials john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce and good morning everyone lets start with a brief overview of our headlines for the quarter as bruce said this is an outstanding quarter for citizens against a difficult operating backdrop this allows us to head into the second half of the year with good momentum and excellent balance sheet strength the resilience of the franchise is on display as we generated of eps on an underlying basis this was driven by record revenues and fee income given record mortgage fees which offset headwinds in several other fee categories net interest income was stable linked quarter given the strong loan growth which offset a basis point decline in margin this was driven by lower rates and higher cash balances that we did well on cutting deposit costs in half we increased our allowance for credit losses to billion which translates to an acl coverage ratio of ex ppp up from last quarter we showed excellent balance sheet strength ending the quarter with a stronger cet1 ratio of up basis points linked quarter our liquidity ratio has also improved as we ended the quarter with an ldr of excluding ppp loans and we remain in compliance with the lcr also our tangible book value per share is over at quarterend up compared with a year ago now let me move to the highlights of our underlying results covered on pages and even in the midst of the covid19 pandemic and another strong reserve build our results highlight the resilience of our diversified business model our eps of was down yearoveryear but up linked quarter ppnr of million was a record up yearoveryear and linked quarter and in addition to another exceptional performance in mortgage banking we also saw strong underlying performance in irp and improvement in capital markets results average loan growth was in the quarter reflecting ppp lending and the impact of the commercial line draws we saw last quarter which benefited nii and helped offset the impact of the more challenging rate environment if we adjust for the sales ppp and line draws average loans were up linked quarter citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 moving to page ill cover net interest income ph which quite well despite a lower margin net interest income was stable linked quarter as the benefit of interestearning asset growth and improved funding costs was offset by the impact of the lower rates net interest margin decreased basis points linked quarter as the impact of lower rates and higher cash balances was partially offset by lower deposit costs and outsized growth in dda and other lower cost deposits about basis points of the margin decline related to higher cash balances in the quarter given strong deposit flows as consumers and small businesses benefited from government stimulus and corporate clients built liquidity we were especially pleased with our progress on deposit costs which we drove down basis points during the quarter a more than decline our total interestbearing deposit costs were basis points at the end of the quarter that compares to basis points back in at the end of the last zirp so clearly we have a nearterm opportunity to continue to reduce these costs moving to page ill discuss fees which really showed the benefit from the work weve been weve done to build capabilities and diversify our business noninterest income was a record up on a linked quarter basis and yearoveryear record results in mortgage banking were partially offset by continued headwinds related to covid19 in other fee categories on a sequential basis mortgage banking fees increased by to million reflecting continued strong ph refi lock volumes and record high gain on sale margins in particular capital market fees of million increased million from first quarter reflecting strong dcm activity and a million sic million marktomarket recovery on loan trading assets foreign exchange and interest rate product revenues increased linked quarter before the impact of cva interest rate product sales led the way as clients repositioned for a lower rate environment cva improvement was million in the quarter trust and investment services fees were lower by million linked quarter given the rate environment and the effect of the equity market decline on managed money revenue the service charges and card fee categories were down significantly compared to first quarter reflecting the full quarter impact of the shutdown and impacts from stimulus money to customers on a positive note we see debit card activity roughly back to prepandemic level and credit card activity in june only down about compared with last year a significant improvement from the over declines we saw in early april turning to page underlying noninterest expense declined linked quarter largely driven by seasonal impacts in  on salaries and employee benefits salaries and employee benefits declined million or linked quarter largely reflecting seasonally lower payroll taxes equipment and software expense and outside services were higher linked quarter and reflect increased technology spend and investments in growth initiatives next lets discuss loan trends on page average core loans were up linked quarter primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the commercial line draws at the end of the first quarter and the billion of ppp lending to our small business customers before the impact of loan sales line draws and ppp loans core commercial loan growth was up approximately linked quarter the billion of postcovid commercial line draws in march have been substantially repaid and were down to billion by the end of the second quarter overall utilization is down to approximately from at the end of the first quarter core retail loans on a linked quarter basis were stable with growth in education and other retail offset by lower home equity balances and the transfer of approximately million of education loans to held for sale we are building an originateto distribute model for our consumer assets which will generate fee revenue and increase our balance sheet flexibility over time citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 moving to page deposit growth was exceptionally strong in the quarter we saw a robust average deposit growth of linked quarter and yearoveryear outpacing loan growth and driving our average ldr down to excluding ppp as consumers and small businesses benefited from government stimulus and clients built liquidity these strong deposit flows came in lower cost categories with average dda growth of on a linked quarter basis and yearoveryear we continue to aggressively execute our deposit playbook to manage down our deposit costs across all channels we were able to cut our interestbearing deposit costs by roughly half this quarter down basis points to basis points and down basis points yearoveryear lets move to page and cover credit we continue to assess the impact of the covid19 pandemic and are closely monitoring the portfolio for areas of potential risk that said portfolio performance is progressing largely in line with our expectations but with a somewhat more adverse macro backdrop than we saw at the end of the first quarter net chargeoffs were stable at basis points linked quarter as increases in commercial were partially offset by improvement in retail reflecting the impact of forbearance nonperforming loans increased linked quarter driven by a million increase in commercial reflecting covid lockdown impacts and an million increase in retail the nonperforming loan ratio of basis points increased basis points linked quarter and basis points yearoveryear however in spite of this increase the nonaccrual coverage ratio remained strong at at june we increased our cecl credit reserve coverage ratio from in to in excluding ppp loans this basis points increase was primarily driven by a net reserve build of million in addition approximately million of reserves associated with a planned sale of student loans were reallocated to the remaining loan portfolio in effect the reserve build was million or of the  build on page we provide detail on customer forbearance and the ppp lending program we continue to work directly with our customers to assist them through these challenging times and have seen encouraging trends the average fico score of our retail forbearance customers remains high at and approximately of these loans were current when they entered forbearance we also continue to work proactively with our commercial clients granting a relief where needed in the form of covenant modifications ph while off of ppp applications as well as granting selective temporary relief on principal and interest payments im also pleased to say that through june we helped our customers receive billion in ppp loans which has allowed us to help support over jobs of loans made were below moving to page to discuss our cecl methodology and reserves we have summarized the key aspects of our macroeconomic scenario which is a foundational element of the cecl reserve estimate at quarterend we elected to use the may moodys baseline as our base scenario similar to last quarter given the uncertainty of the continued economic outlook we also considered other moodys and internal scenarios in general our aggregate economic scenario is more severe than that used in that assumes the steep drop in gdp in is followed by a gradual recovery in the second half of the year and into if this scenario plays out provision requirements over the second half of should be more reflective of net loan growth and incorporate a smaller build however if the pandemic impacts are deeper or if it takes longer for the economy to recover or government programs are less effective than we expect then we could require further additions to reserve levels citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 on page as i mentioned earlier we feel well positioned to manage through the current environment with strong capital and liquidity positions our cet1 ratio improved to up basis points linked quarter given our strong results and a reduction in riskweighted assets additionally during the quarter we issued million of tier qualifying preferred stocks which in combination with the increase in cet1 drove a basis point increase in tier capital strong deposit growth outpaced loan growth which improved our liquidity metrics and drove the spot ldr excluding ppp loans down to turning to page lets look at reserves and capital versus stress losses our acl of billion represents a very strong of our modeled losses using the feds scenario and is now of the stress losses in the feds dfast in addition when adding excess capital above our preliminary scb of billion to our acl the resulting billion is of our estimates and of the fed loss estimates these levels are further fortified by the additional coverage from the ppnr we generate on average weve generated approximately basis points of cet1 capacity per quarter over the last six quarters on page we show a summary of the feds stress test results the fed estimated our ppnr at of average assets which is well below the peer median of we believe this ignores the steady and significant progress we have made to improve our ppnr since the ipo for example our ppnr to assets for has improved by approximately since the ipo to importantly this compares to a stable in actual ppnr to assets during the first six months reallife stress in the feds estimate of our credit losses at was right on top of the peer median and down from in however our estimated companyrun severely adverse credit loss rate of is significantly lower we believe that the feds modeled results and the preliminary scb is elevated above what our business model would imply as such and as we indicated in our ccar release in june we have submitted a request to the fed to reconsider our preliminary scb on page i want to highlight some exciting things that are happening across the company while we are first and foremost focused on helping our clients we are looking forward and continue to work towards building a better company we continue to execute on the transformational top program and are making steady progress towards our target planning is underway to add significant new transformation initiatives including the endtoend digitization of customer interactions and operations as well as other initiatives to adapt to the postcovid19 environment we are also moving forward with our major strategic revenue initiatives while considering new opportunities arising from the current environment in an effort to drive higher revenue growth coming out of the crisis moving to page we provide some commentary on how key categories are shaping up for fullyear compared to the prior year we expect net interest income to be broadly stable as loan growth is offset by a meaningful decrease in nim due to lower rates noninterest income is expected to be meaningfully driven by the exceptionally strong results in mortgage which more than offset the weakness in other fee categories related to covid19 we expect several key fee categories to benefit from a return to more normal activity levels in the second half which will help cushion a moderation in mortgage revenue noninterest expense is expected to be up modestly particularly given higher compensations tied to stronger mortgage production and impacts from covid19 which includes government lending programs and customer relief efforts provision expense is the greatest potential for variability and remains dependent on the path of the recovery citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 we expect solid loan growth driven by the impact of higher line draws in commercial during the first half and government programs like ppp as well as increased demand in education and merchant financing our capital position remains robust with our regulatory capital ratios expected to improve further over the remainder of the year driven by net income growth a moderation in rwa growth during the second half and the suspension of our buybacks through yearend looking forward we expect to remain wellcapitalized and feel confident we can continue to maintain the dividends at the current level now lets move to page for some highlevel commentary on the third quarter we expect nii to be up modestly reflecting ppp benefit on nim excluding ppp loans loan growth is projected to be down modestly due to the full quarter impact of a decline in commercial loan line utilization in the second quarter ex ppp the nim is expected to be broadly stable with the benefit of lower deposit costs being offset by ongoing rate headwinds fee income is expected to be down in the mid to high singledigit range reflecting lower mortgage banking fees from record levels partially offset by recovery in other fee categories noninterest expense is expected to be up in the low singledigit range reflecting higher originationrelated cost levels in the mortgage business we currently expect a small reserve build though provision expense will be highly dependent on an updated view of the economic recovery and portfolio performance finally we expect average loans to be down in the low singledigits given the paydown in commercial line draws during the second quarter excluding the impact of line draws ppp and loan sales we expect loan growth to be broadly stable to sum up our profitability capital and liquidity position remains strong and we are delivering well on our key initiatives for stakeholders now let me turn it back to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thank you john operator lets open it up for qa citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everybody thanks for taking the question bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i guess just sort of a toplevel question on reserving and adequacy and methodology theres of course so many moving parts now with the vast uncertainty and then the fed sort of threw a wrench into things with the ph their sort of earnings sufficiency test but just as you look at the number certainly very strong and update from the first quarter but as you think about things what makes the right number versus say some who have upped the ante to like given your own loan mix outlook et cetera how do you arrive at that conclusion given all the moving parts bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure let me start and then ill flip it to john but actually we look at it scott first off ex the ppp loans so its really r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and the folks youre referencing that are in the mid typically have very sizable card businesses and we have a de minimis card business and so if you strip out the card from the other banks the reserves on their card book theyre generally around so we feel that were right in the pack with everybody else on that basis so you cant just look at a direct kind of highlevel number you have to actually peel back and look at the individual portfolio and see what the coverage is and if you look at coverage by each of our consumer portfolios and then by our cre and our ci i think we feel quite confident that we have adequate reserves for the scenario that weve laid out and that kind of is the key you have to go through this process of choosing a base scenario contrasting with some other scenarios thinking about the impact of the government stimulus and how long it lasts and what the benefits are think about forbearance and what benefits thats providing so theres a lot of assumptions that go citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 into arriving at a new scenario and we went through that whole process and this is what we come up with if it turns out down the road that the reopening is slow and that the scenario extends the recoveries from what we assume this time theres always the chance that we have to take a further look at reserve build we did include in the slide deck on slide just a little table that says if we had another if we wanted to use up basis points of cet1 wed gain another basis points in acl coverage so the would go to so i think the broad point there is that we feel we have very strong levels of cet1 we feel we have a very robust acl ratio were also pleased that our ppnr is staying strong and resilient through the stress period and so its all those elements that give you confidence that you have ample capital to absorb any credit losses with that ill flip it to john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think you captured it bruce ill just maybe add a couple of points ph we get worse in our scenario and i think that was prudent quarteroverquarter but we did see that the consumer ends up being extremely resilient and so just given the impact of all the stimulus and forbearance so consumer has really been performing well so thats been factored into our numbers from a commercial standpoint youll notice in our materials that we increased that amount of reserve significantly we took that up from up to so we think that that was prudent and we think thats an appropriate way to express where we think we see things at this stage and then as bruce mentioned and you sort of have to look at reserves in concert with capital just in the cecl world our number is when you compare that to others at ex card and then you layer in our capital at when we look at that in the totality we feel this is an extremely strong approach to reserving and managing our capital r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right thats perfect thank you for the thoughts and then if i can slip one more in you guys have always done a very nice job of sort of getting ahead of things with your top programs always having something in the tank to support your ppnr of course the current top program is much bigger than past ones but just given the change from what we would have contemplated say a year ago when this was first put out there is there any chance to sort of revisit things maybe get even a bit more aggressive on cost savings or things like that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah so we did indicate in the materials that we are focused on some new ideas based on things were seeing through the whole pandemic period particularly the increased use of digital channels and what that portends in terms of accelerating the move to digital across our businesses and we think that offers some meaningful upside in terms of efficiencies across really distribution operations and technology so were in the process of scoping that out and theres other aspects use of virtual advisory and other things and how we work in terms of how much remote and how much office space we need theres a number of things that were looking at that i think offers some big potential for savings down the road i did mention last quarter i think that we have this effort called socalled war on paper that brendan here is championing theres a lot of paper in the consumer bank and so numerous opportunities i think to increase the scope of what were doing john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 yeah i might add that weve kind of put all of our top initiatives through the lens of a postcovid world and where were headed and we validated that not only were moving on the right path but we may even be accelerating on all of the things that were doing with nextgen tech and converting to an agile workplace and ways of working and then broadening it out as bruce mentioned as we see new opportunities in the digitization space r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thats perfect thank you guys very much appreciate it operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys i was wondering if youd just give us a little bit more detail on some of those fee drivers on the mortgage business outstanding again and you talked about expectations for it to come down a little bit but just what youre looking out for in terms of the balance between gain on sale and origination and then also you mentioned the expected improvement in some of the other line items but if you could really just walk us through service charges and what youre seeing as far as in activity how that came through the quarter and how youre expecting it to traject thank you john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and start and maybe brendan may want to chime in here but just from a mortgage banking standpoint a phenomenal phenomenal quarter in really the second quarter the story was about margins when you look at how we recognized revenue basically on pullthrough adjusted locks and those were strong i mean at elevated levels but not too different than first quarter really it was about margins that were basically doubled from and that is as high as its even been certainly record for us and possibly for the industry so thats what was happening in the second quarter when you look out into the third quarter we still see strong locks possibly even higher who knows well see but margin is coming down off of record levels we suspect that margins will hang in possibly above levels but it would be hard to predict that we would be able to sustain the margins that we saw in so thats why we expect to have another strong quarter for mortgage but maybe tempered and moderated from where we were in from a mortgage standpoint and then in the service fees and card area were seeing at the end of the quarter some better uptake in terms of activity and maybe ill just turn that over to brendan to add some color there brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think youve summarized mortgage well john indiscernible on service charges the headwind we have is around nsf and you can see in our results the enormous amount of growth in dda from the stimulus and a lot of that money is still sticking around which has a direct and adverse impact with nsf so we believe that will be largely temporary but well have some persistent pain through the rest of the year as that balance parking sticks around and ends up burning off ph through the or into next year citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 on card fees debit card as john pointed out in his prepared remarks is basically back to almost par from year overyear and credit card is getting there weve got a little bit of pain in credit card with some slowdown intentionally on balance transfer initiatives just given the state of credit while we make sure weve got our arms around it before we turn back on any growth engine in the card book so thats a lever we have once the economy stabilizes and we feel confident enough to turn it back on in the second half of the year and then i would say just lastly on wealth fees we had a bit of a reduction in wealth just given the market pullback with our managed money book which has started to recover as you know so we see some tailwinds into the second half of the year with that and sales had all but dried up in  with our branches in appointment only mode and weve seen a real material pickup in sales so managed money and transactional sale so we do expect a bit of a rebound in wealth fees in and the second half of the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and just one question on deposits the growth at periodend is almost as good as it was on average how do you assess the stickiness of that and whats coming in existing customers versus new customers thanks guys john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i mean indiscernible spot growth in the second quarter was quite strong at and yearover year so youre right its like its been hanging in extremely well theyre down a bit from the average balance growth of but hanging in quite nicely i think what were trying to do is to monitor the behavior of consumers and our commercial customers so on the consumer side we have stimulus ppp balance parking tax deferral unemployment all of those forces so basically we expect that to moderate over the remaining part of the year but it really depends upon the level of stimulus and whats happening with spending the ppp dollars and then on the commercial side we have also ppp and line draws right and so those line draws have come down by a lot they continue to run off so i suspect we will see that moderate through the rest of the year highly dependent though on further fiscal stimulus and customer behavior ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks i guess why dont we start off in terms of the student loan portfolio the million that you sold can you just talk about the rationale for doing that and also does this represent any kind of change in terms of how youre approaching the business john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 so im going to go ahead and start off here i think that really the broader context is really balance sheet efficiency and balance sheet optimization so what weve been endeavoring to do certainly in the mortgage business we have a pretty highlytuned originatetodistribute model and we also have loans and portfolio of mortgages on balance sheet and that is the we believe thats the appropriate balance is to have some balance sheet availability for consumer assets and some ability to distribute that paper so were doing that in the mortgage space of course many companies are as well but were looking to be able to migrate to that kind of balance over time in the student book in the auto book et cetera and so student is an area where we have a pretty solid origination capacity and capability and we have identified an opportunity to get to begin to migrate into the originatetodistribute arena if you will with student and therefore we with that as a good pilot transaction well be better equipped to balance portfolio lending and sales going forward and importantly were keeping the customer relationship in the sale so its truly just balance sheet optimization while maintaining the strategic customer relationships so we think its a good approach so with that ill maybe see if brendan wants to add anything brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah youve covered it well as usual the only thing i would add is in the student portfolio theres multiple different products under there one is our student loan refinance product and then the inschool portfolio is the balances we moved to held for sale which is significantly more ceclintensive than the student loan refi portfolio so and both of which we think are still very distinctive for us in customer acquisition given you start to see some market pullback with some of the bigger lenders curtailing their originations over the last quarter so we still do believe were very bullish on it we think weve got some white space here to acquire customers and well optimize the use of the balance sheet as we can and hopefully get gain on sale over time with our position bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just add too that this portfolio that weve moved to held for sale is very attractive from a yield standpoint so we think we can get a good price ultimately and execution on this and at the same time free up the reserves that we were holding against it so in effect weve taken about million and were reallocating that to other portfolios which augments the actual reserve build that we took so from a ph timely standpoint all the things john said about strategically this makes sense but it helps us boost our cet1 ratio it helps us move those reserves elsewhere to other portfolios and continue to bolster our reserve coverage ratios ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right perfect and then just maybe a second question for you just to put you on the spot a little bit about provision expense and i will say its really encouraging to see provision expense like be very much under control this quarter but when we think about provision expense going forward given your guidance i know its really hard to pin down numbers and im not trying to necessarily but when you talk about less reserve build and higher ncos i think theres a scenario where your provision expense could be higher from second quarter it could be lower than second quarter it could be meaningfully lower than second quarter and still fall within your guidance given what you know today is there i mean would you you expected provision expense to be meaningfully lower or some kind of in the middle john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 yeah ill go ahead and start off there i mean we mentioned in our outlook this is just highly dependent upon a variety of factors right bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island were in kind of may we thought a certain way in june we thought a little differently the things april we thought really a lot worse so things are going to really play out over the next to days in terms of whats going on with the rate of infection around the united states the rate of closures and i think youve got to look at that youve got to look at how our portfolio performs will the consumer remain resilient will our commercial outlook remain as expected theres just so many factors i just think that theres a lot more that we dont know than what we do know about what our provision could actually be when were sitting here in september we just feel like more broadly if things play out the way we expect that provision going forward would naturally given the way cecl works be more closely tied to loan growth than large builds going forward so i just you kind of throw all that together and its just very difficult to indicate what that expense will be bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i would just also add its kind of the economy is recovering reopenings are occurring the trend line is up but its really in a sawtooth pattern so you kind of go from month to month and youre starting to feel pretty good and then whoops youre not feeling quite as good but we put away a lot in the first half of the year and i think were cautiously optimistic that the reopening process even though were seeing kind of the sawtooth at the moment is still moving progressing in a positive direction in the second half of the year so i think that would argue unless something else happens that kind of the trend line of the provision was biggest in the first quarter it was smaller in the second quarter you could see a scenario where that continues on into  and then into  at this point ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc perfect very helpful thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch my first question good morning my first question is for you bruce clearly all the work that you did to diversify your revenue stream is paying off in spades gaap eps going from last quarter to this quarter and im sending up the question because clearly what surprised folks on the dfast results for the industry is the introduction of an income test and so as you think about the earnings power going forward and your comments on future provisions it would be great to hear from you in terms of what you believe the dividend sustainability is if the fed continues to extend this income test beyond the third quarter bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure and let me just first pick up on the efforts to diversify the business model but we aim to be good stewards of capital and i think all of the five kind of feebased acquisitions that weve done three in the ma space franklin in the mortgage space and then clarfeld in the wealth space have been really terrific theyve all met our expectations and are helping to bolster that fee income which is really helpful in this type of environment so well continue to look for those opportunities weve also made a lot of organic investment in people and capabilities and technology to bolster those areas as well when i look forward when we put out the commentary around the feds dfast results we said were quite confident that we can continue to sustain this level of dividend through the year and so if you look at the guidance that were giving the results we had today certainly the third quarter outlook and then the broader guidance were giving for the full year i think you can adjust your models and youll see that thats the case that theres going to be ample headroom to be able to sustain the dividend where it is we wont comment yet on because clearly we tend to recalibrate and offer guidance at the outset of the year on our january call but again i think the resilience that youre seeing theres no reason that that shouldnt also continue into next year erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and the second question is ph and we scoured the q before the call im wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on the losssharing agreement clearly its part of the disconnect in terms of corun losses versus fed dfast losses and maybe its also a part of why youre getting the questions on whether or not a allowance is adequate so wondering if you could share with us in a little bit more detail how much of your consumer loans does have this lossshare agreement and when the chargeoffs come how does the lossshare agreement work and protect citizens john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island im going to start off and maybe brendan is going to add here erika so just the point that were making and that weve observed is that with the fed is that in the card space there are revenue and losssharing arrangements that are maybe not predominant but certainly exist and the fed has in the last round of dfast recognized that they exist and has begun to take specific account for that in their projections of losses in card and so generally the way to think about it is that we have a very similar arrangement a revenue and losssharing arrangement with respect to our merchant finance activities with varying terms et cetera and really our point is that those need to be recognized as well even though these are not technically card assets so thats the main message on that and maybe ill turn it over to brendan to answer to react to the other points you had citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill just let me just chime in to that john though john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island but if you have the losssharing then obviously the stress losses of looking at individuals in a downturn flips to looking at your counterpartys ability to pay and cover the losssharing and the marquee partner that we have is apple which i think last time i checked has pretty damn good credit so if you make that substitution that would be very beneficial to the loss picture and theres other arrangements like that so thats just one element we actually have arguments that we put forth on ppnr we have arguments even beyond that on the credit side but anyway weve commenced that process and we think that the fed is we commend the fed for actually opening this up and allowing a dialogue around whether these results are being modeled accurately because they really matter today before it was more of a ph passfail to how are you doing but now in the scb construct it has more bite and so even though were fine wed like to kind of bring our numbers back to be more representative of our peer group of a traditional regional bank which is what we are and so theres a number of factors that are causing us to be elevated and the fed has started to deliberate and weve submitted our materials and i think well get a fair hearing on these issues brendan you want to add anything brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah the only thing i would add is we dont disclose all the ins and outs of the arrangement partnerbypartner but if you look at how indiscernible without the losssharing youd surmise that the most important indiscernible like a credit card when you add them on we projected to stress like a secured asset or even better in some cases in some cases significantly better and then if i look at it independent from the loss sharing arrangement that portfolio in real terms not picked up by the fed yet early innings here on forbearance but that portfolio the merchant portfolio is actually in singledigit basis points ph in forbearance so almost nil and the delinquency has been extraordinarily stable and so its performing as if its a superprime assets without really a recession going on around it right now which is incredibly good early signal we think a lot driven by the innovation in the customer experience design and how the automatic payments are set up so independent of the dialogue around the fed results the underlying asset we believe is really well under control and performing quite quite well bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island great erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning john and good morning bruce bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc john i have a couple of questions around the forbearance numbers and i apologize if youve already mentioned this what percentage of the loans in forbearance are making payments i know its different by category but i dont know if you have any color there and then second do you have a sense yet from the fed when their policies supporting forbearance may change requiring indiscernible reclassify the loans into different category downgrade them and put more capital against them john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill cover those points gerard so the payment data is coming in and we havent really talked about it overall but just category by category big picture were seeing north of in a couple of categories in terms of payments when you think about a payment made within the last days you could talk about a resi mortgage portfolio being north of same with our card book you can see large percentages in some of our other categories like auto and home equity maybe just short of as well in terms of having made a payment even while in forbearance in the last days so thats actually an extremely good story and it could be just kind of a convenience for certain customers ph but just as a safety net and maybe in certain respects continue to make payments so thats that as it relates to really theres a intersection of the regulators the cares act and the fasb as it relates to how we account for forbearance but by and large theres an expectation that theres a full days that would be permissible before we then bring it back to starting the clock on nonaccrual and nonaccrual basically runs approximately days thereafter so thats one of the reasons why this is getting pushed out a little bit on the consumer side lots of stimulus were keeping an eye on round two of extension requests and were and a lot of that indiscernible come off forbearance which customers are starting to come off forbearance now and then the clocks are ticking as it relates to delinquency statistics and nonaccrual but theyre all pushed out into frankly early as we see the calendar and how it all ph shaped out given that this thing started in late march early april gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 john just a technical question on the forbearance are all the loans accruing interest even the ones that are not making payments john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island we are accruing but were also putting up reserves against those accruals separately to be prudent as it relates to so we dont want to put up a bunch of accrued interest receivable that later on has to get written off so were one quarter into this and we have a separate reserve outside of cecl to just kind of prudently ensure that that accrued interest receivable number doesnt get too large and well continue to do that going forward gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just quickly bruce whats the biggest in your interpretation of the federal reserves results for the ccar and dfast numbers versus your internal models where do you see the big glaring differences and are you hopeful or confident that you can maybe get the fed to think ph your guys way bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well id say the biggest one that weve referenced over the years has been how they model ppnr which if you have to view us in a historical context where we were owned by rbs which had its challenges and citizens was forced to shrink its balance sheet which in a high fixedcost cost base causes profitability to fall dramatically and so when they were picking up data they picked up initially they overweighted that period right after the great recession which really harmed us and the banks who got tarp actually got a benefit that when you play it forward and look at when you get into a stress environment the next time we wouldnt be forced to shrink our balance sheet weve made a lot of improvements to our profitability and the other banks wouldnt get that tarp benefit so it was kind of a double whammy we had some banks with inflated estimates on ppnr and we had a decided negative one the fed announced that they have retriggered their model and are now putting more weight on recent periods but we think theyre still picking up some of that past period and so our principal argument would be for us given the journey that weve been on taking all the improvements weve releveraged the balance sheet weve invested in our feebased businesses weve done acquisitions like franklin that its not providing an accurate picture of who we are and thats worth a lot of basis points in terms of the indiscernible and the impact it has on scb and then further the things that john mentioned there are some specific things like credit like the losssharing on these merchant portfolios that arent getting picked up as well so i cant tell you i think theyre listening and i think we put good arguments forward i think if truth and justice prevail we should get something but to try to say today whether im confident or not id just say i dont know that its too early to tell gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc well good luck with that good luck bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thank you citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc bruce in your prepared remarks you talked about taking advantage of opportunities out there and obviously youre doing it on mortgage now and you mentioned some efforts to accelerate digital and look at the cost base but is there anything else that you were kind of referring to when you were making that comment whether its organic acceleration of some growth efforts or looking from an inorganic perspective just wanted to see if you could elaborate on that comment bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure ill start maybe john can add to it but one of the things matt that weve been very focused on is our we call them our strategic initiatives we did a very deep refresh of our strategy to try to look at where do we see trends and opportunities in the marketplace that maybe arent fully serviced by other competitors and where do we have capabilities and strengths where we would have a right to win and we can up with three significant initiatives one was our national digital bank is to kind of take citizens access to the next level the second was to leverage what weve done in the merchant space to have new offerings for merchants including also offerings that go direct to consumers to give them financing flexibility and choices and the third was to build out a small business and lower middle market platform rich with information and services that we think those businesses would really benefit from and coming through the pandemic weve had to refresh those and say are they all are all three full systems go do they make sense and are there things that we should do to even push harder on some of these things and id say there matt the good news is that every one of those things is hitting the target we think theres still a very big opportunity there i think we can probably get more out of the digital bank than initially anticipated probably get more out of merchant finance than anticipated i think the one thats had to stay in shackles a little bit has been the business bank initiative just because of all the effort and focus around ppp and that market is in a little citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 bit disarray so weve had to pull a lot of our people to just stay focused on the ppp program and on now the forgiveness aspect of that so that will be a little bit of a delayed start but we still like the potential there so id say those are the real unique opportunities that we see we do think like virtual wealth advice is another one that were looking hard at weve been able to operate well from a remote standpoint through this period we do have an integrated digital and banking platform that quite frankly hasnt had a lot of takeup but if we marry that and play around with the formats and potentially have the robot of kind of digital service but augmented with some folks with gray hair to provide advise at a different price point that could be an interesting proposition as well john anything you want to add to that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah indiscernible wellstated and i just would reiterate our enterprise programs and top and bso which are opportunities for us to continue to drive value and then as bruce mentioned earlier weve done well and weve been disciplined with respect to our feebased acquisitions and we continue to have interests in filling in gaps and diversifying that fee revenue profile going forward and so thats another thing that we remain interested and pursuing matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and any updated thoughts on potential bank deals it might take a little while to play out but obviously youre sitting here with a lot of capital you issued a little bit of preferred and generating good ppnr as you mentioned so some banks out there are kind of getting ready for some deals that may emerge over the next several quarters and wondering what your thoughts are on that bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah look i dont really see us making any initiatives in that direction for a while so at this point i think just following through on all the change programs we have and the investments that were making is going to be our area of focus and if we keep delivering here if we have a good credit outcome then we should benefit and be better positioned down the road potentially to do things like that but certainly not in the nearterm burner at this point matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats very clear thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs please go ahead saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hi thank you good morning thanks for taking my question citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc so john maybe can you give us more color on what ppp assumptions are embedded into your nii guide for the third quarter and for fullyear because you did say a significant amount forgiven in the third and fourth quarter which seems a little bit earlier than maybe some of your peers have indicated they were suggesting its going to be a little bit more backloaded but if you can help us understand maybe some of the assumptions for overall forgiveness timing and just help us frame this and size up the potential benefits and how much of your nii is being buttressed by ppp and how much is sort of being driven by core nii growth john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure ill throw a few thoughts out and brendan can add but the so we basically we have an assumption that approximately of the loans will be forgiven and will go to term thats the i think pretty typical but thats the way we think about it and as it relates to the profiles through the rest of the year we do think that more will be forgiven in than overall brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and so but maybe a few months ago we might have thought otherwise but things have really not gone as quickly as maybe we thought it was going to go days ago or when this thing all started out so we do have that layered in and id say that in general we were thinking that up to a half of that could come in in the second half and the rest of it will come in next year but this is one of those highly volatile things that were going to keep a close eye on which is why throughout our materials we often attempt to try to articulate what things look like ex ppp indiscernible saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay no thats super helpful so just to clarify then the about half and half this year second half of this year versus next year with a little bit this year a little bit more tilted towards the fourth quarter than the third quarter is that i guess thats a summary of it john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah thats a good summary call it maybe up to saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and thats a good summary saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay awesome just switching gears a little bit and maybe im overthinking this on the reserving and your assumption on provisions but why is the guidance implying a modest build in the third quarter and some of your peers have talked about their best guess ph as sort of that youre now fully reserved based on their assumptions of what the world is going to be and what their lifetime losses are going to be is it simply that or are there methodological points that may limit how much you can get ahead of it or is there something more fundamental driving that or is it just some element of conservatism and you just want to prepare the market or prepare people for the possibility of that if the economy worsens a little bit just a little bit more color and just want to make sure i understand what you mean by reserve build and whats driving that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think that as we said in our remarks were balancing two overall concepts in cecl one is if you had your scenario and youre accurately forecasting the performance of your portfolio then technically you would only be providing for loan growth and so on the one hand you would be releasing in many respects reserves bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island on the other hand were cognizant of we did this in the first quarter that should have been true in the first quarter where everyone built but then everyone built again in the second quarter things got worse were cognizant of theres so much uncertainty that weve articulated including the performance of our portfolio could deviate from our outlook including the macro scenario and the may baseline from moodys could be worse when we get to september baseline as well as our other internal scenarios that we look at in the way that we forecast this our loan growth trajectory could vary theres just so many variables that were trying to balance it by saying hey listen theres when you look at the probabilityweighted outcomes of all of those scenarios its very possible we could have a build that build could vary and we could have a build outside of loan that which will be required for loan growth and that would that build could vary for all the reasons that we said and thats really the color around that reserve build could exist and could be lower than it was before saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah no thanks for that just a final quick one then on the reserves even without the sales of loan you kind of moved reserves around where the consumer books resi auto i think that the reserve ratios came down and ph you really buttress it with cre and ci is that just a function of the consumer book just performing better than you expected and took that as an opportunity to maybe shore up your commercial reserves how do we read that sort of recalibration there citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think thats right i think with all of the forbearance and stimulus thats been out there i think without improvement consumers and customers have become very flushed with cash and weve done a pretty granular analysis of our customer bases balance sheets and what their cash levels are and its showing up in all of our dda and everything else and the credit quality of our backlog in consumer has improved at the end of the second quarter as compared with the end of the first quarter so that has been really an offset to the fact that the macro has actually worsened so we have on the one hand macro worsening which all else equal would have caused the need to increase reserves in consumer has been more than offset by those factors that i just described and separately the commercial customer base is actually were seeing some stress and strain there so thats actually additive to the worsening in a worsening macro environment and therefore we had a meaningful increase in commercial build required as a result of that saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc great thats really helpful thank you operator thank you indiscernible operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities please go ahead peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc hi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc you guys have done a lot of work hedging to protect the margin against the lower shortterm rates but long end of the curve continues to be under a lot of pressure im just wondering what are some things you can do to protect the nim from a lower for longer rate environment right and i heard you on the deposit side still a lot of opportunities there but just wondering what else is there john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill go ahead and just comment on that i think that our bso program on the asset side of the house where weve been optimizing our portfolio investments in the education and merchant space have been an area that has gone quite well even auto these days in terms of the pricing in auto has really become much less of a drag and is citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 actually flipping over to be contributing in the nim space so on that asset side this has been a multiyear indiscernible its a multi multiyear process to really reshape the profile of the asset side of the balance sheet and so that is clearly a big opportunity id really double down on the point that you made on deposits when you think about where we were in zirp for deposit costs we have a clear opportunity to actually lower our deposit costs in the very nearterm over the next couple of quarters below where we were in zirp even with the fact that theres a tailwind to the fact that all of our cds havent repriced yet so id really emphasize that as an opportunity and then lastly we have a pretty balanced book our fixed portfolio versus floating is about kind of equal its about and so we do have the nim is buttressed by the fact that we have that fixed duration in on the loan side and the fact that we do have hedges that remain in effect actually through the large majority or large part of so theres a number of factors that we have in place to try to protect net interest margin but more broadly margins come down in a zirp environment we think indiscernible we have good tools to really moderate it but were going to be nevertheless we cant really defy gravity forever and were going to be its going to be at the same time watching us pass the baton a little bit to the indiscernible and to expenses weve demonstrated strength in expenses and so really we look at it as a ppnr resiliency effort overall going forward peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it and just if i could follow up on loan deferrals im just curious have you made any changes to the process when a customer comes to extend a deferral and then secondly which asset classes are you kind of seeing the most pressure to extend these deferrals brendan coughlin a headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i can take that so weve got a full process around the first 90day forbearance rolling over to another days what we try to do is engage with the customer and kind of walk them through the pros and cons from their perspective of extending it youre going to capitalize interest youre not paying down your principal are you doing this for a safety net reason or do you really actually need it because youre impaired and try to coach them through it if theyre doing it from the perspective of just anxiety or a safety net that it may be better to reengage and start paying back indiscernible be better in the long run pay less interest and weve had some success doing that but at the end of the day weve made the decision to yeah be a little bit more liberal with our customers and with the uncertainty in the economy and reopening in question on the speed and timing if the customer ultimately really wants that safety net of another days to ensure they land on their feet or that they dont get knocked off a little bit then were granting that extension of a forgiveness i would say that weve seen about of the forbearance portfolio already roll off and the majority vast majority are reengaging in payments right away so were pleased with the early results its early innings but bigger vintages are going to start rolling through here in the midsummer so well know a lot more in the next days douglas levy a senior vice president investor relations director citizens financial group inc rhode island okay great citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thank you douglas levy a senior vice president investor relations director citizens financial group inc rhode island weve got one last time for one last question thank you operator and our last question comes from the line of brian klock with keefe bruyette woods please go ahead brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey and thanks doug good morning and thanks for squeezing me in just one real quick one on the expense i just wanted to ask john on you guys have done a really good job on controlling expenses and definitely in this environment its pretty difficult so good work on that and i just want to think about the math for the fullyear youre saying it could be up modestly yearoveryear so it seems like when you put in your third quarter guidance that youre implying some level of operating expenses thats probably near ph something thats closer to million and thats pretty low relative to where youve been so does that math makes sense and is that the sort of run rate to ph set up for next year for the fourth quarter john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think youve got to look at we said that wed be up modestly in in versus and theres investments that are being made in the platform there is is a big mortgage origination year so there are significant expenses of course that you have to incur when youre generating the revenue levels on the bside that we are so were keeping an eye on that but its offset by the investments that were making going forward in we said again we did reference to mortgage expense number but as i mentioned before were taking were looking at all of this in the top arena is a big year for top in terms of what we expect to accomplish there and were looking for ways to actually add initiatives to that program and to possibly different ways to continue to manage those expenses going forward brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great thanks for your time guys appreciate it bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay and i think that exhausts all the questions i do want to thank everybody for dialing in today we
