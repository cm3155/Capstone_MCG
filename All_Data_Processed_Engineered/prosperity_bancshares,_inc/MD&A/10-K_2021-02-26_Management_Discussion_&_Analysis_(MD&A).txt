integral to understanding the results reported the companys accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere is this annual report on form 10k the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity business combinations generally acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc business combinations a business combination occurs when the company acquires net assets that constitute a business and obtains control over that business business combinations are effected through the transfer of consideration consisting of cash andor common stock and are accounted for using the acquisition method accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date determining the fair value of assets and liabilities especially the loan portfolio is a process involving significant judgment regarding methods and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair values fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available the results of operations of an acquired entity are included in the companys consolidated results from acquisition date and prior periods are not restated the fair value of acquired loans incorporates assumptions regarding future credit losses and therefore no allowance for credit losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is accounted for in accordance with fasb asc measurement of credit losses on financial instruments cecl which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss methodology cecl requires a financial asset or a group of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected the allowance for credit losses is an allowance available for losses on loans and heldtomaturity securities the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses all losses are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that such a loss is likely and can be reasonably estimated recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery the companys allowance for credit losses consists of two elements specific valuation allowances based on probable losses on impaired loans and pcd loans and a general valuation allowance based on historical lifetime loan loss experience current economic conditions reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses in the companys loan portfolio based on an evaluation of the portfolio management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the banks board of directors indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance in making its evaluation management considers factors such as historical lifetime loan loss experience the amount of nonperforming assets and related collateral the volume growth and composition of the portfolio current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay and the value of collateral the evaluation of the portfolio through its internal loan review process and other relevant factors portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits however the entire allowance is available for any credit that in managements judgment should be charged off chargeoffs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible for further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses see accounting for acquired loans and the allowance for acquired credit losses financial conditionallowance for credit losses sections below and note to the consolidated financial statements accounting for acquired loans and the allowance for acquired credit losses the company accounts for its acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting accordingly the assets including loans and liabilities of the acquired entity were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date these fair value estimates associated with acquired loans and based on a discounted cash flow model include estimates related to market interest rates and undiscounted projections of future cash flows that incorporate expectations of prepayments and the amount and timing of principal interest and other cash flows as well as any shortfalls thereof on january the company adopted asu financial instrumentscredit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments cecl upon adoption of cecl all loans accounted for under asc were included in the allowance for credit losses methodology with no offset provided for any remaining fair value marks in addition all loans previously accounted for under asc had their credit marks reclassified to be included in the allowance for credit losses for further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses for acquired loans see accounting for acquired loans and the allowance for acquired credit losses at note to the consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the companys reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity under asc topic intangiblesgoodwill and othergoodwill companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining the need to perform step one of the annual test for goodwill impairment an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment described in the following paragraph for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired the company had no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at december core deposit intangible assets that are subject to amortization are being amortized on a nonpro rata basis over the years expected to be benefited which the company believes is between ten and fifteen years these core deposit intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value the company performs an evaluation annually and more frequently if a triggering event occurs of whether any impairment of the goodwill and other intangibles has occurred during the company changed its annual goodwill impairment test date from september 30th to october 1st based on the companys annual goodwill impairment test as of october management does not believe any of its goodwill is impaired as of december because the fair value of the companys equity exceeded its carrying value while the company believes no impairment existed at december under accounting standards applicable at that date different conditions or assumptions or changes in cash flows or profitability if significantly negative or unfavorable could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the companys impairment evaluation and financial condition or future results of operations fair values of financial instruments the company determines the fair market values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value there are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level inputs include quoted active market prices where available if such quoted market prices are not available level inputs are used these inputs are based upon internally developed analytical tools that primarily use observable marketbased parameters level inputs are unobservable inputs which are typically based on an entitys own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity the companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability coronavirus aid relief and economic security act nol carryback extension in response to the covid19 pandemic on march the president of the united states signed the cares act into law the cares act permits a fiveyear carryback period for nols which allowed the company to generate an anticipated tax refund and income tax benefit resulting from the tax rate differential between the current statutory tax rate of and the statutory tax rate in prior years during the carryback period pursuant to this provision

table start includes fair value discounts on acquired loans of million million million million and million at december and respectively table end the company separates its loan portfolio into two general categories of loans originated loans which are loans originated by prosperity bank and made pursuant to the companys loan policy and procedures in effect at the time the loan was made and acquired loans which are loans acquired in a business combination and preliminarily recorded at fair value at the acquisition date those acquired loans that are renewed or substantially modified after the date of the business combination are referred to as reunderwritten acquired loans if a renewal or substantial modification of an acquired loan is underwritten by the company with a new credit analysis the loan may no longer be categorized as an acquired loan for example acquired loans to one borrower may be combined into a new loan with a new loan number and categorized as an originated loan acquired loans with a fair value discount or premium at the date of the business combination that remained at the reporting date are referred to as fairvalued acquired loans all fairvalued acquired loans are further categorized into purchased creditdeteriorated loans pcd loans and nonpcd loans acquired loans with evidence of more than insignificant credit quality deterioration as of the acquisition date when compared to the origination date are classified as pcd loans the following table s summarize the companys originated and acquired loan p ortfolios broken out into originated

consumer and other total loans held for investment total table end the company offers a broad range of short to mediumterm commercial loans primarily collateralized to businesses for working capital including inventory and receivables business expansion including acquisitions of real estate and improvements and the purchase of equipment and machinery historically the company has originated loans for its own account including loans in the family residential category and has not securitized its loans however the company does originate longerterm residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market the purpose of a particular loan generally determines its structure loans to borrowers with aggregate debt relationships over million and below million are evaluated and acted upon on a daily basis by two of the companywide loan concurrence officers loans to borrowers with aggregate debt relationships above million are evaluated and acted upon by an officers loan committee that meets weekly commercial and industrial loans in nearly all cases the companys commercial loans are made in the companys market areas and are underwritten on the basis of the borrowers ability to service the debt from income working capital loans are primarily collateralized by shortterm assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by longterm assets as a general practice term loans are secured by any available real estate equipment or other assets owned by the borrower both working capital and term loans are typically supported by a personal guaranty of a principal in general commercial loans involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans and therefore usually yield a higher return the increased risk in commercial loans is due to the type of collateral securing these loans as well as the expectation that commercial loans generally will be serviced principally from the operations of the business and those operations may not be successful historical trends have shown these types of loans to have higher delinquencies than mortgage loans as a result of these additional complexities variables and risks commercial loans require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans included in commercial loans are commitments to oil and gas producers largely secured by proven developed and producing reserves and commitments to service equipment and midstream companies secured mainly by accounts receivable inventory and equipment mineral reserve values supporting commitments to producers are normally redetermined semiannually using reserve studies prepared by a thirdparty or the companys oil and gas engineer accounts receivable and inventory borrowing bases for service companies are typically redetermined monthly funding requests by both producers and service companies are monitored relative to the most recently determined borrowing base as of december the company had million net of discount and excluding ppp loans totaling million in funded commitments outstanding to oil and gas production companies and million in unfunded commitments for a total of million net of discount and excluding ppp loans this compares with funded commitments to oil and gas production companies of million and million in unfunded commitments for a total of million as of december total unfunded commitments to producers include letters of credit issued in lieu of oil well plugging bonds as of december the company had million net of discount and excluding ppp loans totaling million in funded commitments outstanding to service companies and million in unfunded commitments for a total of million net of discount and excluding ppp loans this compares with funded commitments to service companies of million and million in unfunded commitments for a total of million as of december commercial real estate the company makes commercial real estate loans collateralized by owneroccupied and nonowneroccupied real estate to finance the purchase of real estate the companys commercial real estate loans are collateralized by first liens on real estate typically have variable interest rates or five year or less fixed rates and amortize over a to 25year period payments on loans secured by nonowneroccupied properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties accordingly repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than other types of loans the company seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways including giving careful consideration to the propertys operating history future operating projections current and projected occupancy location and physical condition in connection with underwriting these loans the underwriting analysis also includes credit verification analysis of global cash flow appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower and guarantor loans to hotels and restaurants are primarily included in commercial real estate loans as of december loans to hotels totaled million excluding ppp loans totaling million or of total loans and loans to restaurants totaled million excluding ppp loans totaling million or of total loans family residential loans the companys lending activities also include the origination of family residential mortgage loans including home equity loans collateralized by owneroccupied and nonowneroccupied residential properties located in the companys market areas the company offers a variety of mortgage loan portfolio products which generally are amortized over five to years loans collateralized by family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than of appraised value the company requires mortgage title insurance as well as hazard wind andor flood insurance as appropriate the company prefers to retain residential mortgage loans for its own account rather than selling them into the secondary market by doing so the company incurs interest rate risk as well as the risks associated with nonpayments on such loans the companys mortgage department also offers a variety of mortgage loan products which are generally amortized over years including fha and va loans which are sold to secondary market investors construction land development and other land loans the company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and nonresidential properties construction loans generally are collateralized by first liens on real estate and have floating interest rates the company conducts periodic inspections either directly or through an agent prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in the companys construction lending activities with heightened analysis of construction andor development costs construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio as a result of these uncertainties construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent in part on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan if the company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion the company may not be able to recover all of the unpaid portion of the loan in addition the company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time although the company has underwriting procedures designed to identify what it believes to be acceptable levels of risks in construction lending these procedures may not prevent losses from the risks described above warehouse purchase program the company acquired the warehouse purchase program as part of the merger the warehouse purchase program allows unaffiliated mortgage originators clients to close family real estate loans in their own name and manage their cash flow needs until the loans are sold to investors the companys clients are strategically targeted for their experienced management teams and analyzed for the expected profitability of each clients business model over the long term the clients are located across the us and originate mortgage loans primarily through traditional retail andor wholesale business models using underwriting standards as required by united states governmentsponsored enterprise agencies such as fannie mae private investors to which the mortgage loans are ultimately sold and or mortgage insurers at december the company had mortgage banking company customers with aggregate uncommitted facilities facilities of billion and an actual aggregate outstanding balance of billion and the clients individual facilities ranged in size from million to million a facility is often supported by a payment guaranty of the clients owners holding significant ownership positions along with noninterestbearing compensating balance deposits in line with the facility amount typical covenants include minimum tangible net worth maximum leverage and minimum liquidity as loans age the company requires loan curtailments to reduce the companys risk if an individual mortgage loan is not timely purchased by an investor the average mortgage loan being purchased by the company reflects a blend of agency and private investor underwriting guidelines at december the companys mortgage warehouse portfolio had an average loantovalue ratio ltv of an average credit score of and an average loan size of the companys purchases under these facilities are priced using a combined base rate and a risk premium set for both product type prime jumbo etc and age of the loan although not subject to any legally binding commitment when the company makes a purchase decision it acquires a participation interest in the mortgage loans originated by its clients individual mortgage loans are warehoused in the companys portfolio only for a short duration averaging less than days when instructed by a client that a warehoused loan has been sold to an investor the company delivers the note to the investor that pays the company which in turn remits the net sales proceeds to the client agriculture loans the company provides agriculture loans for shortterm livestock and crop production including rice cotton milo and corn farm equipment financing and agriculture real estate financing the company evaluates agriculture borrowers primarily based on their historical profitability level of experience in their particular industry segment overall financial capacity and the availability of secondary collateral to withstand economic and natural variations common to the industry because agriculture loans present a higher level of risk associated with events caused by nature the company routinely makes onsite visits and inspections in order to identify and monitor such risks consumer loans consumer loans made by the company include direct acredit automobile loans recreational vehicle loans boat loans home improvement loans personal loans collateralized and uncollateralized and deposit account collateralized loans the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan generally consumer loans entail greater risk than do real estate secured loans particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or collateralized by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles in such cases any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment in addition consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss divorce illness personal bankruptcy or death furthermore the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans loan maturities the contractual maturity ranges of the companys loan portfolio by type of loan and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of december are summarized in the following table contractual maturities are based on contractual amounts outstanding and do not include loan purchase discounts of million loans held for sale of million or warehouse purchase program loans of billion at december table start one year or less after one year through five

nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status accruing loans days or more past due repossessed assets and real estate which has been acquired through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition nonperforming assets do not include pcd loans unless the loan has deteriorated since the acquisition date pcd loans are reported as nonperforming assets when a deterioration in projected cash flows is identified the company has several procedures in place to assist it in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio the company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers and the company also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends nevertheless the companys loan portfolio could become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions as part of the ongoing monitoring of the companys loan portfolio and the methodology for calculating the allowance for credit losses management grades each loan from to for certain loans in risk grades to a specific reserve may be required when calculating the allowance for credit losses the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when the payment of principal or interest is delinquent for days or earlier in some cases unless the loan is in the process of collection and the underlying collateral fully supports the carrying value of the loan a loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured which is typically evidenced by a sustained period at least six months of repayment performance by the borrower with respect to potential problem loans an evaluation of the borrowers overall financial condition is made together with an appraisal for loans collateralized by real estate to determine the need if any for possible writedowns or appropriate additions to the allowance for credit losses the following table presents information regarding past due loans and nonperforming assets at the dates indicated

remaining fair value marks in addition all loans previously accounted for under asc had their credit marks reclassified to be included in the allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is adjusted through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate as of december for estimated losses in the companys loan portfolio the amount of the allowance for credit losses is affected by the following chargeoffs of loans that occur when loans are deemed uncollectible and decrease the allowance recoveries on loans previously charged off that increase the allowance and provisions for credit losses charged to earnings that increase the allowance or provision releases returned to earnings that decrease the allowance based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio and consideration of the factors listed below management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the banks board of directors indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for credit losses future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions or the borrowers performance differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations the companys allowance for credit losses consists of two components a specific valuation allowance based on expected lifetime losses on specifically identified loans and a general valuation allowance based on historical lifetime loan loss experience current economic conditions reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company in setting the specific valuation allowance the company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to each loan through this loan review process the company maintains an internal list of impaired loans which along with the delinquency list of loans helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses all loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required for certain impaired loans the company allocates a specific loan loss reserve primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the impaired loan the specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the general valuation allowance described below in connection with this review of the loan portfolio the company considers risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans some of the risk elements include table start for family residential mortgage loans the borrowers ability to repay the loan including a consideration of the debt to income ratio and employment and income stability the loan to value ratio and the age condition and marketability of collateral table end table start for commercial mortgage loans and multifamily residential loans the debt service coverage ratio income from the property in excess of operating expenses compared to loan payment requirements operating results of the owner in the case of owneroccupied properties the loan to value ratio the age and

quality and nature of contracts for presale or prelease if any experience and ability of the developer and loan to value ratio table end table start for commercial and industrial loans the operating results of the commercial industrial or professional enterprise the borrowers business professional and financial ability and expertise the specific risks and volatility of income and operating

start for nonreal estate agriculture loans the operating results experience and financial capability of the borrower historical and expected market conditions and the value nature and marketability of collateral table end in addition for each category the company considers secondary sources of income and the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and any guarantors in determining the amount of the general valuation allowance management considers factors such as historical lifetime loan loss experience concentration risk of specific loan types the volume growth and composition of the companys loan portfolio current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay and the value of collateral the evaluation of the companys loan portfolio through its internal loan review process general economic conditions other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company and other relevant factors historical lifetime loan loss experience is determined by utilizing an openpool cumulative loss rate methodology adjustments to the historical lifetime loan loss experience are made for differences in current loan pool risk characteristics such as portfolio concentrations delinquency nonaccrual and watch list levels as well as changes in current and forecasted economic conditions such as unemployment rates property and collateral values and other indices relating to economic activity the utilization of reasonable and supportable forecasts includes an immediate reversion to lifetime historical loss rates based on a review of these factors for each loan type the company applies an estimated percentage to the outstanding balance of each loan type excluding any loan that has a specific reserve allocated to it the company uses this information to establish the amount of the general valuation allowance a change in the allowance for credit losses can be attributable to several factors most notably specific reserves identified for impaired loans historical lifetime credit loss information changes in current and forecasted environmental factors and growth in the balance of loans changes in the companys asset quality are reflected in the allowance in several ways specific reserves that are calculated on a loanbyloan basis and the qualitative assessment of all other loans reflect current changes in the credit quality of the loan portfolio historical lifetime credit losses on the other hand are based on an openpool cumulative loss rate methodology which is then applied to estimate lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio a deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio in the current period would increase the historical lifetime loss rate to be applied in future periods just as an improvement in credit quality would decrease the historical lifetime loss rate the allowance for credit losses is further determined by the size of the loan portfolio subject to the allowance methodology and environmental factors that include companyspecific risk indicators and general economic conditions both of which are constantly changing the company evaluates the economic and portfoliospecific factors on a quarterly basis to determine a qualitative component of the general valuation allowance the factors include current economic metrics reasonable and supportable forecasted economic metrics business conditions delinquency trends credit concentrations nature and volume of the portfolio and other adjustments for items not covered by specific reserves and historical lifetime loss experience managements assessment of qualitative factors is a statistically based approach to determine the loss rate adjustment associated with such factors based on the companys actual historical lifetime loan loss experience relative to economic and loan portfoliospecific factors at the time the losses occurred management is able to identify the probable level of lifetime losses as of the date of measurement the correlation of historical loss experience with current and forecasted economic conditions provides an estimate of lifetime losses that has not been previously factored into the general valuation allowance by the determination of specific reserves and lifetime historical losses additionally the company considers qualitative factors not easily quantified and the possibility of model imprecision utilizing the aggregation of specific reserves historical loss experience and a qualitative component management is able to determine the valuation allowance to reflect the full lifetime loss the company accounts for its acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting accordingly the assets including loans and liabilities of the acquired entity were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date these fair value estimates associated with acquired loans and based on a discounted cash flow model include estimates related to market interest rates and undiscounted projections of future cash flows that incorporate expectations of prepayments and the amount and timing of principal interest and other cash flows as well as any shortfalls thereof nonpcd loans that were not deemed impaired subsequent to the acquisition date are considered nonimpaired and are evaluated as part of the general valuation allowance nonpcd loans that have become impaired subsequent to acquisition are assessed for the specific valuation allowance nonpcd loans that have deteriorated to an impaired status subsequent to acquisition are evaluated for a specific reserve on a quarterly basis which when identified is added to the allowance for credit losses the company reviews impaired nonpcd loans on a loanbyloan basis and determines the specific reserve based on the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and one of three factors expected future cash flows observable market price or fair value of the collateral because essentially all of the companys impaired nonpcd loans have been collateraldependent the amount of the specific reserve historically has been determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral securing the nonpcd loan with the recorded investment in such loan in the future the company will continue to analyze impaired nonpcd loans on a loanbyloan basis and may use an alternative measurement method to determine the specific reserve as appropriate and in accordance with applicable accounting standards pcd loans are individually monitored on a quarterly basis to assess for changes in expected cash flows subsequent to acquisition if a deterioration in cash flows is identified an additional provision for credit losses is made pcd loans were recorded at their acquisition date fair values which were based on expected cash flows and included estimates of expected future credit losses the companys estimates of loan fair values at the acquisition date may be adjusted for a period of up to one year as the company continues to evaluate its estimate of expected future cash flows at the acquisition date if the company determines that losses arose after the acquisition date the additional losses will be reflected as a provision for credit losses see critical accounting policies above for more information as described in the section captioned critical accounting policies above the companys determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of judgment and complexity the companys analysis of qualitative or environmental factors on pools of loans with common risk characteristics in combination with the quantitative historical lifetime loss information and specific reserves provides the company with an estimate of lifetime losses the allowance must reflect changes in the balance of loans subject to the allowance methodology as well as the estimated lifetime losses associated with those loans in the companys case the million increase in the allowance for credit losses for the year ended december was primarily due to million related to the companys adoption of cecl the increase in allowance for credit losses was additionally driven by the anticipated impact of the covid19 pandemic elevated unemployment levels and other internal and external environment factors which resulted in a provision for credit losses of million for the year ended december net chargeoffs were million for the year ended december net chargeoffs for the year ended december included million related to resolved pcd

its amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss the expected credit losses will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investments amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date if an entity does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the entity will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any currentperiod loss the expected credit losses will be separated into the amount representing the creditrelated portion of the impairment loss credit loss and the noncredit portion of the impairment loss noncredit portion the amount of the total expected credit losses related to the credit loss is determined based on the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis and such difference is recognized in earnings the amount of the total expected credit losses related to the noncredit portion is recognized in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes the previous amortized cost basis less the expected credit losses recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment as of december management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale before a recovery of cost in addition management believes it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell any of its investment securities before a recovery of cost the unrealized losses are largely due to changes in market interest rates and spread relationships since the time the underlying securities were purchased the fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality accordingly as of december management believes that there is no potential for credit losses on available for sale securities held to maturity securities the companys held to maturity investments include mortgagerelated bonds issued by either the government national mortgage corporation ginnie mae federal national mortgage association fannie mae or federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac ginnie mae issued securities are explicitly guaranteed by the us government while fannie mae and freddie mac issued securities are fully guaranteed by those respective united states governmentsponsored agencies and conditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the united states the companys held to maturity securities also include taxable and taxexempt municipal securities issued primarily by school districts utility districts and municipalities located in texas the companys investment in municipal securities is exposed to credit risk the securities are highly rated by major rating agencies and regularly reviewed by management a significant portion are guaranteed or insured by either the texas permanent school fund assured guaranty or build america mutual as of december the companys municipal securities represent of the securities portfolio management has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held to maturity until they mature at which time the company will receive full value for the securities accordingly as of december management believes that there is no potential for material credit losses on held to maturity securities the following table summarizes the contractual maturity of securities and their weighted average yields as of december the contractual maturity of a mortgagebacked security is the date at which the last underlying mortgage matures the weighted average life of the companys securities portfolio is years with a modified duration of at december available for sale securities are shown at fair value and held to maturity securities are shown at amortized cost for purposes of

within ten years after ten years total amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield total yield dollars in thousands states and political subdivisions collateralized mortgage obligations mortgagebacked securities total table end the contractual maturity of mortgagebacked securities and collateralized mortgage obligations is not a reliable indicator of their expected life because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time mortgagebacked securities monthly pay downs cause the average lives of the securities to be much different than their stated lives during a period of increasing interest rates fixed rate mortgagebacked securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently the average life of this security will be lengthened if interest rates begin to fall prepayments may increase thereby shortening the estimated life of this security at december and the company did not own securities of any one issuer other than the us government and its agencies for which aggregate adjusted cost exceeded of the consolidated shareholders equity at such respective dates the average tax equivalent yield of the securities portfolio was as of december compared with and as of december and respectively this decrease was primarily due to the investment in lower yielding securities and higher prepayments the average tax equivalent yield on the securities portfolio was based on a tax rate in and the average yield excluding the tax equivalent adjustment was for the year ended december compared with for the year ended december and for the year ended december the change in the average balance in the securities portfolio over the comparable periods was primarily due to maturities and prepayments of securities during the year ended december mortgagebacked securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and which are principally issued by federal agencies such as government national mortgage association ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest are guaranteed by the issuing agencies unlike us treasury and us government agency securities which have a lump sum payment at maturity mortgagebacked securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities premiums and discounts on mortgagebacked securities are amortized over the expected life of the security and may be impacted by prepayments as such mortgagebacked securities which are purchased at a premium will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because homeowners tend to refinance their mortgages resulting in prepayments and an acceleration of premium amortization securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment as prepayments result in an acceleration of discount accretion at december of the mortgagebacked securities held by the company had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a weighted average life of years collateralized mortgage obligations cmos are bonds that are backed by pools of mortgages the pools can be ginnie mae fannie mae or freddie mac pools or they can be privatelabel pools cmos are designed so that the mortgage collateral will generate a cash flow sufficient to provide for the timely repayment of the bonds so long as the collateral cash flow is adequate to meet scheduled bond payments the mortgage collateral pool can be structured to accommodate various desired bond repayment schedules this is accomplished by dividing the bonds into classes to which payments on the underlying mortgage pools are allocated in different order the bonds cash flow for example can be dedicated to one class of bondholders at a time thereby increasing call protection to bondholders in privatelabel cmos losses on underlying mortgages are directed to the most junior of all classes and then to the classes above in order of increasing seniority which means that the senior classes have enough credit protection to be given the highest credit rating by the rating agencies deposits the companys lending and investing activities are primarily funded by

company assumed million in junior subordinated debentures which were redeemed in december accordingly as of december and the company had no junior subordinated debentures outstanding interest rate sensitivity and market risk the companys asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the guidelines for effective funds management and the company has established a measurement system for monitoring its net interest rate sensitivity position the company manages its sensitivity position within established guidelines as a financial institution the companys primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility fluctuations in interest rates ultimately will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the companys assets and liabilities and the market value of all interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities other than those which have a short term to maturity interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income a loss of current fair market values or both the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while maximizing income the company primarily manages its exposure to interest rates by structuring its balance sheet in the ordinary course of business the company does not employ material amounts of instruments such as leveraged derivatives interest rate swaps financial options financial future contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk based upon the nature of the companys operations with the exception of how commodity prices may impact the companys borrowers ability to repay loans the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk the company is not involved in trading assets for its own account the companys exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability committee alco which consists of senior officers of the company in accordance with policies approved by the companys board of directors the alco formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk the alco considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates potential changes in interest rates regional economies liquidity business strategies and other factors the alco meets regularly to review among other things the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes the book and market values of assets and liabilities unrealized gains and losses purchase and sale activities commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings additionally the alco reviews liquidity cash flow flexibility maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk an analysis of relationships between interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and an interest rate shock simulation model the company has traditionally managed its business to reduce its overall exposure to changes in interest rates the company uses an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as are prepayment assumptions maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for nonmaturity deposit accounts the assumptions used are inherently uncertain and as a result the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income actual results will differ from the models simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies the company utilizes static balance sheet rate shocks to estimate the potential impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various rate scenarios this analysis estimates a percentage of change in the metric from the stable rate base scenario versus alternative scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates by instantaneously shocking a static balance sheet the following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income at the 12month horizon considering the balance sheet composition as of december table start change in interest percent change in rates basis points net interest income base table end the results are significantly influenced by the behavior of demand money market and savings deposits and the overall balance sheet composition during such rate fluctuations the company has found that historically interest rates on these deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and federal funds rates this assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis the assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain and as a result the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income actual results will differ from the models simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies liquidity liquidity involves the companys ability to raise funds to support asset growth and acquisitions or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the company on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events during and the companys liquidity needs have primarily been met by core deposits security and loan maturities amortizing investment and loan portfolios and advances from the fhlb of dallas although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities the company does not generally rely on this external funding source the following table illustrates during the years presented the mix of the companys funding sources and the average assets in which those funds are

the companys largest source of funds is deposits and its principal uses of funds are securities and loans the company does not expect a change in the source or use of its funds in the foreseeable future the companys average deposits increased for the year ended december compared with the year ended december which was primarily due to the merger the companys average loans increased for the year ended december compared with the year ended december which was primarily due to the merger the company predominantly invests excess deposits in governmentbacked securities until the funds are needed

the company announced a stock repurchase program under which the company could repurchase up to or approximately million shares of its outstanding common stock over a oneyear period expiring on january at the discretion of management under the stock repurchase program the company may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices through openmarket purchases or privately negotiated transactions depending upon market conditions repurchases under this program may also be made in transactions outside the safe harbor during a pending merger acquisition or similar transaction the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price corporate and regulatory requirements market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities shares of stock repurchased are held as authorized but unissued shares the company is not obligated to purchase any particular number of shares and the company may suspend modify or terminate the program at any time and for any reason without prior notice offbalance sheet items in the normal course of business the company enters into various transactions that in accordance with gaap are not included in its consolidated balance sheets the company enters into these transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers these transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit which involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets the companys commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit unused capacity on warehouse purchase program loans and commitments to extend credit expiring by period as of december are summarized below since commitments associated with letters of credit unused capacity of warehouse purchase program loans and commitments to extend credit may expire unused the amounts shown do not

standby letters of credit unused capacity on warehouse purchase program loans commitments to extend credit total table end standby letters of credit standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the payment by or performance of a customer to a third party if the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party the company would be required to fund the commitment the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment if the commitment is funded the company would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer the companys policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements unused capacity on warehouse purchase program loans for warehouse purchase program loans the company has established a maximum purchase facility amount but reserves the right at any time to refuse to buy any mortgage loans offered for sale by its mortgage banking company customers for any reason commitments to extend credit the company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses at specified rates and for specific purposes substantially all of the companys commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding the company minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for credit losses allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures the company funds an allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet lendingrelated commitments and guarantees on credit card debt through a charge to provision for credit losses on the companys consolidated statement of income at december and this allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet lendingrelated commitments and guarantees on credit card debt included in allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures on the companys consolidated balance sheet totaled million and million respectively capital resources capital management consists of providing equity to support the companys current and future operations the company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve board and the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the fdic both the federal reserve board and the fdic have adopted riskbased capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy these standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and offbalance sheet exposure adjusted for credit risk in july the federal reserve board and the fdic published the basel iii capital rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the basel iii capital rules among other things introduced a new capital measure called common equity tier cet1 specified that tier capital consists of cet1 and additional tier capital instruments meeting specified requirements defined cet1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital and expanded the scope of the deductions adjustments as compared to existing regulations the basel iii capital rules require a capital conservation buffer composed entirely of cet1 in addition to the minimum riskweighted asset capital ratios the implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on january at the level and was phased in over a fouryear period increasing by that amount on each subsequent january until it reached on january since being fully phased in on january the basel iii capital rules require the company to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer composed entirely of cet1 of effectively resulting in minimum ratios of cet1 to riskweighted assets of tier capital to riskweighted assets of total capital that is tier plus tier to riskweighted assets of and tier capital to average quarterly assets as reported on consolidated financial statements known as the leverage ratio of the bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the fdic that are substantially similar to the federal reserve boards guidelines also pursuant to fdicia the fdic has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as the bank would be considered wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized under the fdics regulations the bank is classified wellcapitalized for purposes of prompt corrective action banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income that is fourquarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income in response to the covid19 pandemic in march the joint federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that allows banking organizations that implement cecl in to mitigate the effects of the cecl accounting standard in their regulatory capital for two years this twoyear delay is in addition to the threeyear transition period that the agencies had already made available the company has elected to adopt the option provided by the interim final rule which will largely delay the effects of cecl on its regulatory capital for the next two years after which the effects will be phasedin over a threeyear period from january through december under the interim final rule the amount of adjustments to regulatory capital deferred until the phasein period include both the initial impact of the companys adoption of cecl at january and of subsequent changes in the companys allowance for credit losses during each quarter of the twoyear period ending december as of december the companys ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets was tier capital to riskweighted assets was total capital to riskweighted assets was and tier capital to average quarterly assets was it is important to note that warehouse purchase program loan volumes can increase significantly on the last day of the month potentially leading to a significant difference between the ending and average balance of warehouse purchase program loans for a given period at december warehouse purchase program loans totaled billion compared to an average balance of b illion because the capital ratios above are calculated using ending riskweighted assets and warehouse purchase program loans are ri skweighted at the endof period increase in these balances can significantly impact the companys reported capital ratios total shareholders equity increased to billion at december compared with billion at december an increase of million or
