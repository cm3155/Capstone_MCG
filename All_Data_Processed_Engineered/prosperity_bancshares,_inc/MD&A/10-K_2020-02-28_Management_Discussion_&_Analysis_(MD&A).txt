analyzes the major elements of the companys balance sheets and statements of income this section should be read in conjunction with the companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k overview the company generates the majority of its revenues from interest income on loans service charges and fees on customer accounts and income from investment in securities the company also earns revenues from various additional products and services it provides including trust services mortgage lending brokerage credit card and independent sales organization sponsorship operations the companys revenues are partially offset by interest expense paid on deposits and other borrowings and noninterest expenses such as administrative and occupancy expenses net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings which are used to fund those assets net interest income is the companys largest source of revenue the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities impact net interest income and margin three principal components of the companys growth strategy are internal growth efficient operations and acquisitions including strategic merger transactions the company focuses on continual internal growth each banking center is operated as a separate profit center maintaining separate data with respect to its net interest income efficiency ratio deposit growth loan growth and overall profitability the company also focuses on maintaining efficiency and stringent cost control practices and policies the company has centralized many of its critical operations such as data processing and loan and deposit processing management believes that this centralized infrastructure can accommodate substantial additional growth while enabling the company to minimize operational costs through certain economies of scale the company also intends to continue to seek expansion opportunities net income was million million and million for the years ended december and respectively and diluted earnings per share were and respectively for these same periods the change in net income during was principally due to an increase in interest income partially offset by an increase in interest expense and merger related expenses of million the change in net income during was principally due to lower corporate tax rates and an increase in interest income partially offset by an increase in interest expense the company posted returns on average assets of and and returns on average common equity of and for the years ended december and respectively the companys efficiency ratio was in in and in the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense excluding credit loss provisions by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income because the ratio is a measure of revenues and expenses resulting from the companys lending activities and feebased banking services net gains and losses on the sale of assets and securities are not included additionally taxes are not part of this calculation total assets at december and were billion and billion respectively total deposits were billion at december an increase of billion or compared with billion at december total loans were billion at december an increase of billion or compared with billion at december at december the company had million in nonperforming loans and its allowance for credit losses was million compared with million in nonperforming loans and an allowance for credit losses of million at december shareholders equity was billion and billion at december and respectively recent acquisition merger with legacytexas financial group inc on november legacytexas financial group inc legacytexas merged with prosperity bancshares and legacytexas bank merged with prosperity bank collectively the merger legacytexas was headquartered in plano texas and operated locations in north texas cities in and around the dallasfort worth area as of september legacytexas on a consolidated basis reported total assets of billion total gross loans of billion total deposits of billion and shareholders equity of billion pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement prosperity issued  of prosperity common stock with a closing price of per share plus million in cash made up of million in cash and million cash in taxes withheld for all outstanding shares of legacytexas this resulted in goodwill of billion as of december additionally prosperity recognized million of core deposit intangibles as of december the goodwill balance as of december does not include all subsequent fair value adjustments that are still being finalized critical accounting policies the companys significant accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported the companys accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere is this annual report on form 10k the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity business combinations generally acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc business combinations a business combination occurs when the company acquires net assets that constitute a business and obtains control over that business business combinations are effected through the transfer of consideration consisting of cash andor common stock and are accounted for using the acquisition method accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date determining the fair value of assets and liabilities especially the loan portfolio is a process involving significant judgment regarding methods and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair values fair values are subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as information relative to closing date fair values becomes available the results of operations of an acquired entity are included in the companys consolidated results from acquisition date and prior periods are not restated the fair value of acquired loans incorporates assumptions regarding future credit losses and therefore no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses the companys allowance for credit losses consists of two elements specific valuation allowances based on probable losses on impaired loans and a general valuation allowance based on historical loan loss experience general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company management has established an allowance for credit losses which it believes is adequate for estimated losses in the companys loan portfolio based on an evaluation of the portfolio management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the banks board of directors indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance in making its evaluation management considers factors such as historical loan loss experience the amount of nonperforming assets and related collateral the volume growth and composition of the portfolio current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay and the value of collateral the evaluation of the portfolio through its internal loan review process and other relevant factors portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits however the entire allowance is available for any credit that in managements judgment should be charged off chargeoffs occur when loans are deemed to be uncollectible for further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses see accounting for acquired loans and the allowance for acquired credit losses financial conditionallowance for credit losses sections below and note to the consolidated financial statements accounting for acquired loans and the allowance for acquired credit losses the company accounts for its acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting accordingly the assets including loans and liabilities of the acquired entity were recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date no allowance for credit losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date as the fair value of the acquired loans incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk these fair value estimates associated with acquired loans and based on a discounted cash flow model include estimates related to market interest rates and undiscounted projections of future cash flows that incorporate expectations of prepayments and the amount and timing of principal interest and other cash flows as well as any shortfalls thereof at periodend after acquisition the fairvalued acquired loans from each acquisition are reassessed to determine whether an addition to the allowance for credit losses is appropriate due to further credit quality deterioration for further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses for acquired loans see financial conditionallowance for credit losses below for further discussion of the companys acquisition and loan accounting see note to the consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the companys reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity under accounting standards codification asc topic intangiblesgoodwill and othergoodwill companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining the need to perform step one of the annual test for goodwill impairment an entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment described in the following paragraph for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period the company currently utilizes a qualitative assessment for its annual goodwill impairment analysis if the company bypasses the qualitative assessment a twostep goodwill impairment test is performed the twostep process begins with an estimation of the fair value of the companys reporting unit compared with its carrying value if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit a second test is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment the company had no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at december core deposit intangible assets that are subject to amortization are being amortized on a nonpro rata basis over the years expected to be benefited which the company believes is between ten and fifteen years these core deposit intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value to carrying value based on the companys annual goodwill impairment test as of september management does not believe any of its goodwill is impaired as of december because the fair value of the companys equity exceeded its carrying value while the company believes no impairment existed at december under accounting standards applicable at that date different conditions or assumptions or changes in cash flows or profitability if significantly negative or unfavorable could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the companys impairment evaluation and financial condition or future results of operations otherthantemporarily impaired securities when the fair value of a security is below its amortized cost and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair market value is below amortized cost additional analysis is performed to determine whether an otherthantemporary impairment exists available for sale and held to maturity securities are analyzed quarterly for possible otherthantemporary impairment the analysis considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions and whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery often the information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing making estimates of fair value subject to judgment if actual information or conditions are different than estimated the extent of the impairment of the security may be different than previously estimated which could have a material effect on the companys results of operations and financial condition fair values of financial instruments the company determines the fair market values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value there are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level inputs include quoted active market prices where available if such quoted market prices are not available level inputs are used these inputs are based upon internally developed analytical tools that primarily use observable marketbased parameters level inputs are unobservable inputs which are typically based on an entitys own assumptions as there is little if any related market activity the companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability tax cuts and jobs act the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted on december and made widespread changes to the us tax code effective january under asc topic income taxes the company was required to recalculate its deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates and lost deductions on these assets and liabilities the recalculation resulted in a onetime noncash charge of million recorded to income tax expense for the year ended december results of operations net interest income the companys operating results depend primarily on its net interest income which is the difference between interest income on interestearning assets including securities and loans and interest expense incurred on interestbearing liabilities including deposits and other borrowed funds interest rate fluctuations as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities combine to affect net interest income the companys net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities referred to as a volume change it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing deposits and other borrowed funds referred to as a rate change versus net interest income before the provision for credit losses for was million compared with

related expenses merger related expenses were million for the year ended december related to the merger that was completed on november efficiency ratio the companys efficiency ratio is a supplemental financial measure utilized in managements internal evaluation of the company and is not calculated based on gaap a gaapbased efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense excluding credit loss provisions by net interest income plus total noninterest income as shown in the consolidated statements of income the companys efficiency ratio as calculated and used by the company excludes from noninterest income the net gains and losses on the sale of securities and assets which can vary widely from period to period taxes are not included in either calculation an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources the companys efficiency ratio calculated pursuant to gaap was for the year ended december compared with for the year ended december and for the year ended december the efficiency ratio excluding net gains and losses on the sale of securities and assets was for the year ended december compared with for the year ended december and for the year ended december income taxes the amount of federal and state

months of operations related to the legacytexas banking centers and lending function income tax expense was million for the year ended december a decrease of million or compared with million for the year ended december the decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in corporate tax rates by the tax cuts and jobs act the effective tax rate for the years ended december and was and

the companys consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form 10k have been prepared in accordance with gaap these require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession unlike many industrial companies substantially all of the companys assets and liabilities are monetary in nature as a result interest rates have a more significant impact on the companys performance than the effects of general levels of inflation interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services however noninterest expenses do reflect general levels of inflation financial condition loan portfolio at december total loans were billion an increase of billion or compared with billion at december loans at december included million of loans held for sale

effect at the time the loan was made are ref erred to as originated loans and acquired loans which are loans acquired in a business combination those acquired loans that are renewed or substantially modified after the date of the business combination thereby subjecting them to the companys allowance for credit losses methodology are referred to as reunderwritten acquired loans if a renewal or substantial modification of an acquired loan is underwritten by the company with a new credit analysis the loan may no longer be categorized as an acquired loan for example acquired loans to one borrower may be combined into a new loan with a new loan nu mber and categorized as an originated loan acquired loans with a fair value discount or premium at the date of the business combination that remained at the reporting date are referred to as fairvalued acquired loans all fairvalued acquired loans are further categorized into nonpci loans an d pci loans purchased credit impaired loans acquired loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration at acquisition for which it is probable that the company would not be able to collect all contractual amounts due are pci loans the following tables summarize the companys originated and acquired loan portfolios broken out into originated loans reunderwritten acquired loans nonpci loans and pci loans as of the dates indicated

commercial loans primarily collateralized to businesses for working capital including inventory and receivables business expansion including acquisitions of real estate and improvements and the purchase of equipment and machinery historically the company has originated loans for its own account including loans in the family residential category and has not securitized its loans however the company does originate longerterm residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market the purpose of a particular loan generally determines its structure loans to borrowers with aggregate debt relationships over million and below million are evaluated and acted upon on a daily basis by two of the companywide loan concurrence officers loans to borrowers with aggregate debt relationships above million are evaluated and acted upon by an officers loan committee that meets weekly commercial and industrial loans in nearly all cases the companys commercial loans are made in the companys market areas and are underwritten on the basis of the borrowers ability to service the debt from income working capital loans are primarily collateralized by shortterm assets whereas term loans are primarily collateralized by longterm assets as a general practice term loans are secured by any available real estate equipment or other assets owned by the borrower both working capital and term loans are typically supported by a personal guaranty of a principal in general commercial loans involve more credit risk than residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans and therefore usually yield a higher return the increased risk in commercial loans is due to the type of collateral securing these loans as well as the expectation that commercial loans generally will be serviced principally from the operations of the business and those operations may not be successful historical trends have shown these types of loans to have higher delinquencies than mortgage loans as a result of these additional complexities variables and risks commercial loans require more thorough underwriting and servicing than other types of loans included in commercial loans are commitments to oil and gas producers largely secured by proven developed and producing reserves and commitments to service equipment and midstream companies secured mainly by accounts receivable inventory and equipment mineral reserve values supporting commitments to producers are normally redetermined semiannually using reserve studies prepared by a thirdparty or the companys oil and gas engineer accounts receivable and inventory borrowing bases for service companies are typically redetermined monthly funding requests by both producers and service companies are monitored relative to the most recently determined borrowing base as of december the company had million in funded commitments outstanding to oil and gas production companies and million in unfunded commitments for a total of million this compares with funded commitments to oil and gas production companies of million and million in unfunded commitments for a total of million as of december total unfunded commitments to producers include letters of credit issued in lieu of oil well plugging bonds as of december the company had outstanding million in funded commitments to service companies and million in unfunded commitments for a total of million this compares with funded commitments to service companies of million and million in unfunded commitments for a total of million as of december commercial real estate the company makes commercial real estate loans collateralized by owneroccupied and nonowneroccupied real estate to finance the purchase of real estate the companys commercial real estate loans are collateralized by first liens on real estate typically have variable interest rates or five year or less fixed rates and amortize over a to 25year period payments on loans secured by nonowneroccupied properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties accordingly repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy to a greater extent than other types of loans the company seeks to minimize these risks in a variety of ways including giving careful consideration to the propertys operating history future operating projections current and projected occupancy location and physical condition in connection with underwriting these loans the underwriting analysis also includes credit verification analysis of global cash flow appraisals and a review of the financial condition of the borrower and guarantor family residential loans the companys lending activities also include the origination of family residential mortgage loans including home equity loans collateralized by owneroccupied and nonowneroccupied residential properties located in the companys market areas the company offers a variety of mortgage loan portfolio products which generally are amortized over five to years loans collateralized by family residential real estate generally have been originated in amounts of no more than of appraised value the company requires mortgage title insurance as well as hazard wind andor flood insurance as appropriate the company prefers to retain residential mortgage loans for its own account rather than selling them into the secondary market by doing so the company incurs interest rate risk as well as the risks associated with nonpayments on such loans the companys mortgage department also offers a variety of mortgage loan products which are generally amortized over years including fha and va loans which are sold to secondary market investors construction land development and other land loans the company makes loans to finance the construction of residential and nonresidential properties construction loans generally are collateralized by first liens on real estate and have floating interest rates the company conducts periodic inspections either directly or through an agent prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans underwriting guidelines similar to those described above are also used in the companys construction lending activities with heightened analysis of construction andor development costs construction loans involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of a project under construction and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion because of uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property it can be difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio as a result of these uncertainties construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent in part on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan if the company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion the company may not be able to recover all of the unpaid portion of the loan in addition the company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time although the company has underwriting procedures designed to identify what it believes to be acceptable levels of risks in construction lending these procedures may not prevent losses from the risks described above warehouse purchase program the company acquired the warehouse purchase program as part of the merger with legacytexas the warehouse purchase program allows unaffiliated mortgage originators clients to close family real estate loans in their own name and manage their cash flow needs until the loans are sold to investors the companys clients are strategically targeted for their experienced management teams and analyzed for the expected profitability of each clients business model over the long term the clients located across the us and originate mortgage loans primarily through traditional retail andor wholesale business models and use underwriting standards consistent with the united states governmentsponsored enterprises agencies such as fannie mae the private investors to which the mortgage loans are ultimately sold and the mortgage insurers at december the bank had mortgage banking company customers with aggregate uncommitted facilities facilities of billion and an actual aggregate outstanding balance of billion and the clients individual facilities ranged in size from million to million a facility is often supported by a payment guaranty of the clients owners holding significant ownership positions along with noninterestbearing compensating balance deposits in line with the facility amount typical covenants include minimum tangible net worth maximum leverage and minimum liquidity as loans age the company requires loan curtailments to reduce the companys risk if an individual mortgage loan is not timely purchased by an investor the average mortgage loan being purchased by the company reflects a blend of agency and private investor underwriting guidelines at december the companys mortgage warehouse portfolio had an average loantovalue ratio ltv of an average credit score of and an average loan size of the companys purchases under these facilities are priced using a combined base rate and a risk premium set for both product type prime jumbo etc and age of the loan although not subject to any legally binding commitments when the company makes a purchase decision it acquires a participation interest in the mortgage loans originated by its clients individual mortgage loans are warehoused in the companys portfolio only for a short duration usually averaging less than days when instructed by a client that a warehoused loan has been sold to an investor the company delivers the note to the investor that pays the company which in turn remits the net sales proceeds to the client agriculture loans the company provides agriculture loans for shortterm livestock and crop production including rice cotton milo and corn farm equipment financing and agriculture real estate financing the company evaluates agriculture borrowers primarily based on their historical profitability level of experience in their particular industry segment overall financial capacity and the availability of secondary collateral to withstand economic and natural variations common to the industry because agriculture loans present a higher level of risk associated with events caused by nature the company routinely makes onsite visits and inspections in order to identify and monitor such risks consumer loans consumer loans made by the company include direct acredit automobile loans recreational vehicle loans boat loans home improvement loans personal loans collateralized and uncollateralized and deposit account collateralized loans the terms of these loans typically range from to months and vary based upon the nature of collateral and size of loan generally consumer loans entail greater risk than do real estate secured loans particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or collateralized by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles in such cases any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan balance the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment in addition consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrowers continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss divorce illness personal bankruptcy or death furthermore the application of various federal and state laws may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans loan maturities the contractual maturity ranges of the companys loan portfolio by type of loan and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of december are summarized in the following table contractual maturities are based on contractual amounts outstanding and

losses methodology when a deterioration in projected cash flows is identified the company has several procedures in place to assist it in maintaining the overall quality of its loan portfolio the company has established underwriting guidelines to be followed by its officers and the company also monitors its delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends nevertheless the companys loan portfolio could become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions as part of the ongoing monitoring of the companys loan portfolio and the methodology for calculating the allowance for credit losses management grades each loan from to for certain loans in risk grades to a specific reserve may be required when calculating the allowance for credit losses the company generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest when the payment of principal or interest is delinquent for days or earlier in some cases unless the loan is in the process of collection and the underlying collateral fully supports the carrying value of the loan with respect to potential problem loans an evaluation of the borrowers overall financial condition is made together with an appraisal for loans collateralized by real estate to determine the need if any for possible writedowns or appropriate additions to the allowance for credit

chargeoff activity on warehouse purchase program loans during the periods presented table end the allowance for credit losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses the amount of the allowance for credit losses is affected by the following chargeoffs of loans that occur when loans are deemed uncollectible and decrease the allowance recoveries on loans previously charged off that increase the allowance and provisions for credit losses charged to earnings that increase the allowance based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio and consideration of the factors listed below management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the banks board of directors indicating any change in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for credit losses further adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations the companys allowance for credit losses consists of two components a specific valuation allowance based on probable losses on specifically identified loans and a general valuation allowance based on historical loan loss experience general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company in setting the specific valuation allowance the company follows a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the total loan portfolio and assigns risk grades to each loan through this loan review process the company maintains an internal list of impaired loans which along with the delinquency list of loans helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses all loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required for certain impaired loans the company allocates a specific loan loss reserve primarily based on the value of the collateral securing the impaired loan the specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis loans for which specific reserves are provided are excluded from the general valuation allowance described below in connection with this review of the loan portfolio the company considers risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories in assessing the quality of individual loans some of the risk elements include table start for family residential mortgage loans the borrowers ability to repay the loan including a consideration of the debt to income ratio and employment and income stability the loan to value ratio and the age condition and marketability of collateral table end table start for commercial mortgage loans and multifamily residential loans the debt service coverage ratio income from the property in excess of operating expenses compared to loan payment requirements operating results of the owner in the case of owneroccupied properties the loan to value ratio the age and condition of

nature of contracts for presale or prelease if any experience and ability of the developer and loan to value ratio table end table start for commercial and industrial loans the operating results of

estate agriculture loans the operating results experience and financial capability of the borrower historical and expected market conditions and the value nature and marketability of collateral table end in addition for each category the company considers secondary sources of income and the financial strength and credit history of the borrower and any guarantors in determining the amount of the general valuation allowance management considers factors such as historical loan loss experience concentration risk of specific loan types the volume growth and composition of the companys loan portfolio current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay and the value of collateral the evaluation of the companys loan portfolio through its internal loan review process general economic conditions other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company and other relevant factors based on a review of these factors for each loan type the company applies an estimated percentage to the outstanding balance of each loan type excluding any loan that has a specific reserve allocated to it the company uses this information to establish the amount of the general valuation allowance a change in the allowance for credit losses can be attributable to several factors most notably specific reserves identified for impaired loans historical credit loss information changes in environmental factors and growth in the balance of originated loans and the recategorization of fairvalued acquired loans to reunderwritten acquired loans which subjects such loans to the allowance methodology changes in the companys asset quality are reflected in the allowance in several ways specific reserves that are calculated on a loanbyloan basis and the qualitative assessment of all other loans reflect current changes in the credit quality of the loan portfolio historical credit losses on the other hand are based on a threeyear look back period which are then applied to estimate current credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio a deterioration in the credit quality of the loan portfolio in the current period would increase the historical credit loss factor to be applied in future periods just as an improvement in credit quality would decrease the historical credit loss factor the allowance for credit losses is further determined by the size of the loan portfolio subject to the allowance methodology and environmental factors that include companyspecific risk indicators and general economic conditions both of which are constantly changing the company evaluates the economic and portfoliospecific factors on a quarterly basis to determine a qualitative component of the general valuation allowance the factors include economic metrics business conditions delinquency trends credit concentrations nature and volume of the portfolio and other adjustments for items not covered by specific reserves and historical loss experience managements assessment of qualitative factors is a statistically based approach to determine the inherent probable loss associated with such factors based on the companys actual historical loan loss experience relative to economic and loan portfoliospecific factors at the time the losses occurred management is able to identify the probable level of incurred losses as of the date of measurement the correlation of historical loss experience with current economic conditions provides an estimate of inherent and probable losses that has not been previously factored into the general valuation allowance by the determination of specific reserves and recent historical losses additionally the company considers qualitative factors not easily quantified and the possibility of model imprecision utilizing the aggregation of specific reserves historical loss experience and a qualitative component management is able to determine the valuation allowance to reflect the full inherent probable loss in determining the allowance for credit losses management also considers the type of loan originated or reunderwritten acquired and the credit quality of the loan the company distinguishes between originated loans and reunderwritten acquired loans which are accounted for under the contractual yield method and fairvalued acquired loans consisting of nonpci loans and pci loans which are accounted for as purchased loans loans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value which includes an estimate of inherent credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans and therefore no corresponding allowance for credit losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition when a fairvalued acquired loan is renewed at its maturity date the loan is recategorized as a reunderwritten acquired loan when a fairvalued acquired loan is modified after acquisition the loan is independently evaluated subsequent to the modification decision to determine whether the modification was substantial and therefore requires that the loan be recategorized as a reunderwritten acquired loan this determination is based on a discounted cashflow analysis generally when a change in discounted cashflow of greater than is identified the fairvalued acquired loan becomes categorized as a reunderwritten acquired loan if and when a fairvalued acquired loan becomes a reunderwritten acquired loan the reunderwritten acquired loan is evaluated at the time of renewal or modification in accordance with the companys allowance for credit losses methodology described above nonpci loans that were not deemed impaired subsequent to the acquisition date are considered nonimpaired and are evaluated as part of the general valuation allowance nonpci loans that have not become impaired subsequent to acquisition are segregated into a pool for each acquisition for allowance calculation purposes for each pool the company estimates a hypothetical allowance for credit losses also referred to as an indicated reserve that is calculated in accordance with gaap requirements the company uses the acquired banks past loss history adjusted for qualitative factors to establish the indicated reserve the indicated reserve for each pool of nonpci loans is compared with the remaining discount for the respective pool to test for credit quality deterioration and the possible need for a loan loss provision to the extent the remaining discount of the pool is greater than the indicated reserve no additional allowance is necessary if the remaining discount of the pool is less than the indicated reserve the difference results in an increase to the allowance recorded through a provision for credit losses nonpci loans that have deteriorated to an impaired status subsequent to acquisition are evaluated for a specific reserve on a quarterly basis which when identified is added to the allowance for credit losses the company reviews impaired nonpci loans on a loanbyloan basis and determines the specific reserve based on the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and one of three factors expected future cash flows observable market price or fair value of the collateral because essentially all of the companys impaired nonpci loans have been collateraldependent the amount of the specific reserve historically has been determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral securing the nonpci loan with the recorded investment in such loan in the future the company will continue to analyze impaired nonpci loans on a loanbyloan basis and may use an alternative measurement method to determine the specific reserve as appropriate and in accordance with applicable accounting standards pci loans are individually monitored on a quarterly basis to assess for deterioration subsequent to acquisition and are only subject to the companys allowance methodology when a deterioration in projected cash flows is identified if a deterioration in cash flows is identified an additional provision for credit losses is made pci loans were recorded at their acquisition date fair values which were based on expected cash flows and included estimates of expected future credit losses the companys estimates of loan fair values at the acquisition date may be adjusted for a period of up to one year as the company continues to evaluate its estimate of expected future cash flows at the acquisition date if the company determines that losses arose after the acquisition date the additional losses will be reflected as a provision for credit losses an allowance for credit losses is not calculated for pci loans that have not experienced deterioration subsequent to the acquisition date see critical accounting policies above for more information as described in the section captioned critical accounting policies above the companys determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of judgment and complexity the companys analysis of qualitative or environmental factors on pools of loans with common risk characteristics in combination with the quantitative historical loss information and specific reserves provides the company with an estimate of inherent losses the allowance must reflect changes in the balance of loans subject to the allowance methodology as well as the estimated imminent losses associated with those loans in the companys case the million increase in the allowance for credit losses for the year ended december was primarily attributable to an increase in total loans partially offset by a decrease in specific reserves the following table shows the allocation of the allowance for credit losses among various categories of loans and certain other information as

for otherthantemporary impairment otti at least on a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation in determining otti management considers many factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions and whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery the assessment of whether an otherthantemporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at the time of such determination management has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as heldtomaturity until they mature at which time the company will receive full value for the securities furthermore as of december management does not have the intent to sell any of the securities classified as available for sale before a recovery of cost in addition management believes it is more likely than not that the company will not have to sell any of its investment securities before a recovery of cost as of december management believes any impairment in the companys securities is temporary and no impairment

states and political subdivisions collateralized mortgage obligations mortgagebacked securities total table end the contractual maturity of mortgagebacked securities and collateralized mortgage obligations is not a reliable indicator of their expected life because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time mortgagebacked securities monthly pay downs cause the average lives of the securities to be much different than their stated lives during a period of increasing interest rates fixed rate mortgagebacked securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently the average life of this security will be lengthened if interest rates begin to fall prepayments may increase thereby shortening the estimated life of this security at december and the company did not own securities of any one issuer other than the us government and its agencies for which aggregate adjusted cost exceeded of the consolidated shareholders equity at such respective dates the average tax equivalent yield of the securities portfolio was as of december compared with and as of december and respectively this decrease was primarily due to the investment in lower yielding securities additionally the average tax equivalent yield was negatively impacted by a lower tax rate in the average tax equivalent yield on the securities portfolio was based on a tax rate in and and a tax rate in the average yield excluding the tax equivalent adjustment was for the year ended december compared with for the year ended december and for the year ended december the change in the average securities portfolio over the comparable periods was primarily due to maturities of securities during the year ended december mortgagebacked securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and which are principally issued by federal agencies such as government national mortgage association ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac these securities are deemed to have high credit ratings and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest are guaranteed by the issuing agencies unlike us treasury and us government agency securities which have a lump sum payment at maturity mortgagebacked securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities premiums and discounts on mortgagebacked securities are amortized over the expected life of the security and may be impacted by prepayments as such mortgagebacked securities which are purchased at a premium will generally suffer decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because home owners tend to refinance their mortgages resulting in prepayments and an acceleration of premium amortization securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment as prepayments result in an acceleration of discount accretion at december of the mortgagebacked securities held by the company had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a weighted average life of years collateralized mortgage obligations cmos are bonds that are backed by pools of mortgages the pools can be ginnie mae fannie mae or freddie mac pools or they can be privatelabel pools cmos are designed so that the mortgage collateral will generate a cash flow sufficient to provide for the timely repayment of the bonds so long as the collateral cash flow is adequate to meet scheduled bond payments the mortgage collateral pool can be structured to accommodate various desired bond repayment schedules this is accomplished by dividing the bonds into classes to which payments on the underlying mortgage pools are allocated in different order the bonds cash flow for example can be dedicated to one class of bondholders at a time thereby increasing call protection to bondholders in privatelabel cmos losses on underlying mortgages are directed to the most junior of all classes and then to the classes above in order of increasing seniority which means that the senior classes have enough credit protection to be given the highest credit rating by the rating agencies deposits the companys lending and investing activities are primarily funded by deposits the company offers a variety of deposit

semiannually on each december and june through december from and including december through maturity or earlier redemption the interest rate will reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current threemonth libor rate plus payable on march june september and december of each year through the maturity date or earlier redemption the company may at its option beginning on december and on any scheduled interest payment date thereafter redeem the notes in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption any partial redemption will be made pro rata among all of the holders the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of the companys senior indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all existing and future debt and all other liabilities of the companys subsidiaries junior subordinated debentures on november in connection with the merger the company assumed million in junior subordinated debentures which were redeemed in december accordingly as of december and the company had no junior subordinated debentures outstanding interest rate sensitivity and market risk the companys asset liability and funds management policy provides management with the guidelines for effective funds management and the company has established a measurement system for monitoring its net interest rate sensitivity position the company manages its sensitivity position within established guidelines as a financial institution the companys primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility fluctuations in interest rates ultimately will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the companys assets and liabilities and the market value of all interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities other than those which have a short term to maturity interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income a loss of current fair market values or both the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while maximizing income the company primarily manages its exposure to interest rates by structuring its balance sheet in the ordinary course of business the company does not employ material amounts of instruments such as leveraged derivatives interest rate swaps financial options financial future contracts or forward delivery contracts for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk based upon the nature of the companys operations with the exception of how commodity prices may impact the companys borrowers ability to repay loans the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk the company is not involved in trading assets for its own account the companys exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the asset liability committee alco which consists of senior officers of the company in accordance with policies approved by the companys board of directors the alco formulates strategies based on appropriate levels of interest rate risk in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk the alco considers the impact on earnings and capital of the current outlook on interest rates potential changes in interest rates regional economies liquidity business strategies and other factors the alco meets regularly to review among other things the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate changes the book and market values of assets and liabilities unrealized gains and losses purchase and sale activities commitments to originate loans and the maturities of investments and borrowings additionally the alco reviews liquidity cash flow flexibility maturities of deposits and consumer and commercial deposit activity management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk an analysis of relationships between interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and an interest rate shock simulation model the company has traditionally managed its business to reduce its overall exposure to changes in interest rates the company uses an interest rate risk simulation model and shock analysis to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet contractual maturities and repricing opportunities of loans are incorporated in the model as are prepayment assumptions maturity data and call options within the investment portfolio assumptions based on past experience are incorporated into the model for nonmaturity deposit accounts the assumptions used are inherently uncertain and as a result the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income actual results will differ from the models simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies the company utilizes static balance sheet rate shocks to estimate the potential impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various rate scenarios this analysis estimates a percentage of change in the metric from the stable rate base scenario versus alternative scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates by instantaneously shocking a static balance sheet the following table summarizes the simulated change in net interest income at the 12month horizon considering the balance sheet composition as of december table start change in interest percent change in rates basis points net interest income base table end the results are significantly influenced by the behavior of demand money market and savings deposits and the overall balance sheet composition during such rate fluctuations the company has found that historically interest rates on these deposits change more slowly than changes in the discount and federal funds rates this assumption is incorporated into the simulation model and is generally not fully reflected in a gap analysis the assumptions incorporated into the model are inherently uncertain and as a result the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income actual results will differ from the models simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various strategies liquidity liquidity involves the companys ability to raise funds to support asset growth and acquisitions or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise to operate the company on an ongoing basis and manage unexpected events during and the companys liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in core deposits security and loan maturities amortizing investment and loan portfolios and advances from the fhlb of dallas although access to purchased funds from correspondent banks is available and has been utilized on occasion to take advantage of investment opportunities the company does not generally rely on this external funding source the following table illustrates during the years presented the mix of the companys funding sources and the average assets in which

table end the companys largest source of funds is deposits and its largest uses of funds are securities and loans the company does not expect a change in the source or use of its funds in the foreseeable future the companys average deposits increased for the year ended december compared with the year ended december the companys average loans increased for the year ended december compared with the year ended december the company predominantly invests excess deposits in governmentbacked securities until the funds are needed to fund loan growth the companys securities portfolio has a weighted average life of years and a modified duration of at december as of december the company had outstanding billion in commitments to extend credit million in commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit and million in commitments associated with unused capacity on warehouse purchase program loans since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused the total outstanding may not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements as of december the company had no exposure to future cash requirements associated with known uncertainties or capital expenditures of a material nature as of december the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared with million at december share repurchases in january the companys board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the company could repurchase up to or approximately million shares of its outstanding common stock over a twoyear period which expired on january no repurchases were made during the fourth quarter of the company repurchased million shares of its common stock at an average weighted price of per share during the year ended december on january t he company announced a stock repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to or approximately million shares of the companys outstanding common stock over a oneyear period expiring on january 2021at the discretion of management under the stock repurchase program the company could repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices through openmarket purchases or privately negotiated transactions depending upon market conditions contractual obligations the following table summarizes the companys contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of december other than deposit obligations and securities sold under repurchase agreements the companys future cash payments associated with its contractual obligations pursuant to its subordinated notes and fhlb advances and notes payable as of december are summarized below the future interest payments were calculated using the current rate in effect at

consolidated balance sheets the company enters into these transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers these transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit which involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets the companys commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit unused capacity on warehouse purchase program loans and commitments to extend credit expiring by period as of december are summarized below since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements table start year or less

to extend credit total table end standby letters of credit standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the payment by or performance of a customer to a third party if the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party the company would be required to fund the commitment the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment if the commitment is funded the company would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer the companys policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements unused capacity on warehouse purchase program loans for warehouse purchase program loans the company has established a maximum purchase facility amount but reserves the right at any time to refuse to buy any mortgage loans offered for sale by its mortgage banking company customers for any reason commitments to extend credit the company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses at specified rates and for specific purposes substantially all of the companys commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding the company minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for credit losses capital resources capital management consists of providing equity to support the companys current and future operations the company is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the federal reserve board and the bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements imposed by the fdic both the federal reserve board and the fdic have adopted riskbased capital requirements for assessing bank holding company and bank capital adequacy these standards define capital and establish minimum capital requirements in relation to assets and offbalance sheet exposure adjusted for credit risk in july the federal reserve board and the fdic published the basel iii capital rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the basel iii capital rules among other things introduced a new capital measure called common equity tier cet1 specified that tier capital consists of cet1 and additional tier capital instruments meeting specified requirements defined cet1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital and expanded the scope of the deductions adjustments as compared to existing regulations the basel iii capital rules require a capital conservation buffer composed entirely of cet1 in addition to the minimum riskweighted asset capital ratios the implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on january at the level and was phased in over a fouryear period increasing by that amount on each subsequent january until it reached on january since being fully phased in on january the basel iii capital rules require the company to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer composed entirely of cet1 of effectively resulting in minimum ratios of cet1 to riskweighted assets of tier capital to riskweighted assets of total capital that is tier plus tier to riskweighted assets of and tier capital to average quarterly assets as reported on consolidated financial statements known as the leverage ratio of the bank is subject to capital adequacy guidelines of the fdic that are substantially similar to the federal reserve boards guidelines also pursuant to fdicia the fdic has promulgated regulations setting the levels at which an insured institution such as the bank would be considered wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized under the fdics regulations the bank is classified wellcapitalized for purposes of prompt corrective action banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the capital conservation buffer is taken into account as detailed above will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income that is fourquarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income as of december the companys ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets was tier capital to riskweighted assets was total capital to riskweighted assets was and tier capital to average quarterly assets was it is important to note that warehouse purchase program loan volumes can increase significantly on the last day of the month potentially leading to a significant difference between the ending and average balance of warehouse purchase program loans for a given period at december warehouse purchase program loans totaled billion compared to an average balance of million because the capital ratios above are calculated using ending riskweighted assets and warehouse purchase program loans are riskweighted at the endofperiod increase in these balances can significantly impact the companys reported capital ratios total shareholders equity increased to billion at december compared with billion at december an increase of billion or this increase was primarily the result of the billion common stock issued in connection with the merger and net income of million partially offset by dividends paid on common stock of million and the common stock repurchases totaling million the following table provides a comparison of the companys and the banks leverage and riskweighted capital ratios as of december to the minimum and wellcapitalized
