transaction incentive compensation in june the federal reserve board occ and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should provide incentives that do not encourage risktaking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors these three principles are incorporated into the proposed revised rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified covered institutions released in may by a number of federal agencies including the federal reserve board fdic and sec the proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered institutions including the company and the bank that have at least billion in total assets which would include prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements and mandating appropriate recordkeeping under the proposed rule larger financial institutions with total consolidated assets of at least billion would also be subject to additional requirements the federal reserve board and fdic review as part of the regular riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations such as the company that are not large complex banking organizations these reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements the findings of this supervisory initiative will be included in reports of examination deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies in october the sec adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations including the nyse to implement listing standards that require listed companies to adopt policies mandating the recovery or clawback of excess incentivebased compensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding the date the listed company is required to prepare an accounting restatement including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period the final rule requires the company to adopt a clawback policy within days after such listing standard becomes effective cybersecurity in february the sec published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents these sec guidelines and any other regulatory guidance are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations in addition in march the sec proposed rules that would require disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents as well as cybersecurity risk management strategy and governance the federal banking regulators regularly issue new guidance and standards and update existing guidance and standards regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions financial institutions are expected to comply with such guidance and standards and to accordingly develop appropriate security controls and risk management processes if the company fails to observe such regulatory guidance or standards the company could be subject to various regulatory sanctions including financial penalties in november the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule that requires banking organizations to notify their primary banking regulator within hours of determining that a computersecurity incident has materially disrupted or degraded or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade the banking organizations ability to carry out banking operations or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its customer base its businesses and operations that would result in material loss or its operations that would impact the stability of the united states state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and many states including texas have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification information security and data privacy requirements the company expects this trend of statelevel activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which its customers are located risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks including litigation and enforcement risks are expected to be elevated for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by the company and its customers legislative and regulatory responses to the covid19 pandemic the lingering effects of the covid19 pandemic continue to create disruptions to the global economy to businesses and to the lives of individuals and there continues to be uncertainties on the impact to borrowers financial institutions and their counterparties and the ultimate impact of covid19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time there have been a number of regulatory actions intended to help mitigate the adverse economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on borrowers including several mandates from the bank regulatory agencies requiring financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers affected by the covid19 pandemic for example the bank regulatory agencies have encouraged financial institutions to report accurate information to credit bureaus regarding relief provided to borrowers and have urged the importance of financial institutions to continue assisting those borrowers impacted by the covid19 pandemic also on april the bank regulatory agencies issued a joint policy statement to facilitate mortgage servicers ability to place consumers in shortterm payment forbearance programs this policy statement was followed by a final rule on june that makes it easier for consumers to transition out of financial hardship caused by the covid19 pandemic further on december the coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act of was signed into law which also contains provisions that could directly impact financial institutions the ppp originally established under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act and extended under the consolidated appropriations act of authorizes financial institutions to make federally guaranteed loans to qualifying small businesses and nonprofit organizations further the federal bank regulatory agencies issued several interim final rules throughout the course of to neutralize the regulatory capital and liquidity effects for banks that participate in the federal reserve liquidity facilities the interim final rule issued on april clarifies that a zero percent risk weight applies to loans covered by the ppp for capital purposes and the interim final rule issued on may permits depository institutions to choose to exclude us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio these interim final rules were finalized on september legislative and regulatory initiatives from time to time various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in congress and state legislatures as well as by regulatory agencies such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the company in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions the company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted and if enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company a change in statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the company or the bank could have a material effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations effect on economic environment the policies of regulatory authorities including the monetary policy of the federal reserve board have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries among the means available to the federal reserve board to affect the money supply are open market operations in us government securities changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits these means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans investments and deposits and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits federal reserve board monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the business and earnings of the company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted
