transaction incentive compensation in june the federal reserve board occ and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should provide incentives that do not encourage risktaking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors these three principles are incorporated into the proposed revised rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified covered institutions released in may by a number of federal agencies including the federal reserve board fdic and sec the proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered institutions including the company and the bank that have at least billion in total assets which would include prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements and mandating appropriate recordkeeping under the proposed rule larger financial institutions with total consolidated assets of at least billion would also be subject to additional requirements the federal reserve board and fdic review as part of the regular riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations such as the company that are not large complex banking organizations these reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements the findings of this supervisory initiative will be included in reports of examination deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies cybersecurity in february the sec published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents these sec guidelines and any other regulatory guidance are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations the federal banking regulators regularly issue new guidance and standards and update existing guidance and standards regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions financial institutions are expected to comply with such guidance and standards and to accordingly develop appropriate security controls and risk management processes if the company fails to observe such regulatory guidance or standards the company could be subject to various regulatory sanctions including financial penalties in november the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule with compliance required by may that requires banking organizations to notify their primary banking regulator within

banking operations or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its customer base its businesses and operations that would result in material loss or its operations that would impact the stability of the united states state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and many states including texas have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification information security and data privacy requirements the company expect s this trend of statelevel activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which its customers are located risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks including litigation and enforcement risks are expected to be elevated for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking mobile banking and other technologybased products and services by the company and its customers legislative and regulatory responses to the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic continues to create extensive disruptions to the global economy to businesses and to the lives of individuals there have been a number of regulatory actions intended to help mitigate the adverse economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on borrowers including several mandates from the bank regulatory agencies requiring financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers affected by the covid19 pandemic as the current pandemic is ongoing and dynamic in nature there are many uncertainties related to covid19 including among other things its severity the duration of the outbreak the impact to customers employees and vendors the impact to the financial services and banking industry and the impact to the economy as a whole as well as the effect of actions taken or that may yet be taken or inaction by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to mitigate its impact both economic and healthrelated in light of the uncertainties and continuing developments the ultimate adverse impact of covid19 cannot be reliably estimated at this time the longerterm potential impact on the companys business could depend to a large extent on future developments and actions taken by regulatory authorities and other entities to contain covid19 and its economic impact furthermore the sustainability of the economic recovery observed in remains unclear and significant volatility could continue for a prolonged period as the potential exists for additional variants of covid19 including the recent omicron variant to impede the global economic recovery and exacerbate geographic differences in the spread of and response to covid19 the cares act which was enacted on march was intended to provide relief in the wake of the covid19 pandemic several provisions within the cares act led to action from the bank regulatory agencies and other provisions within the legislation that directly impacted financial institutions these regulatory and legislative actions may be expanded extended and amended as the pandemic and its economic impact continue the bank regulatory agencies have encouraged financial institutions to report accurate information to credit bureaus regarding relief provided to borrowers and have urged the importance of financial institutions to continue assisting those borrowers impacted by the covid19 pandemic also on april the bank regulatory agencies issued a joint policy statement to facilitate mortgage servicers ability to place consumers in shortterm payment forbearance programs this policy statement was followed by a final rule on june that makes it easier for consumers to transition out of financial hardship caused by the covid19 pandemic also on september the bank regulatory agencies issued a rule that deferred appraisal and evaluation requirements after the closing of certain residential and commercial real estate transactions through december further on december the coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act of was signed into law which also contains provisions that could directly impact financial institutions the ppp originally established under the cares act and extended under the caa authorizes financial institutions to make federallyguaranteed loans to qualifying small businesses and nonprofit organizations as described under the section captioned covid19 pandemic above also the federal reserve in cooperation with the department of the treasury has established many financing and liquidity programs the mslp is intended to keep credit flowing to small and midsized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the covid19 pandemic but now need financing to maintain operations the ppplf supplies liquidity to ppp participating financial institutions through term financing backed by ppp loans and the mmlf is intended to assist money market funds in meeting demands for redemptions by households and other investors enhancing overall market functioning and credit provision to the broader economy further the federal bank regulatory agencies issued several interim final rules throughout the course of to neutralize the regulatory capital and liquidity effects for banks that participate in the federal reserve liquidity facilities the interim final rule issued on april clarifies that a zero percent risk weight applies to loans covered by the ppp for capital purposes and the interim final rule issued on may permits depository institutions to choose to exclude us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the calculation of the supplementary leverage ratio these interim final rules were finalized on september legislative and regulatory initiatives from time to time various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in congress and state legislatures as well as by regulatory agencies such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the company in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions the company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted and if enacted the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company a change in statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the company or the bank could have a material effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations effect on economic environment the policies of regulatory authorities including the monetary policy of the federal reserve board have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries among the means available to the federal reserve board to affect the money supply are open market operations in us government securities changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits these means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans investments and deposits and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits federal reserve board monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the business and earnings of the company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted table start
