income increased to million compared to million in an increase of noninterest income grew from million in to million in reflecting higher mortgage banking revenue and capital markets income we also benefited from higher noninterest income attributable to a full year of klein contribution as compared to which only reflected two months of the klein operations our noninterest expenses were well controlled declining from million in to million in in january old national commenced implementation of a strategic plan the onb way which has various detailed business objectives designed to keep the companys clients at the center of all we do the onb way includes realigning the geographic organization structure to streamline our operating model through integrated commercial community banking and wealth teams we have also identified revenue and efficiency opportunities across the organization another component of the onb way is the optimization of our branch network this optimization which includes banking centers scattered throughout the footprint that will be consolidated in april reflects an ongoing shift among our clients toward digital banking solutions many of the facilities to be consolidated are in smaller markets several of which were added in recent years through partnership activity by state these consolidations include ten banking centers in both wisconsin and indiana five in michigan four in minnesota and two in kentucky the company expects to incur an estimated million in costs associated with the branch optimization in addition old national plans to close several nonbranch facilities at a later date and incur related miscellaneous charges of approximately million business outlook in the us economy grew by approximately as measured by the change in gdp while the growth rate was slower than the rate in the general consensus among leading economists is that the worst of the slowdown in economic growth has passed their outlook for is for the us economy gdp growth of approximately the projected drivers of this growth are from consumer spending which is dependent on personal income growth and is expected to slow somewhat over the course of coupled with an offset of industrial production as its current decline is expected to bottom out in and bolster business investment a strong start in residential housing is also expected to sustain us economic growth over the coming quarters an additional economic driver is the recordlow unemployment potential threats to the expected fragile economic expansion include increased personal debt that may choke off consumer spending possible resurgence of a china trade dispute or foreign trade friction energy price spikes us political infighting and uncertainty in interest rates lastly global geopolitical conflicts or natural disasters could also trigger a halt to the us economic expansion we remain a community bank at heart dedicated to serving and strengthening our communities as we evolve into a regional bank structure as old national implements this strategic plan our mission has also evolved our objective is to transform old national into a commerciallyoriented regional bank that consistently delivers top quartile performance to clients team members shareholders and communities as old national moves from a generalist relationship management approach based on geography to a specialist relationship management approach based on business segmentations the fundamentals of basic banking do not change those fundamentals are loan growth noninterest income growth prudent capital deployment and expense management organic loan growth is a priority our loan production and pipeline are at high levels as we enter into and we are hopeful that the cycle of persistently high levels of prepayments has passed despite this we continue to adhere to our disciplined underwriting process our practice of recognizing underperforming credits early along with active engagement with these borrowers ultimately leads to lower credit losses credit quality remains strong and we have not experienced any specific sector credit related weaknesses yet are watching a small number of credits with the onset of the onb way we have made investments in our noninterest income businesses in technology and personnel accordingly we are optimistic for continued expansion in our acquisition strategy has not changed we remain an active looker in our target markets and a highly selective disciplined buyer we wait patiently for the perfect pitch while we remain focused on execution as we look ahead to we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage financial highlights the following table sets forth certain financial highlights of old national table start three months

table start represents a nongaap financial measure refer to nongaap financial measures section for reconciliations to gaap financial measures table end comparison of fiscal years and net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings comprising of revenues net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors primarily the volume and mix of earning assets funding sources and interest rate fluctuations other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans prepayment risk on mortgage and investmentrelated assets and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities the federal reserve lowered the discount rate by basis points in the second half of at december the treasury yield curve was flat from the 3month treasury to the 5year treasury with a spread of basis points continued flatness of the yield curve could cause our interest rate spread to decline which may result in a decrease in our net interest income however management has taken balance sheet restructuring derivative and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate this risk loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources factors such as general economic activity federal reserve monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize the mix of assets and funding net interest income and margin net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interestbearing liabilities for analytical purposes net interest income is also presented in the table that follows adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our taxexempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same aftertax yield as a taxable asset we used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of for and and for this analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to taxexempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and taxexempt assets management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis therefore management believes these measures provide useful

on loans individually evaluated for impairment partially offset by loan growth continued loan growth in future periods a decline in our current level of recoveries or an increase in chargeoffs could result in an increase in provision expense additionally with the adoption of cecl beginning on january provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in cecl model assumptions of credit

other income decreased million in compared to primarily due to a million gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio in the second quarter of also contributing to the decrease in other income was the recognition of deferred gains on sale leaseback transactions of million in the deferred gains were eliminated as a cumulativeeffect adjustment upon adoption of the new accounting guidance in topic

investments decreased million in compared to the recognition of tax credit amortization expense is contingent upon the successful rehabilitation of a historic building or completion of a solar project within the reporting period many factors including weather labor availability building regulations inspections and other unexpected construction delays related to a rehabilitation project can cause a project to exceed its estimated completion date see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our tax credit investments other expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to lower charitable contributions of million and writedowns on longlived assets in related to branch consolidations provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes the major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on taxexempt securities and loans the effective tax rate was in compared to in the higher effective tax rate in compared to was primarily the result of a de crease in federal tax credits available as well as an increase in pretax book income see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on old nationals income tax provision comparison of fiscal years and in

average earning assets increased basis points from in to in the provision for loan losses was an expense of million in compared to an expense of million in chargeoffs remained low during and we continued to see positive trends in credit quality noninterest income increased million in compared to primarily due to a million gain on the sale of wisconsin branches and higher noninterest income attributable to the anchor mn and klein partnerships this increase was partially offset by lower net securities gains and recoveries on loans originated by anchorbank wi that had been fully chargedoff prior to the acquisition totaling million noninterest expense increased million in compared to primarily due to higher operating expenses and acquisition and integration costs associated with anchor mn and klein also contributing to the increase in noninterest expense was higher a mortization of tax credit investments in reflecting the completion of investment tax credit projects higher salaries and benefits and higher charitable contributions the provision for income taxes was million in compared to million in old nationals effective tax rate was in compared to in the lower effective tax rate in compared to is the result of million of additional tax expense recorded in for the revaluation of deferred tax assets due to the lowering of the federal corporate tax rate to and an increase

securities earning assets our earning assets are comprised of investment securities portfolio loans loans held for sale money market investments interest earning accounts with the federal reserve and equity securities earning assets were billion at december an increase of compared to billion at december investment securities we classify the majority of our investment securities as availableforsale to give management the flexibility to sell the securities prior to maturity if needed based on fluctuating interest rates or changes in our funding requirements during the fourth quarter of we inadvertently sold six heldtomaturity classified municipal bond investment securities valued at million for a gain of million after the trade settled we determined the sale of the heldtomaturity investment securities was not one of the permissible sale exceptions afforded by the current accounting guidance accordingly we reclassified the entire heldtomaturity portfolio totaling million into our availableforsale portfolio which increased capital by million additionally management does not expect to use the heldtomaturity category for at least the next two years this action provides increased liquidity which enables old national to mitigate interest rate risk differently but just as effectively as the heldtomaturity category provided old national equity securities are recorded at fair value and totaled million at december compared to million at december at december the investment securities portfolio including equity securities was billion compared to billion at december an increase of million or investment securities represented of earning assets at december compared to at december excess liquidity generated in resulted in a higher percentage of investment securities compared to december stronger commercial loan demand in the future could result in managements decision to reduce the securities portfolio as of december management does not intend to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position and does not believe we will be required to sell such securities the investment securities availableforsale portfolio had net unrealized gains of million at december compared to net unrealized losses of million at december net unrealized gains losses increased from december to december reflecting higher net unrealized gains on mortgagebacked securities and state and political subdivision securities due to a decline in longterm interest rates the increase in net unrealized gains also reflected the reclassification of the heldtomaturity portfolio which included a net unrealized gain of million the investment securities availableforsale portfolio had an effective duration of at december compared to at december effective duration measures the percentage change in value of the portfolio in response to a change in interest rates generally there is more uncertainty in interest rates over a longer average maturity resulting in a higher duration percentage the weighted average yields on investment securities were in and in at december old national had a concentration of investment securities issued by certain states and their political subdivisions with the following aggregate market values million by indiana which represented of shareholders equity and million by texas which represented of shareholders equity of the

inherent in extending credit we maintain an allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses incurred in the consolidated loan portfolio managements evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans pools of homogeneous loans assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio and historical loss experience additional information about our allowance for loan losses is included in the risk management credit risk section of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes and to the consolidated financial statements at december the allowance for loan losses was million a decrease of million compared to million at december continued loan growth in future periods a decline in our current level of recoveries or an increase in chargeoffs could result in an increase in provision expense additionally with the adoption of cecl beginning on january provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in cecl model assumptions of credit quality macroeconomic factors and conditions and loan composition which drive the allowance for credit losses balance as a percentage of total loans excluding loans held for sale the allowance was at december and december the provision for loan losses was an expense of million in compared to an expense of million in for commercial loans the allowance for loan losses increased by million at december compared to december

losses for residential real estate loans as a percentage of that portfolio was at december and december the allowance for loan losses for consumer loans as a percentage of that portfolio increased to at december from at december old national will adopt asu no financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments cecl effective january the main objective of this amendment is to provide financial statement users with more decisionuseful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date the amendment requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts financial institutions and other organizations will now use forwardlooking information to enhance their credit loss estimates old national expects to recognize a onetime cumulative effect adjustment increasing the allowance for loan losses because we do not have final approval from our oversight and governance committees we are estimating an increase to the allowance for credit losses of approximately million to million upon adoption which includes a range of million to million for offbalance sheet exposures the vast majority of this increase is related to the acquired loan portfolio under the current accounting guidance any remaining unamortized loan discount on an individual loan can be used to offset a chargeoff for that loan so the allowance for loan losses needed for the acquired loans is reduced by the remaining loan discounts the new accounting under the asu removes the ability to offset a chargeoff against the remaining loan discount and requires an allowance for credit losses to be recognized in addition to the loan discount the ultimate impact of adopting the asu and at each subsequent reporting period is highly dependent on credit quality macroeconomic forecasts and conditions composition of our loans and availableforsale securities portfolio along with other management judgements the transition adjustment to record the allowance for credit losses may fall outside of managements estimated increase based on material changes in these dependencies specifically the macroeconomic forecast and conditions and loan composition used in calculating the allowance for credit losses upon the adoption of cecl old national does not expect a material allowance for credit losses to be recorded on its availableforsale debt securities under the newly codified availableforsale debt security impairment model as the majority of these securities are government agencybacked securities for which the risk of loss is minimal see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the companys adoption of cecl allowance for losses on unfunded commitments we maintain an allowance for losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements the allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment this allowance is classified as a liability on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities while the corresponding provision for these loan losses is recorded as a component of other expense the allowance for losses on unfunded commitments was million at december compared to million at december loans held for sale mortgage loans held for immediate sale in the secondary market were million at december compared to million at december certain mortgage loans are committed for sale at or prior to origination at a contracted price to an outside investor other mortgage loans held for immediate sale are hedged with tba forward agreements and committed

commercial commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition expansion working capital and other general business purposes lease financing consists of direct financing leases and are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment the credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant a determination is made as to the applicants ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved in addition to an evaluation of the applicants financial condition a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment such as additional collateral or personal guarantees to be relied upon in the transaction credit agency reports of the applicants credit history supplement the analysis of the applicants creditworthiness commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors developers and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic market areas we serve indiana kentucky michigan wisconsin and minnesota these loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at ltv margins deemed appropriate for the property type quality location and sponsorship generally these ltv ratios do not exceed the commercial properties are predominantly nonresidential properties such as retail centers industrial properties and to a lesser extent more specialized properties substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area in the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower in evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan we primarily emphasize the ratio of the propertys projected net cash flows to the loans debt service requirement the debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate in addition a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principals of the borrower in most cases we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien fire and extended coverage casualty insurance and flood insurance if appropriate in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property in addition business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income business income from an owneroccupant or the sale of the property to an enduser we may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixedprice construction contracts performance and payment bonding controlled disbursements and presale contracts or prelease agreements consumer we offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category these loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios liquidity and credit scores a maximum ltv ratio of is generally required although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance or other mitigating factors we offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first third fifth or seventh year depending on the product and are based on fullyindexed rates such as libor we do not offer paymentoption facilities subprime loans or any product with negative amortization home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower the underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permit borrowing availability in the aggregate up to of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination we offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans with variable rate loans underwritten at fullyindexed rates decisions are primarily based on ltv

at december old national may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans the decision to restructure a loan versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan may benefit old national by increasing the ultimate probability of collection any loans that are modified are reviewed by old national to identify if a tdr has occurred which is when for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties old national bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status the modification of the terms of such loans include one or a combination of the following a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan loans modified in a tdr are typically placed on nonaccrual status until we determine the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months if we are unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss for large commercial type loans each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances generally old national charges off small commercial loans scored through our small business credit center with contractual balances under that are days or more delinquent and do not have adequate collateral support for residential and consumer loans a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes to days past due whichever is earlier for commercial tdrs an allocated reserve is established within the allowance for loan losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed value to determine the value of the loan one of the following methods is selected the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate the loans observable market price or the fair value of the collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent the allocated reserve is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value if there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loans expected future cash flows impairment is recalculated and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly when a residential or consumer loan is identified as a tdr the loan is typically written down to its collateral value less selling costs at december our tdrs consisted of million of commercial loans million of commercial real estate

old national had committed to lend an additional million to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as tdrs compared to million at december the terms of certain other loans were modified during and that did not meet the definition of a tdr it is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that during the period have been renewed have entered into a forbearance agreement have gone from principal and interest to interest only or have extended the maturity date in order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification the evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy we also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate additional collateral or a bona fide guarantee we also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or the delay in a payment pci loans are not considered impaired until after the point at which there has been a degradation of cash flows below our expected cash flows at acquisition if a pci loan is subsequently modified and meets the definition of a tdr it will be removed from pci accounting and accounted for as a tdr only if the pci loan was being accounted for individually if the pci loan is being accounted for as part of a pool it will not be removed from the pool at december it has not been necessary to remove any loans from pci accounting in general once a modified loan is considered a tdr the loan will always be considered a tdr and therefore impaired until it is paid in full otherwise settled sold or charged off however guidance also permits for loans to be removed from tdr status when subsequently restructured under these circumstances at the time of the subsequent restructuring the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties and this is documented by a current credit evaluation at the time of the restructuring under the terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement the institution has granted no concession to the borrower and the subsequent restructuring agreement includes market terms that are no less favorable than those that would be offered for a comparable new loan for loans subsequently restructured that have cumulative principal forgiveness the loan should continue to be measured in accordance with asc receivables overall however consistent with asc troubled debt restructurings by creditors creditor disclosure of troubled debt restructurings the loan would not be required to be reported in the years following the restructuring if the subsequent restructuring meets both of these criteria has an interest rate at the time of the subsequent restructuring that is not less than a market interest rate and is performing in compliance with its modified terms after the subsequent restructuring to provide for the risk of loss inherent in extending credit we maintain an allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses incurred in the consolidated loan portfolio managements evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans

risk that the estimated fair value of our assets liabilities and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes the objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity potential cash flows sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities especially those that earn or pay interest are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates such as general economic and financial conditions customer preferences historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its agencies particularly the federal reserve in managing interest rate risk we through the funds management committee a committee of the board of directors establish guidelines for asset and liability management including measurement of short and longterm sensitivities to changes in interest rates based on the results of our analysis we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including table start adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities table end table start changing product pricing strategies table end table start modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio or table end table start using derivative financial instruments to a limited degree table end a key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on old national the model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario the base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels the model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions the following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a twoyear cumulative horizon based on the assetliability model as of december and table start immediate rate decrease immediate rate increase  in thousands basis points base

investment securities loans total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base table end our asset sensitivity increased year over year primarily due to changes in our hedging strategies balance sheet mix investment duration and prepayment speed behavior a key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the repricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts which have no contractual maturity dates because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results for this reason we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes including shocks ramps yield curve flattening yield curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested at december our projected net interest income sensitivity based on the assetliability models we utilize was within the limits of our interest rate risk policy for the scenarios tested we use derivative instruments primarily interest rate swaps collars and floor spreads to mitigate interest rate risk including certain cash flow hedges on variablerate assets and liabilities with a notional amount of million at december our derivatives had an estimated fair value gain of million at december compared to an estimated fair value gain of million at december see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources the funds management committee of the board of directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and along with the balance sheet management committee monitors liquidity risk the objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and costeffective manner management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts we maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds however deposit flows calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgagerelated securities are strongly influenced by interest rates the housing market general and local economic conditions and competition in the

the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable incurred losses in the consolidated loan portfolio managements evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans pools of homogeneous loans assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio and historical loss experience the allowance represents managements best estimate but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance likewise an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance in either instance unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations table end the allowance is increased through a provision charged to operating expense uncollectible loans are chargedoff through the allowance recoveries of loans previously chargedoff are added to the allowance a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that contractual interest and principal payments will not be collected either for the amounts or by the dates as scheduled in the loan agreement our policy for recognizing income on impaired loans is to accrue interest unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of principal or interest we monitor the quality of our loan portfolio on an ongoing basis and use a combination of detailed credit assessments by relationship managers and credit officers historic loss trends and economic and business environment factors in determining the allowance for loan losses we record provisions for loan losses based on current loans outstanding grade changes mix of loans and expected losses a detailed loan loss evaluation on an individual loan basis for our highest risk loans is performed quarterly management follows the progress of the economy and how it might affect our borrowers in both the near and the intermediate term we have a formalized and disciplined independent loan review program to evaluate loan administration credit quality and compliance with corporate loan standards this program includes periodic regular reviews of problem loan reports delinquencies and chargeoffs table start judgments and uncertainties we utilize a pdlgd model as a tool to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for performing commercial and commercial real estate loans the pd is forecast using a transition matrix to determine the likelihood of a customers aqr migrating from its current aqr to any other status within the time horizon transition rates are measured using old nationals own historical experience the model assumes that recent historical transition rates will continue into the future the lgd is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults the sum of all net chargeoffs for a particular portfolio segment are divided by all loans that have defaulted over a given period of time the expected loss derived from the model considers the pd lgd and exposure at default additionally qualitative factors such as changes in lending policies or procedures and economic business conditions are also considered table end we use h istoric loss ratios adjusted for economic conditions to determine the appropriate level of allowance for residential real estate and consumer loans table start effect if actual results differ from assumptions the allowance represents managements best estimate but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance likewise an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance in either instance unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations table end managements analysis of probable losses in the portfolio at december resulted in a range for allowance for loan losses of million the range pertains to general fasb asc contingencies reserves for both retail and performing commercial loans specific fasb asc receivables reserves do not have a range of probable loss due to the risks and uncertainty associated with the economy and our projection of loss rates inherent in the portfolio we establish a range of probable outcomes a highend estimate and a lowend estimate and evaluate our position within this range the potential effect to net income based on our position in the range relative to the high and low endpoints is a decrease of million and an increase of million respectively after taking into account the tax effects these sensitivities are hypothetical and may not represent actual results derivative financial instruments table start description as part of our overall interest rate risk management we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements all of the derivative financial instruments we use have an active market and indications of fair value can be readily obtained we are not using the shortcut method of accounting for any fair value derivatives table end table start judgments and uncertainties the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge

the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit table end table start effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement would result in a reduction in our effective income tax
