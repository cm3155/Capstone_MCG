that may be represented by other companies executive summary in december a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 was reported in wuhan china the covid19 virus continues to aggressively spread globally and has spread to over countries including all states in the united states a prolonged covid19 outbreak or any other epidemic that harms the global economy us economy or the economies in which we operate could adversely affect our operations while the spread of the covid19 virus has minimally impacted our operations as of march we may experience temporary closures of our offices andor suspension of certain services until it is safe to open and return to work the ultimate effect of covid19 on the companys business will depend on numerous factors and future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time it is unknown how long the covid19 pandemic will last or when restrictions on individuals and businesses will be lifted and businesses and their employees will be able to resume normal activities further additional information may emerge regarding the severity of covid19 and additional actions may be taken by federal state and local governments to contain covid19 or treat its impact changes in the behavior of customers businesses and their employees as a result of the covid19 pandemic including social distancing practices even after formal restrictions have been lifted are also unknown as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken to contain it or reduce its impact the company may experience changes in the value of collateral securing outstanding loans reductions in the credit quality of borrowers and the inability of borrowers to repay loans in accordance with their terms these and similar factors and events may have substantial negative effects on the business financial condition and results of operations of the company and its customers our response to covid19 is focused on consumers small business and commercial clients team members and communities among the many items we are doing old national has committed million to covid19 relief efforts as well as approving loan payment extensions waiving or refunding certain banking fees and assisting clients with the paycheck protection program we have adjusted our branch hours decreased lobby usage and enabled team members to work remotely despite this challenging environment old national is still open for business we continue to lend to qualified businesses for working capital and general business purposes we adopted cecl on january which increased our existing allowance by million our acquired loan portfolio represents approximately million or of this increase with the remaining million or related to our legacy loan portfolio this increase was booked as a cumulative effect adjustment to equity and did not flow through the income statement during the quarter we recorded a provision expense for loan losses of million this provision expense factored in an estimated future impact for the covid19 pandemic as previously disclosed in january of old national commenced implementation of a strategic plan the onb way which includes realigning the geographic organization structure to streamline our operating model through integrated commercial community banking and wealth teams we have also identified revenue and efficiency opportunities as well as optimizing our branch network as our clients migrate toward digital banking solutions we consolidated smaller market banking centers on or before april by state these consolidations include ten banking centers in both wisconsin and indiana five in michigan four in minnesota and two in kentucky we incurred million in costs associated with the branch optimization million in severance costs and million in other related costs several nonbranch facilities will be closed at a later date and we will incur related charges of approximately million as old national moves from a generalist relationship management approach based on geography to a specialist relationship management approach based on business segmentations the fundamentals of our basic banking model do not change those fundamentals are loan growth noninterest income growth prudent capital deployment and expense management during the first quarter of net income was million or per diluted share net income was million or per diluted share for the first quarter of we have continued to remix our earning assets towards more productive commercial and commercial real estate loans and out of indirect and other loans loans our loan balances excluding loans held for sale increased million to billion at march compared to billion at december this was primarily driven by growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans we reported commercial loan production of million in the first quarter of and the pipeline totaled billion at march net interest income for the three months ended march compared to the three months ended march our net interest income decreased primarily due to decreased loan yields partially offset by lower costs of interestbearing liabilities net interest income decreased in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of primarily due to decreased loan yields lower accretion income and lower interest collected on nonaccrual loans partially offset by lower costs of interestbearing liabilities noninterest income noninterest income increased to million in the three months ended march compared to the three months ended march primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenue and million of debt securities gains in the first quarter of compared to million of debt securities losses in the first quarter of the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of increased million reflecting higher mortgage banking revenue and higher debt securities gains expenses noninterest expenses increased million in the three months ended march compared to the three months ended march the increase was primarily attributable to million of charges related to the onb way strategic initiative and higher amortization of tax credit investments the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of increased million also reflecting the higher charges related to the onb way strategic initiative results of operations the following

recoveries to average loans beginning january calculation is based on current expected loss methodology prior to january calculation is based on incurred loss methodology represents a nongaap financial measure refer to nongaap financial measures section for reconciliations to gaap financial measures net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings comprising of revenues for the three months ended march net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors primarily the volume and mix of earning assets funding sources and interest rate fluctuations other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans prepayment risk on mortgage and investmentrelated assets and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities as a result of the spread of covid19 economic uncertainties have arisen that are likely to negatively impact net interest income other financial impacts could occur though such potential impacts are unknown at this time during the first quarter of interest rates fell dramatically the federal reserve lowered the federal funds target rate to effectively the treasury yield curve steepened modestly as shortterm rates fell more than longterm rates our interest rate spread could decline which may result in a decrease in our net interest income however management has taken balance sheet restructuring derivative and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate this risk loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources factors such as general economic activity federal reserve monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize the mix of assets and funding net interest income and margin net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interestbearing liabilities for analytical purposes net interest income is also presented in the table that follows adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our taxexempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same aftertax yield as a taxable asset we used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of for all periods this analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to taxexempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and taxexempt assets management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis therefore management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons three months ended march  in thousands net interest income conversion to fully taxable equivalent net interest income taxable equivalent basis average earning assets net interest margin net interest margin taxable equivalent basis the decrease in net interest income for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march was primarily due to lower yields on average earning assets and higher average interestbearing liabilities partially offsetting these decreases were lower costs of average interestbearing liabilities and higher average earning assets in the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march net interest income for the three months ended march and included accretion income interest income in excess of contractual interest income associated with acquired loans accretion income totaled million in the three months ended march compared to million in the three months ended march we expect accretion income on loans to decrease over time but this may be offset by future acquisitions the following tables present the average balance sheet for each major asset and

volume is allocated equally between the rate and volume variances interest on investment securities and loans includes the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments of million and million respectively during the three months ended march using the federal statutory rate in effect of the decrease in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march was primarily due to lower yields on interest earning assets and higher average interestbearing liabilities partially offset by lower costs of interestbearing liabilities higher average earning assets and a change in the mix of average interest earning assets and interestbearing liabilities the yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points and the cost of interestbearing liabilities decreased basis points in the quarterly yearoveryear comparison the yield on interest earning assets is calculated by dividing annualized taxable equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets while the cost of interestbearing liabilities is calculated by dividing annualized interest expense by average interestbearing liabilities accretion income represented basis points of the net interest margin for the three months ended march compared to basis points for the three months ended march as a result of the spread of covid19 economic uncertainties have arisen that are likely to negatively impact net interest margin other financial impacts could occur though such potential impacts are unknown at this time average earning assets were billion for the three months ended march compared to billion for the three months ended march an increase of million or the increase in average earning assets was primarily due to an increase in average investment securities the loan portfolio including loans held for sale which generally has an average yield higher than the investment portfolio was of average interest earning assets for the three months ended march compared to for the three months ended march average loans including loans held for sale increased million for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march primarily due to an increase in average commercial real estate and residential real estate loans partially offset by lower average commercial and consumer loans average investments increased million for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march reflecting higher fair values and excess liquidity average noninterestbearing deposits increased million for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march average interestbearing deposits were flat for the three months ended march when compared to the three months

for the three months ended march compared to million for the three months ended march net chargeoffs totaled million during the three months ended march compared to net chargeoffs of million during the three months ended march the higher provision for loan losses in the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march was driven by implementation of cecl which uses an economic forecast that now includes the impact of the coronavirus pandemic continued loan growth in future periods a decline in our current level of recoveries or an increase in chargeoffs could result in an increase in provision expense additionally with the adoption of cecl beginning on january provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in cecl model assumptions of credit quality macroeconomic factors and conditions and loan composition which drive the allowance for credit losses balance noninterest income we generate revenues in the form of noninterest income through client fees sales commissions and other gains and losses from our core banking franchise and other related businesses such as wealth management investment consulting and investment products the

million for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march reflecting million in consulting fees incurred in the first quarter of related to the onb way fdic assessment expenses decreased million for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march primarily due to the elimination of an fdic surcharge amortization of tax credit investments increased million for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march the recognition of tax credit amortization expense is contingent upon the successful completion of the rehabilitation of a historic building or completion of a solar project within the reporting period many factors including weather labor availability building regulations inspections and other unexpected construction delays related to a rehabilitation project can cause a project to exceed its estimated completion date see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our tax credit investments other expense increased million for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march primarily due to million of lease termination charges and impairments on longlived assets related to branch consolidations that were part of the onb way strategic initiative provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes the major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on taxexempt securities and loans the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was for the three months ended march compared to for the three months ended march in accordance with asc accounting for interim reporting the provision for income taxes was recorded at march based on the current estimate of the effective annual rate the lower effective tax rate during the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march was primarily the result of an increase in federal tax credits available see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information financial condition overview at march our assets were billion a million increase compared to assets of billion at december the increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial and commercial real estate loans as a result of the spread of covid19 economic uncertainties have arisen that are likely to negatively impact our financial condition any potential financial

requirements equity securities are recorded at fair value and totaled million at march compared to million at december at march the investment securities portfolio including equity securities was billion compared to billion at december a decrease of million investment securities represented of earning assets at march and december stronger commercial loan demand in the future could result in

securities the investment securities availableforsale portfolio had net unrealized gains of million at march compared to net unrealized gains of million at december net unrealized gains losses increased from december to march reflecting higher net unrealized gains on mortgagebacked securities due to a decline in longterm interest rates the investment portfolio had an effective duration of at march compared to at december effective duration measures the percentage change in value of the portfolio in response to a change in interest rates generally there is more uncertainty in interest rates over a longer average maturity resulting in a higher duration percentage the annualized average yields on investment securities on a taxable equivalent basis were for the three months ended march compared to for the three months ended march loans held for sale mortgage loans held for immediate sale in the secondary market were million at march compared to million at december certain mortgage loans are committed for sale at or prior to origination at a contracted price to an outside investor other mortgage loans held for immediate sale are hedged with tba forward agreements and

to keep our clients colleagues and communities safe these include temporary changes at our banking centers on friday march we began to serve clients through our drivethru windows or by appointment inside a banking center we are closely monitoring the covid19 outbreak and proactively planning for potential impacts on our clients and team members during this period of disruption for our clients facing unanticipated financial hardships we are providing various assistance to mutually mitigate the financial impact from covid19 credit risk credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligors inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms our primary credit risks result from our investment and lending activities investment activities we carry a higher exposure to loss in our pooled trust preferred securities which are collateralized debt obligations due to illiquidity in that market and the performance of the underlying collateral at march we had pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of million or less than of the availableforsale securities portfolio these securities remained classified as availableforsale and at march the unrealized loss on our pooled trust preferred securities was million the fair value of these securities should improve as we get closer to maturity but not in all cases all of our mortgagebacked securities are backed by us governmentsponsored or federal agencies municipal bonds corporate bonds and other debt securities are evaluated by reviewing the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market conditions see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details about our investment security portfolio counterparty exposure counterparty exposure is the risk that the other party in a financial transaction will not fulfill its obligation we define counterparty exposure as nonperformance risk in transactions involving federal funds sold and purchased repurchase agreements correspondent bank relationships and derivative contracts with companies in the financial services industry old national manages exposure to counterparty risk in connection with its derivatives transactions by generally engaging in transactions with counterparties having ratings of at least a by standard poors rating service or a2 by moodys investors service total credit exposure is monitored by counterparty and managed within limits that management believes to be prudent old nationals net counterparty exposure was a liability of million at march lending activities commercial commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition expansion working capital and other general business purposes lease financing consists of direct financing leases and are used by commercial customers to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment the credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant a determination is made as to the applicants ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved in addition to an evaluation of the applicants financial condition a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment such as additional collateral or personal guarantees to be relied upon in the transaction credit agency reports of the applicants credit history supplement the analysis of the applicants creditworthiness commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors developers and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic market areas we serve indiana kentucky michigan wisconsin and minnesota these loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at ltv margins deemed appropriate for the property type quality location and sponsorship generally these ltv ratios do not exceed the commercial properties are predominantly nonresidential properties such as retail centers industrial properties and to a lesser extent more specialized properties substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area in the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower in evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan we primarily emphasize the ratio of the propertys projected net cash flows to the loans debt service requirement the debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate in addition a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principals of the borrower in most cases we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien fire and extended coverage casualty insurance and flood insurance if appropriate in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property in addition business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income business income from an owneroccupant or the sale of the property to an enduser we may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixedprice construction contracts performance and payment bonding controlled disbursements and presale contracts or prelease agreements consumer we offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category these loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios liquidity and credit scores a maximum ltv ratio of is generally required although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance or other mitigating factors we offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first third fifth or seventh year depending on the product and are based on fullyindexed rates such as libor we do not offer paymentoption facilities subprime loans or any product with negative amortization home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower the underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permit borrowing availability in the aggregate up to of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination we offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans with variable rate loans underwritten at fullyindexed rates decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios and credit scores we do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles we originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships we require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans with us listed as loss payee our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicants overall financial capacity including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan although an applicants creditworthiness is the primary consideration the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount asset quality communitybased lending personnel along with regionbased independent underwriting and analytic support staff extend credit under guidelines established and administered by our enterprise risk committee this committee which meets quarterly is made up of outside directors the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies credit exposures peer comparisons problem loans and chargeoffs in addition the committee reviews and approves recommended loan policy changes to assure it remains appropriate for the current lending environment we lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in various industries including manufacturing agribusiness transportation mining wholesaling and retailing old national manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry product geography customer relationship and loan size at march our average commercial loan size was under and our average commercial real estate loan size was under in addition while loans to lessors of both residential and nonresidential real estate exceed of total loans no individual subsegment category within those broader categories reaches the threshold at march we had minimal exposure to foreign borrowers and no sovereign debt our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve primarily indiana kentucky michigan wisconsin and minnesota we have experienced minimal impact from covid19 as of march however the depth of this crisis is yet to be known and its effect is anticipated to be very broadbased our geographic footprint the midwest has not experienced the same shock as other parts of the country and we are hopeful that the relief programs we have put in place coupled with various governmental programs will ultimately blunt the economic strain to our clients management expects that trends in underperforming criticized and classified loans will be influenced by the

real estate owned at march were a basis point improvement from at march and a basis point improvement from at december nonaccrual loans decreased from march primarily due to a decrease in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans as a percentage of nonaccrual loans the allowance was at march compared to at march and at december beginning january the allowance is based on current expected loss methodology prior to january the allowance was based on incurred loss methodology total criticized and classified assets were million at march a decrease of million from march and an increase of million from december other classified assets include investment securities that fell below investment grade rating totaling million at march compared to million at march and million at december old national may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans the decision to restructure a loan versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan may benefit old national by increasing the ultimate probability of collection any loans that are modified are reviewed by old national to identify if a tdr has occurred which is when for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties old national bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status the modification of the terms of such loans include one or a combination of the following a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan loans modified in a tdr are typically placed on nonaccrual status until we determine the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months if we are unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss for large commercial type loans each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances generally old national charges off small commercial loans scored through our small business credit center with contractual balances under that are days or more delinquent and do not have adequate collateral support for residential and consumer loans a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes to days past due whichever is earlier for commercial tdrs an allocated reserve is established within the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed value to determine the computed value of the loan one of the following methods is selected the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate the loans observable market price or the fair value of the collateral value if the loan is collateral dependent the allocated reserve is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value if there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loans expected future cash flows impairment is recalculated and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly when a residential or consumer loan is identified as a tdr the loan is typically written down to its collateral value less selling costs at march tdrs consisted of million of commercial loans million of commercial real estate loans million of bbcc loans million of residential real estate loans million of direct consumer loans and million of home equity loans totaling million tdrs included within nonaccrual loans totaled million at march at december tdrs consisted of million of commercial loans million of commercial real estate loans million of bbcc loans million of residential real estate loans million of direct consumer loans and million of home equity loans totaling million tdrs included within nonaccrual loans totaled million at december old national has allocated specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified in tdrs totaling million at march and million of december at march old national had committed to lend an additional million to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as tdrs compared to million at december the terms of certain other loans were modified during and that did not meet the definition of a tdr it is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that during the period have been renewed have entered into a forbearance agreement have gone from principal and interest to interest only or have extended the maturity date in order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification the evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy we also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate additional collateral or a bona fide guarantee we also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or the delay in a payment in general once a modified loan is considered a tdr the loan will always be considered a tdr and therefore impaired until it is paid in full otherwise settled sold or charged off however guidance also permits for loans to be removed from tdr status when subsequently restructured under these circumstances at the time of the subsequent restructuring the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties and this is documented by a current credit evaluation at the time of the restructuring under the terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement the institution has granted no concession to the borrower and the subsequent restructuring agreement includes market terms that are no less favorable than those that would be offered for a comparable new loan for loans subsequently restructured that have cumulative principal forgiveness the loan should continue to be measured in accordance with asc receivables overall however consistent with asc troubled debt restructurings by creditors creditor disclosure of troubled debt restructurings the loan would not be required to be reported in the years following the restructuring if the subsequent restructuring meets both of these criteria has an interest rate at the time of the subsequent restructuring that is not less than a market interest rate and is performing in compliance with its modified terms after the subsequent restructuring we have developed relief programs to assist borrowers in financial need due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic the march statement issued by our banking regulators and titled the interagency statement on loan modifications and reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the coronavirus encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of covid19 additionally section of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act passed on march provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law from classification as a tdr as defined by gaap from the period beginning march until the earlier of december or the date that is days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the covid19 outbreak declared by the president of the united states under the national emergencies act usc et seq terminates accordingly we are offering shortterm modifications made in response to covid19 to borrowers who are current and otherwise not past due these include shortterm days or less modifications in the form of payment deferrals fee waivers extensions of repayment terms or other delays in payment that are insignificant the modifications completed in the three months ended march were immaterial the table below presents the volume of loan deferrals and approvals through april by loan category dollars in thousands approved number approved amount approved of portfolio commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate consumer total us small business administration paycheck protection program section of the cares act created the paycheck protection program ppp which appropriated billion in loans designed to provide a direct incentive for sole proprietors independent contractors selfemployed persons nonprofits and small businesses with less than employees allowing for narrow exceptions with businesses greater than employees to keep their workers on the payroll these loans will be fully forgiven if the funds are used for payroll costs interest on mortgages rent or utilities as long as at least of the forgiven amount was used for payroll additionally loan payments will also be deferred for six months the program started on april and was available through june or as long as the appropriated funding is available no collateral or personal guarantees were required neither the government nor lenders are permitted to charge the recipients any fees old national began accepting applications from qualified customers on april and has helped provide over billion in funding to over clients through the ppp until available funding for the ppp was fully appropriated on april additional appropriations in the amount of billion including billion set aside for small midsize and community lenders have been approved and the sba commenced acceptances on new ppp applications on april allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments loan chargeoffs net of recoveries totaled million for the three months ended march compared to million for the three months ended march annualized net chargeoffs recoveries to average loans were for the three months ended march compared to for the three months ended march management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of nonperforming loans and may consider the possibility of sales of troubled and nonperforming loans which could result in additional chargeoffs to the allowance for credit losses on loans beginning january we calculated allowance for credit losses using current expected credit losses methodology as of january old national increased the allowance for credit losses for loans by million and increased the allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments by million since the asu covers credit losses over the expected life of a loan as well as considering future changes in macroeconomic conditions the increase related to the acquired loan portfolio totaled million credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the companys loans held for investment portfolio credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses expected credit loss inherent in noncancelable offbalancesheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment is adjusted by a credit loss expense which is reported in earnings and reduced by the chargeoff of loan amounts net of recoveries accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses the allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of its loan portfolio segments these segments are further disaggregated into loan classes the level at which credit risk is monitored when computing the level of expected credit losses credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods the allowance level is influenced by loan volumes loan aqr migration or delinquency status changes in historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions the methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses has two basic components first an assetspecific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans and second a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics at march the allowance for credit losses for loans was million continued loan growth in future periods a decline in our current level of recoveries or an increase in chargeoffs could result in an increase in provision expense additionally with the adoption of cecl beginning on january provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in cecl model assumptions of credit quality macroeconomic factors and conditions and loan composition which drive the allowance for credit losses balance prior to january we calculated allowance for loan losses using incurred losses methodology at december the allowance for loan losses was million we maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements the allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet and totaled million at march prior to january we calculated allowance for losses on unfunded loan commitments using incurred losses methodology at december the allowance losses on unfunded commitments was million market risk market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets liabilities and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes the objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity potential cash flows sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities especially those that earn or pay interest are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates such as general economic and financial conditions customer preferences historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its agencies particularly the federal reserve in managing interest rate risk we through the funds management committee a committee of the board of directors establish guidelines for asset and liability management including measurement of short and longterm sensitivities to changes in interest rates based on the results of our analysis we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities changing product pricing strategies modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio or using derivative financial instruments to a limited degree a key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on old national the model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario the base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels the model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions the following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a two year cumulative horizon based on the assetliability model at march and immediate rate decrease immediate rate increase dollars in thousands basis points base basis points basis points basis points march projected interest income money market other interest earning investments and investment securities loans total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base march projected interest income money market other interest earning investments and investment securities loans total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base our asset sensitivity increased year over year primarily due to deposit pricing actions and changes in our hedging strategies balance sheet mix investment duration and prepayment speed behavior a key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the repricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts which have no contractual maturity dates because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results for this reason we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes including shocks ramps yield curve flattening yield curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested at march our projected net interest income sensitivity based on the assetliability models we utilize was within the limits of our interest rate risk policy for the scenarios tested we use cash flow and fair value hedges primarily interest rate swaps collars and floors to mitigate interest rate risk derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value of million at march compared to a net asset position with a fair value of million at december see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources the funds management committee of the board of directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and along with the balance sheet management committee monitors liquidity risk the objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and costeffective manner management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts we maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds however deposit flows calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgagerelated securities are strongly influenced by interest rates the housing market general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace we continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments a time deposit maturity schedule for old national bank is shown in the following table at march  in
