industry as a supplement to gaap the company provides nongaap performance results which the company believes are useful because they assist users of the financial information in assessing the companys operating performance where nongaap financial measures are used the comparable gaap financial measure as well as the reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure can be found in the following table the company presents net income per common share and net income applicable to common shares adjusted for certain notable items these items include mergerrelated charges associated with completed and pending acquisitions separation expense debt securities gainslosses cecl day nonpcd provision expense distribution of excess pension assets expense fdic special assessment expense gain on sale of visa class b restricted shares contract termination charges expenses related to the tragic april event at our downtown louisville location louisville expenses and property optimization charges management believes excluding these items from net income per common share and net income applicable to common shares may be useful in assessing the companys underlying operational performance since these items do not pertain to its core business operations and their exclusion may facilitate better comparability between periods management believes that excluding mergerrelated charges from these metrics may be useful to the company as well as analysts and investors since these expenses can vary significantly based on the size type and structure of each acquisition additionally management believes excluding these items from these metrics may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes the taxable equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and taxexempt assets interest income and yields on taxexempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxequivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes in managements view tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the company as well as users of the financial information in assessing the companys use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers these nongaap measures are valuable indicators of a financial institutions capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from shareholders equity and retain the effect of aoci in shareholders equity although intended to enhance understanding of the companys business and performance these nongaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to gaap in addition these nongaap financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and

environment as a percentage of nonaccrual loans the allowance for credit losses on loans was at september compared to at december total criticized and classified assets were billion at september an increase of million from december including million of criticized and classified loans related to the capstar acquisition excluding these loans total criticized and classified assets increased million reflecting the migration of certain borrowers primarily due to asset quality rating policy changes and the impact of the higher interest rate environment other classified assets include investment securities that fell below investment grade rating totaling million at september compared to million at december allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments net chargeoffs on loans totaled million during the three months ended september compared to million for the same period in annualized net chargeoffs to average loans were and for the three months ended september and respectively the three months ended september included net chargeoffs on pcd loans totaling on an annualized basis of average loans compared to net recoveries on pcd loans totaling on an annualized basis of average loans for the three months ended september net chargeoffs on loans totaled million during the nine months ended september compared to million for the same period in annualized net chargeoffs to average loans were and for the nine months ended september and respectively the nine months ended september and included net chargeoffs on pcd loans totaling and on an annualized basis of average loans respectively credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses on loans the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the companys loans held for investment portfolio credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses expected credit loss inherent in noncancelable offbalancesheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments is adjusted by a credit loss expense which is reported in earnings and reduced by the chargeoff of loan amounts net of recoveries accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses the allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments these segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk of the loan is monitored when computing the level of expected credit losses credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods the allowance level is influenced by loan volumes loan aqr migration or delinquency status changes in historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions the methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses on loans has two basic components first an assetspecific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans and second a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics the allowance for credit losses on loans was million at september compared to million at december the increase reflects million of allowance for credit losses on acquired pcd loans established through acquisition accounting adjustments as well as million through the provision for credit losses on loans in the nine months ended september to establish an allowance for credit losses on nonpcd loans both related to the capstar acquisition continued loan growth in future periods a decline in our current level of recoveries or an increase in chargeoffs could result in an increase in provision expense additionally provision expense may be volatile due to changes in cecl model assumptions of credit quality macroeconomic factors and conditions and loan composition which drive the allowance for credit losses balance we maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements the allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities while the corresponding provision for unfunded loan commitments is included in the provision for credit losses the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled million at september compared to million at december with the reduction driven primarily by a decrease in unfunded loan commitments that resulted from the funding of loans we increased the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loans commitments by million in the nine months ended september as a result of the capstar transaction see the section entitled risk factors in the companys annual report on form 10k for further discussion of our credit risk market risk market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets liabilities and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes the objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity potential cash flows sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities especially those that earn or pay interest are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates such as general economic and financial conditions client preferences historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its agencies particularly the federal reserve in managing interest rate risk we establish guidelines for asset and liability management including measurement of short and longterm sensitivities to changes in interest rates which are reviewed with the enterprise risk committee of our board of directors based on the results of our analysis we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities changing product pricing strategies modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio or using derivative financial instruments to a limited degree a key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the likely impact of changing interest rates on old nationals results of operations the model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario over a twoyear cumulative horizon resulting from an immediate change in interest rates using multiple rate scenarios the base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels the model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions due to the dynamics of future interest rate expectations we also measure and monitor interest rate risk using the forward curve which may be a more probable scenario of our interest rate exposure the forward curve represents the relationship between the price of forward contracts and the time to maturity of the forward contracts at a point in time presentation of the forward curve model is included in the following table as of september the following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a twoyear cumulative

rate in month given a gradual parallel ramp relative to the base implied forward scenario our projected net interest income increased year over year driven by loan growth and asset repricing due to current interest rates and economic conditions our overall strategy is consistent period over period as we continue to manage our balance sheet toward a neutral interest rate risk position in a disciplined manner a key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the repricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts which align with our approach to deposit pricing and are consistent period over period because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results for this reason we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes including shocks ramps yield curve flattening yield curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested we use cash flow and fair value hedges primarily interest rate swaps collars and floors to mitigate interest rate risk derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value gain of million at september compared to a net asset position with a fair value gain of million at december see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources we establish liquidity risk guidelines that we review with the enterprise risk committee of our board of directors and monitor through our assetliability executive management committee the objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and costeffective manner management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts we maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth to properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements on may we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds however deposit flows calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgagerelated securities are not as predictable as they are strongly influenced by interest rates events at other banking organizations the housing market general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace we continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the

prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not required in and is not currently required critical accounting estimates our most significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december certain of these accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities we consider these policies to be our critical accounting estimates the judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience future forecasts or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions actual results could differ from estimates which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding critical accounting estimates see the section titled critical accounting estimates included in item of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december there have been no material changes in the companys application of critical accounting estimates since december
