measure can be found in the following table the taxequivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and taxexempt assets interest income and yields on taxexempt securities and loans are presented using the current federal income tax rate of management believes that it is standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxequivalent basis and that it may enhance comparability for peer comparison purposes in managements view tangible common equity measures are capital adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the company as well as analysts and investors in assessing the companys use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers these nongaap measures are valuable indicators of a financial institutions capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from shareholders equity and retain the effect of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity although intended to enhance investors understanding of the companys business and performance these nongaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to gaap in addition these nongaap financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance see the previously provided tables

to the allowance for credit losses established on acquired nonpcd loans associated with the merger with first midwest in addition we recorded million of mergerrelated expenses including million attributable to the provision for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments we achieved strong fundamental results during the first quarter of loans our loan balances excluding loans held for sale increased billion to billion at march compared to billion at december this was primarily driven by our merger with first midwest in february of and strong commercial production we reported total commercial loan production of billion in the first quarter of and the commercial loan pipeline totaled billion at march net interest income net interest income increased million for the three months ended march compared to the three months ended march and million compared to the fourth quarter of primarily due to higher average earning assets from the merger and loan growth higher accretion income and lower costs of average interestbearing liabilities partially offsetting these increases were lower interest and fees related to ppp loans as well as higher average interestbearing liabilities noninterest income noninterest income increased million in the three months ended march compared to the three months ended march and million compared to the fourth quarter of the increases were primarily due to noninterest income attributable to the first midwest merger partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenues expenses noninterest expenses increased million in the three

fourth quarter of pandemic update as previously disclosed the covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that continue to adversely affect our operations during the three months ended march our historically careful underwriting practices diverse and granular portfolios and midwestbased footprint have helped minimize any adverse impact to old national the pandemic appears to be slowly receding and thus becoming less disruptive on the companys business financial condition results of operations and its clients as of march results of operations the following table sets forth

to average loans represents a nongaap financial measure refer to nongaap financial measures section for reconciliations to gaap financial measures net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings comprising of revenues for the three months ended march net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by many factors primarily the volume and mix of earning assets funding sources and interest rate fluctuations other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans prepayment risk on mortgage and investmentrelated assets and the composition and maturity of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities interest rates increased significantly during the first quarter of with the rate on the 2year us treasury increasing basis points from to the federal reserves federal funds rate increased basis points to a target range of to with the effective federal funds rate at at march the federal reserve is expected to continue to increase the federal funds rate throughout and into if interest rates increase our interest rate spread may improve which may result in an increase in our net interest income if interest rates decline our interest rate spread could decline which may result in a decrease in our net interest income however management has taken balance sheet restructuring derivative and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate this risk loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources factors such as general economic activity federal reserve monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize our mix of assets and funding net interest income and net interest margin net interest income is the excess of interest received from interestearning assets over interest paid on interestbearing liabilities for analytical purposes net interest income is presented in the table that follows adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our taxexempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same aftertax yield as a taxable asset we used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of for all periods this analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to taxexempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and taxexempt assets management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis therefore management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make better peer comparisons the following tables present the average balance sheet for each major asset and liability category its related interest income and yield or its expense and rate tax equivalent basis

allocated equally between the rate and volume variances interest on investment securities and loans includes the effect of taxable equivalent adjustments of million and million respectively during the three months ended march using the federal statutory rate in effect of the increase in net interest income for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march was primarily due to higher average earning assets from the merger and loan growth higher accretion income and lower costs of average interestbearing liabilities partially offsetting these increases were lower interest and fees related to ppp loans higher average interestbearing liabilities and lower yields on average earning assets accretion income associated with acquired loans and borrowings totaled million in the three months ended march compared to million in the three months ended march net interest income included interest and net fees on ppp loans totaling million for the three months ended march compared to million for the three months ended march unamortized fees on remaining ppp loans totaled million at march the basis point decrease in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march was primarily due to lower yields on interest earning assets partially offset by lower costs of interestbearing liabilities the yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points and the cost of interestbearing liabilities decreased basis points in the quarterly yearoveryear comparison the yield on interest earning assets is calculated by dividing annualized taxable equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets while the cost of interestbearing liabilities is calculated by dividing annualized interest expense by average interestbearing liabilities accretion income represented basis points of the net interest margin in the three months ended march compared to basis points for the three months ended march average earning assets were billion for the three months ended march compared to billion for the three months ended march an increase of billion or the increase in average earning assets was primarily due to the merger with first midwest in february in addition loan growth contributed to the increase in average earning assets average loans including

credit losses on acquired nonpcd loans associated with the first midwest merger continued loan growth in future periods a decline in our current level of recoveries or an increase in chargeoffs could result in an increase in provision expense additionally provision expense may be volatile due to changes in cecl model assumptions of credit quality macroeconomic factors and conditions and loan composition which drive the allowance for credit losses balance noninterest income we generate revenues in the form of noninterest income through client fees sales commissions and gains and losses

companyowned life insurance debt securities gains losses net other income total noninterest income noninterest income increased million for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march primarily due to the first midwest merger in february the increase in noninterest income was partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue which was impacted by the rate

loan commitments amortization of tax credit investments increased million and for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march the recognition of tax credit amortization expense is contingent upon the successful completion of the rehabilitation of a historic building or completion of a solar project within the reporting period many factors including weather labor availability building regulations inspections and other unexpected construction delays related to a rehabilitation project can cause a project to exceed its estimated completion date see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our tax credit investments provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes the major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on taxexempt securities and loans the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income loss was for the three months ended march compared to for the three months ended march in accordance with asc accounting for interim reporting the provision for income taxes was recorded at march based on the current estimate of the effective annual rate based on the current estimate the higher effective tax rate during the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march reflected higher postmerger estimated state effective tax rates an additional benefit of million related to sharebased payments and a onetime benefit of million due to the remeasurement of the companys deferred taxes postmerger both increased the effective tax rate for the quarter since the company reflected a pretax loss but are expected to reduce the overall fullyear tax rate once the company is in a pretax income position see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information financial condition overview at march our assets were billion a billion increase compared to assets of billion at december the increase was driven by the merger with first midwest in february of we have observed signs of an economic recovery in the united states with jobs consumer spending manufacturing and other indicators rebounding from their weakest levels our historically careful underwriting practices diverse

business financial condition results of operations and its clients as of march earning assets our earning assets are comprised of investment securities portfolio loans loans held for sale money market investments interest earning accounts with the federal reserve and equity securities earning assets were billion at march a billion increase compared to earning assets of billion at december driven by the merger with first midwest in february of investment securities we classify the majority of our investment securities as availableforsale to give management the flexibility to sell the securities prior to maturity if needed based on fluctuating interest rates or changes in our funding requirements during the first quarter of we transferred billion of securities availableforsale to heldtomaturity in light of the rate environment equity securities are recorded at fair value and totaled million at march compared to million at december the increase in equity securities was driven by the merger with first midwest in february of at march the investment securities portfolio including equity securities was billion compared to billion at december an increase of billion investment securities represented of earning assets at march compared to at december stronger commercial loan demand in the future could result in managements decision to reduce the securities portfolio at march we had no intent to sell any securities that were in an unrealized loss position nor is it expected that we would be required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery the investment securities availableforsale portfolio had net unrealized losses of million at march compared to net unrealized losses of million at december net unrealized losses increased from december to march primarily due to an increase in rates impacting market values for mortgagebacked us governmentsponsored entities and agencies and tax exempt municipal securities the investment portfolio had an effective duration of at march compared to at december effective duration measures the percentage change in value of the portfolio in response to a change in interest rates generally there is more uncertainty in interest rates over a longer average maturity resulting in a higher duration percentage the annualized average yields on investment securities on a taxable equivalent basis were for the

following discussion addresses these major risks credit market liquidity operationaltechnologycybersecurity and regulatorycompliancelegal credit risk credit risk represents the risk of loss arising from an obligors inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms our primary credit risks result from our investment and lending activities investment activities we carry a higher exposure to loss in our pooled trust preferred securities which are collateralized debt obligations due to illiquidity in that market and the performance of the underlying collateral at march we had pooled trust preferred securities with a fair value of million or less than of the availableforsale securities portfolio these securities remained classified as availableforsale and the unrealized loss on our pooled trust preferred securities was million at march the fair value of these securities is expected to improve as we get closer to maturity but may be adversely impacted by credit deterioration all of our mortgagebacked securities are backed by us governmentsponsored or federal agencies municipal bonds corporate bonds and other debt securities are evaluated by reviewing the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market conditions see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details about our investment security portfolio counterparty exposure counterparty exposure is the risk that the other party in a financial transaction will not fulfill its obligation we define counterparty exposure as nonperformance risk in transactions involving federal funds sold and purchased repurchase agreements correspondent bank relationships and derivative contracts with companies in the financial services industry old national manages exposure to counterparty risk in connection with its derivatives transactions by generally engaging in transactions with counterparties having ratings of at least a by standard poors rating service or a2 by

billion at march lending activities commercial commercial and industrial loans are made primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition expansion working capital and other general business purposes lease financing consists of direct financing leases and is used by commercial clients to finance capital purchases ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment the credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant a determination is made as to the applicants ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved in addition to an evaluation of the applicants financial condition a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment such as additional collateral or personal guarantees to be relied upon in the transaction credit agency reports of the applicants credit history supplement the analysis of the applicants creditworthiness commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to real estate investors developers and builders primarily domiciled in the geographic market areas we serve illinois indiana iowa kentucky michigan minnesota and wisconsin these loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate at ltv margins deemed appropriate for the property type quality location and sponsorship generally these ltv ratios do not exceed the commercial properties are predominantly nonresidential properties such as retail centers industrial properties and to a lesser extent more specialized properties substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market area in the underwriting of our commercial real estate loans we obtain appraisals for the underlying properties decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower in evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan we primarily emphasize the ratio of the propertys projected net cash flows to the loans debt service requirement the debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate in addition a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principals of the borrower in most cases we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien fire and extended coverage casualty insurance and flood insurance if appropriate in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property in addition business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income business income from an owneroccupant or the sale of the property to an enduser we may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixedprice construction contracts performance and payment bonding controlled disbursements and presale contracts or prelease agreements consumer we offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category these loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios liquidity and credit scores a maximum ltv ratio of is generally required although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance or other mitigating factors we offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first third fifth or seventh year depending on the product and are based on indexed rates such as prime we do not offer paymentoption facilities subprime loans or any product with negative amortization home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower the underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permit borrowing availability in the aggregate up to of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination we offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans with variable rate loans underwritten at fullyindexed rates decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios and credit scores we do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles we originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships we require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans with us listed as loss payee our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicants overall financial capacity including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan although an applicants creditworthiness is the primary consideration the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount asset quality communitybased lending personnel along with regionbased independent underwriting and analytic support staff extend credit under guidelines established and administered by management and overseen by our enterprise risk committee this committee which meets quarterly is made up of independent outside directors the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies credit exposures peer comparisons problem loans and chargeoffs in addition the committee provides oversight of loan policy changes as recommended by management to assure our policy remains appropriate for the current lending environment we lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in many diverse industries including among others manufacturing agribusiness transportation mining wholesaling and retailing old national manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry product geography client relationship and loan size at march our average commercial loan size was approximately and our average commercial real estate loan size was approximately in addition while loans to lessors of residential and nonresidential real estate exceed of total loans no individual subsegment category within those broader categories reaches the threshold at march we had minimal exposure to foreign

a tdr has occurred which is when for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties old national bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status the modification of the terms of such loans includes one or a combination of the following a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan loans modified in a tdr are typically placed on nonaccrual status until we determine that the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months if we are unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss for large commercial type loans each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances for residential and consumer loans a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes to days past due whichever is earlier for commercial tdrs an allocation is established within the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed value to determine the computed value of the loan one of the following methods is selected the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate the loans observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent the allocation is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value if there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loans expected future cash flows the allowance allocation is recalculated and adjusted accordingly when a residential or consumer loan is identified as a tdr the loan is typically written down to its collateral value less selling costs at march tdrs consisted of million of commercial loans million of commercial real estate loans million of bbcc loans million of residential real estate loans million of direct consumer loans and million of home equity loans totaling million tdrs included within nonaccrual loans totaled million at march at december tdrs consisted of million of commercial loans million of commercial real estate loans million of bbcc loans million of residential real estate loans million of direct consumer loans and million of home equity loans totaling million tdrs included within nonaccrual loans totaled million at december old national has established specific allowances for credit losses for clients whose loan terms have been modified as tdrs totaling million at march and million of december old national had not committed to lend any additional funds to clients with outstanding loans that were classified as tdrs at march or december the terms of certain other loans were modified during and that did not meet the definition of a tdr it is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that during the period have been renewed have entered into a forbearance agreement have gone from principal and interest to interest only or have extended the maturity date in order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification the evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy we also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate additional collateral or a bona fide guarantee we also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or the delay in a payment in general once a modified loan is considered a tdr the loan will always be considered a tdr until it is paid in full otherwise settled sold or charged off however guidance also permits for loans to be removed from tdr status when subsequently restructured under these circumstances at the time of the subsequent restructuring the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties and this is documented by a current credit evaluation at the time of the restructuring under the terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement the institution has granted no concession to the borrower and the subsequent restructuring agreement includes market terms that are no less favorable than those that would be offered for a comparable new loan for loans subsequently restructured that have cumulative principal forgiveness the loan should continue to be measured in accordance with asc receivables overall however consistent with asc troubled debt restructurings by creditors creditor disclosure of troubled debt restructurings the loan would not be required to be reported in the years following the restructuring if the subsequent restructuring meets both of these criteria has an interest rate at the time of the subsequent restructuring that is not less than a market interest rate and is performing in compliance with its modified terms after the subsequent restructuring allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments net chargeoffs on loans totaled million during the three months ended march compared to net recoveries of thousand for the three months ended march annualized net chargeoffs recoveries to average loans were for the three months ended march compared to for the three months ended march management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of nonperforming loans and may consider the possibility of sales of troubled and nonperforming loans which could result in additional chargeoffs to the allowance for credit losses on loans credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the companys loans held for investment portfolio credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses expected credit loss inherent in noncancelable offbalancesheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment is adjusted by a credit loss expense which is reported in earnings and reduced by the chargeoff of loan amounts net of recoveries accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses the allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments these segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk of the loan is monitored when computing the level of expected credit losses credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods the allowance level is influenced by loan volumes loan aqr migration or delinquency status changes in historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions the methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses has two basic components first an assetspecific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans and second a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics the allowance for credit losses for loans was million at march compared to million at december the increase reflects the initial allowance for credit losses established for acquired pcd loans totaling million related to the first midwest merger in addition the provision for credit losses expense in the three months ended march included million of initial provision for credit losses required on acquired nonpcd loans associated with the first midwest merger continued loan growth in future periods a decline in our current level of recoveries or an increase in chargeoffs could result in an increase in provision expense additionally provision expense may be volatile due to changes in cecl model assumptions of credit quality macroeconomic factors and conditions and loan composition which drive the allowance for credit losses balance we maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements the allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities while the corresponding provision for these credit losses is recorded as a component of other expense the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled million at march compared to million at december the increase in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was driven by the merger with first midwest in february of market risk market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets liabilities and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes the objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity potential cash flows sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities especially those that earn or pay interest are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates such as general economic and financial conditions client preferences historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its agencies particularly the federal reserve in managing interest rate risk we establish guidelines for asset and liability management including measurement of short and longterm sensitivities to changes in interest rates which is reviewed with the enterprise risk committee of our board of directors based on the results of our analysis we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities changing product pricing strategies modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio or using derivative financial instruments to a limited degree a key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the likely impact of changing interest rates on old nationals results of operations the model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario the base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels interest rates are floored at in the down basis points scenario the model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions the following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a

projected interest expense deposits borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base our asset sensitivity increased year over year primarily due to deposit growth higher mix of floating rate loans and changes in our hedging strategies a key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the repricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts which have no contractual maturity dates because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results for this reason we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes including shocks ramps yield curve flattening yield curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested at march our projected net interest income sensitivity based on the assetliability models we utilize was within the limits of our interest rate risk policy for the scenarios tested we use cash flow and fair value hedges primarily interest rate swaps collars and floors to mitigate interest rate risk derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value loss of million at march compared to a net asset position with a fair value gain of million at december see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources we establish liquidity risk guidelines that we review with the enterprise risk committee of our board of directors and monitor through our balance sheet management committee the objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and costeffective manner management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts we maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements on june we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds however deposit flows calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgagerelated securities are strongly influenced by interest rates the housing market general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace we continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments a maturity

included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december certain of these accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities we consider these policies to be our critical accounting estimates the judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience future forecasts or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions actual results could differ from estimates which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations business combination and goodwill description for acquisitions we are required to record the assets acquired including identified intangible assets such as core deposit and customer trust relationship intangibles and the liabilities assumed at their fair value the difference between consideration and the net fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill management uses significant estimates and assumptions to value such items including projected cash flows repayment rates default rates and losses assuming default discount rates and realizable collateral values the allowance for credit losses for pcd loans is recognized within acquisition accounting the allowance for credit losses for nonpcd assets is recognized as provision for credit losses in the same reporting period as the acquisition fair value adjustments are amortized or accreted into the income statement over the estimated life of the acquired assets or assumed liabilities the purchase date valuations and any subsequent adjustments determine the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different valuation results which could have material positive or negative effects on our results of operations the carrying value of goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill judgments and uncertainties the determination of fair values is based on valuations using managements assumptions of future growth rates future attrition discount rates multiples of earnings or other relevant factors in addition we engage third party specialists to assist in the development of fair values preliminary estimates of fair values may be adjusted for a period of time subsequent to the acquisition date if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date adjustments recorded during this period are recognized in the current reporting period management uses various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities and often involves a significant degree of judgment particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular item being valued examples of such items include loans deposits identifiable intangible assets and certain other assets and liabilities effect if actual results differ from assumptions changes in these factors as well as downturns in economic or business conditions could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of assets including goodwill and liabilities which could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill resides pandemic a prolonged covid19 pandemic or any other epidemic that harms the global economy us economy or the economies in which we operate could adversely affect our operations goodwill is especially susceptible to risk of impairment during prolonged periods of economic downturn for
