in the following table the taxable equivalent adjustment to net interest income and net interest margin recognizes the income tax savings when comparing taxable and taxexempt assets interest income

adequacy metrics that may be meaningful to the company as well as analysts and investors in assessing the companys use of equity and in facilitating comparisons with peers these nongaap measures are valuable indicators of a financial institutions capital strength since they eliminate intangible assets from shareholders equity and retain the effect of aoci in shareholders equity although intended to enhance investors understanding of the companys business and performance these nongaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to gaap in addition these nongaap financial measures may differ from those used by other financial institutions to assess their business and performance see the previously provided tables and the following reconciliations in the nongaap

revenues for the nine months ended september net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by many factors primarily the volume and mix of earning assets funding sources and interest rate fluctuations other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans prepayment risk on mortgage and investmentrelated assets and the composition and maturity of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities interest rates increased during the third quarter of the federal reserves federal funds rate is currently in a target range of to with the effective federal funds rate increasing basis points from june to at september management actively takes balance sheet restructuring derivative and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate interest rate risk see the section of this item titled market risk for additional information regarding this risk loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources factors such as general economic activity federal reserve monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize our mix of assets and funding net interest income and net interest margin net interest income is the excess of interest received from interestearning assets over interest paid on interestbearing liabilities for analytical purposes net interest income is presented in the table that follows adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our taxexempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same aftertax yield as a taxable asset we used the current federal statutory tax rate in effect of for all periods this

completion of a solar project within the reporting period many factors including weather labor availability building regulations inspections and other unexpected construction delays related to a rehabilitation project can cause a project to exceed its estimated completion date see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our tax credit investments fdic special assessment proposed rule on may the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic released a proposed rule that would impose special assessments to recover the losses to the deposit insurance fund dif resulting from the fdics use in march of the systemic risk exception to the leastcost resolution test under the federal deposit insurance act in connection with the receiverships of silicon valley bank and signature bank the fdic stated that it currently estimates those assessed losses to total billion and that the amount of the special assessments would be adjusted as the loss estimate changes under the proposed rule the assessment base would be an insured depository institutions idi estimated uninsured deposits as reported in the idis december call report excluding the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits the special assessments would be collected at an annual rate of approximately basis points per year basis points per quarter over eight quarters in and with the first assessment period beginning january with the first assessment payment due by june under the proposed rule the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination would be periodically adjusted and the fdic would retain the ability to cease collection early extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a onetime basis in its december call report old national bank reported estimated uninsured deposits of approximately billion old national expects the special assessments would be tax deductible although the proposal could be changed and the timing of accounting recognition is still under consideration if the assessments as proposed were recorded as an expense in a single quarter the estimated million expense would significantly affect noninterest expense and results of operations for that quarter provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes the major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on taxexempt securities and loans the effective tax rate was for the three months ended september compared to for the same period in the effective tax rate was for the nine months ended september compared to for the same period in reflecting an increase in pretax book income combined with smaller increases in taxexempt income and tax credits other contributing factors were increases in nondeductible officer compensation and nondeductible fdic premiums as well as the first midwest merger in february see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in accordance with asc accounting for interim reporting the provision for income taxes was recorded at september based on the current estimate of the effective annual rate financial condition overview at september our assets were billion a

portfolio had net unrealized losses of billion at september compared to net unrealized losses of million at december the investment securities heldtomaturity portfolio had net unrealized losses of

of at september compared to at december effective duration represents the percentage change in the fair value of the portfolio in response to a change in interest rates and is used to evaluate the

the three and nine months ended september included a million chargeoff related to a single commercial credit that is not representative of broader credit concerns management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of nonperforming loans and may consider the possibility of sales of troubled and nonperforming loans which could result in additional chargeoffs to the allowance for credit losses on loans credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses on loans the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the companys loans held for investment portfolio credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses expected credit loss inherent in noncancelable offbalancesheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the balance sheet the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments is adjusted by a credit loss expense which is reported in earnings and reduced by the chargeoff of loan amounts net of recoveries accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses the allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio segments these segments are further disaggregated into loan classes based on the level at which credit risk of the loan is monitored when computing the level of expected credit losses credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods the allowance level is influenced by loan volumes loan aqr migration or delinquency status changes in historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions the methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses on loans has two basic components first an assetspecific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans and second a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics the allowance for credit losses on loans was million at september compared to million at december continued loan growth in future periods a decline in our current level of recoveries or an increase in chargeoffs could result in an increase in provision expense additionally provision expense may be volatile due to changes in cecl model assumptions of credit quality macroeconomic factors and conditions and loan composition which drive the allowance for credit losses balance we maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements the allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet within accrued expenses and other liabilities while the corresponding provision for unfunded loan commitments is included in the provision for credit losses the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments totaled million at september compared to million at december see the section entitled risk factors in the companys annual report on form 10k for further discussion of our credit risk market risk market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets liabilities and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes the objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity potential cash flows sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities especially those that earn or pay interest are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates such as general economic and financial conditions client preferences historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its agencies particularly the federal reserve in managing interest rate risk we establish guidelines for asset and liability management including measurement of short and longterm sensitivities to changes in interest rates which are reviewed with the enterprise risk committee of our board of directors based on the results of our analysis we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities changing product pricing strategies modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio or using derivative financial instruments to a limited degree a key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the likely impact of changing interest rates on old nationals results of operations the model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario the base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels the model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions the following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a twoyear cumulative horizon based on the assetliability model at september and immediate rate decrease immediate rate increase dollars in thousands basis points basis points basis points base basis points basis points

projected interest income money market other interest earning investments and investment securities loans total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base our projected net interest income increased year over year due to loan growth and rising interest rates a key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the repricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts which have no contractual maturity dates because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results for this reason we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes including shocks ramps yield curve flattening yield curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested we use cash flow and fair value hedges primarily interest rate swaps collars and floors to mitigate interest rate risk derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value loss of million and million at september and december respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources we establish liquidity risk guidelines that we review with the enterprise risk committee of our board of directors and monitor through our assetliability executive management committee the objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and costeffective manner management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts we maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements on may we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds however deposit flows calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgagerelated securities are not as predictable as they are strongly influenced by interest rates the housing market general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace we continually monitor marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments a maturity schedule for old national banks time deposits is shown in the following table at september  in thousands

bank to old national bancorp on an unconsolidated basis without obtaining prior regulatory approval prior regulatory approval is required if dividends to be declared in any year would exceed net earnings of the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years prior regulatory approval to pay dividends was not required in and is not currently required critical accounting estimates our most significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december certain of these accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities we consider these policies to be our critical accounting estimates the judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience future forecasts or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions actual results could differ from estimates which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding critical accounting estimates see the section titled critical accounting estimates included in item of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december there have been no material changes in the companys application of critical accounting estimates since december
