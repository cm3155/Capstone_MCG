these nongaap measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be represented by other companies executive summary as part of our strategic plan the onb way we have executed most of our expense initiatives and realized the savings we previously disclosed now we transition to our revenue initiatives which were delayed due to covid19 this transition will include talent additions in key revenue positions in the commercial and wealth businesses as well as our technology team to support revenue enabling technology investments old national remains steadfast in executing the basic banking fundamentals of loan growth increases in noninterest income prudent capital deployment and expense management during the third quarter of we recorded a provision expense for loan losses of zero this provision expense was derived from the moodys baseline forecast which included meaningful improvements in both gross domestic product growth and unemployment trends when compared to the forecast used in the prior quarter during the third quarter of net income was million or per diluted share net income was million or per diluted share for the third quarter of we have continued to remix our earning assets towards more productive commercial and commercial real estate loans and out of indirect and other loans loans our loan balances excluding loans held for sale increased million to billion at september compared to billion at june this was primarily driven by growth in commercial real estate loans we reported strong total commercial loan production of million in the third quarter of and the commercial loan pipeline totaled billion at september net interest income for the nine months ended september compared to the nine months ended september our net interest income decreased primarily due to decreased loan yields partially offset by higher average loans and lower costs of interestbearing liabilities net interest income was unchanged in the third quarter of compared to the second quarter of noninterest income noninterest income increased to million in the nine months ended september compared to the nine months ended september primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenue higher capital markets income and higher debt securities gains these increases were partially offset by lower service charges on deposit accounts the third quarter of compared to the second quarter of showed an increase of million reflecting higher debt securities gains service charges on deposit accounts and mortgage banking revenue expenses noninterest expenses increased million in the nine months ended september compared to the nine months ended september the increase was primarily attributable to million of charges related to the onb way the third quarter of compared to the second quarter of showed a slight increase of million pandemic update as previously disclosed the novel strain of coronavirus covid19 which was first reported in wuhan china had an impact on our operations as of september this impact is still being addressed by old national as evidenced by our practice of occupying only of our office buildings by rotating team members every weeks however our branch lobbies are still open for business and we continue to lend to qualified businesses for working capital and general business purposes while we remain committed and focused on the health and safety of our team members clients and communities w e will continue to evaluate and adjust our branch hours lobby usage and return to work efforts as necessary depending on the path of the virus across our footprint we believe our historically strong underwriting practices diverse and granular portfolios and midwestbased footprint will help to mitigate any adverse impact to old national the impact from the virus on the companys business financial condition results of operations and its customers is still unknown the fiscal stimulus and relief programs appear to have mitigated any materially adverse financial impact to old national during the third quarter of however as a result of the covid19 pandemic any future changes in the behavior of customers businesses employees additional stimulus and relief programs as well as the availability and effectiveness of an immunization may have a future financial impact on old national results of operations the

efficiency ratio tier leverage ratio net chargeoffs recoveries to average loans beginning january calculation is based on current expected loss methodology prior to january calculation is based on incurred loss methodology represents a nongaap financial measure refer to nongaap financial measures section for reconciliations to gaap financial measures net interest income net interest income is the most significant component of our earnings comprising of revenues for the nine months ended september net interest income and margin are influenced by many factors primarily the volume and mix of earning assets funding sources and interest rate fluctuations other factors include the level of accretion income on purchased loans prepayment risk on mortgage and investmentrelated assets and the composition and maturity of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities the current uptick in cases of covid19 may offset the recent positive economic momentum and government stimulus programs accordingly there is still much uncertainty regarding the economy interest rates remained at near historic lows during the third quarter of after declining dramatically in the first half of due to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserves federal funds range is currently to with the effective fed funds rate in the to range if interest rates decline further our interest rate spread could decline which may result in a decrease in our net interest income however management has taken balance sheet restructuring derivative and deposit pricing actions to help mitigate this risk loans typically generate more interest income than investment securities with similar maturities funding from client deposits generally costs less than wholesale funding sources factors such as general economic activity federal reserve monetary policy and price volatility of competing alternative investments can also exert significant influence on our ability to optimize the mix of assets and funding net interest income and margin net interest income is the excess of interest received from earning assets over interest paid on interestbearing liabilities for analytical purposes net interest income is also presented in the table that follows adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to reflect what our taxexempt assets would need to yield in order to achieve the same aftertax yield as a taxable asset we used the federal statutory tax rate in effect of for all periods this analysis portrays the income tax benefits related to taxexempt assets and helps to facilitate a comparison between taxable and taxexempt assets management believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis therefore management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons three months ended september nine months ended september  in thousands net interest income conversion to fully taxable equivalent net interest income taxable equivalent basis average earning assets net interest margin net interest margin taxable equivalent basis the decrease in net interest income for the three and nine months ended september when compared to the three and nine months ended september was primarily due to lower yields on average earning assets and lower accretion income partially offsetting these decreases were higher average earning assets and lower costs of average interestbearing liabilities in the three and nine months ended september when compared to the three and nine months ended september net interest income for the three and nine months ended september and included accretion income interest income in excess of contractual interest income associated with acquired loans accretion income totaled million in the three months ended september and million in the nine months ended september compared to million in the three months ended september and million in the nine months ended september we expect accretion income on loans to decrease over time but this may be offset by future acquisitions the following

adjustments of million and million respectively during the three months ended september and million and million respectively during the nine months ended september using the federal statutory rate in effect of the decrease in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in was primarily due to lower yields on interest earning assets and a change in the mix of average interest earning assets and interestbearing liabilities partially offset by higher average earning assets and lower costs of interestbearing liabilities the yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points and the cost of interestbearing liabilities decreased basis points in the quarterly yearoveryear comparison the yield on interest earning assets is calculated by dividing annualized taxable equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets while the cost of interestbearing liabilities is calculated by dividing annualized interest expense by average interestbearing liabilities the yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points and the cost of interestbearing liabilities decreased basis points in the nine months ended september when compared to the nine months ended september accretion income represented basis points of the net interest margin for the three months ended september compared to basis points for the three months ended september accretion income represented basis points of the net interest margin for the nine months ended september compared to basis points for the nine months ended september the current uptick in cases of covid19 may offset the recent positive economic momentum and government stimulus programs and could negatively impact net interest margin accordingly there is still much uncertainty regarding the economy average earning assets were billion for the three months ended september compared to billion for the three months ended september an increase of billion or average earning assets were billion for the nine months ended september compared to billion for the nine months ended september an increase of billion or the increases in average earning assets were due to increases in average loans and average investment securities the loan portfolio including loans held for sale which generally has an average yield higher than the investment portfolio was of average interest earning assets for both the nine months ended september and the nine months ended september average loans including loans held for sale increased billion for the three months ended september and billion for the nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in due to increases in average commercial loans commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans partially offset by lower average consumer loans the increases in average commercial loans reflected strong ppp loan production which began in april as of september ppp loans totaled billion average investments increased million for the three months ended september and million for the nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in reflecting higher fair values and excess liquidity average noninterestbearing deposits increased billion for the three months ended september and million for the nine months ended september when

ended september compared to million for the nine months ended september net chargeoffs totaled million during the nine months ended september compared to net chargeoffs of million during the nine months ended september the provision for loan losses of zero in the three months ended september reflected the improved economic forecast and net recoveries of million during the quarter the higher provision for loan losses in the nine months ended september when compared to the nine months ended september was driven by implementation of cecl which uses an economic forecast that now includes the impact of the coronavirus pandemic ppp loans were factored in the provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended september however due to the sba guaranty and our borrowers adherence to the ppp terms the provision impact was insignificant continued loan growth in future periods a decline in our current level of recoveries or an increase in chargeoffs could result in an increase in provision expense additionally with the adoption of cecl beginning on january provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in cecl model assumptions of credit quality macroeconomic factors and conditions and loan composition which drive the allowance for credit losses balance noninterest income we generate revenues in the form of noninterest income through client fees sales

successful completion of the rehabilitation of a historic building or completion of a solar project within the reporting period many factors including weather labor availability building regulations inspections and other unexpected construction delays related to a rehabilitation project can cause a project to exceed its estimated completion date see note to the consolidated financial statements

termination charges and impairments on longlived assets related to branch consolidations that were part of the onb way strategic initiative totaling million in the nine months ended september provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes currently payable and for income taxes payable or benefits to be received in the future which arise due to timing differences in the recognition of certain items for financial statement and income tax purposes the major difference between the effective tax rate applied to our financial statement income and the federal statutory tax rate is caused by a tax benefit from our tax credit investments and interest on taxexempt securities and loans the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was for the three months ended september compared to for the three months ended september the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was for the nine months ended september compared to for the nine months ended september in accordance with asc accounting for interim reporting the provision for income taxes was recorded at september based on the current estimate of the effective annual rate the lower effective tax rate during the three and nine months ended september when compared to the same periods in was primarily the result of an increase in federal tax credits available see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information financial condition overview at september our assets were billion a billion increase compared to assets of billion at december the increase was primarily due to higher commercial loans driven by strong ppp loan production in the second quarter of as of september ppp loans totaled billion the current uptick in cases of covid19 may offset the recent positive economic momentum and government stimulus programs and could negatively impact our financial condition accordingly there is still much uncertainty regarding the economy earning assets our earning assets are comprised of investment securities portfolio loans loans held for sale money market investments interest earning accounts with the federal reserve and equity securities earning assets were billion at september a billion increase compared to earning assets of billion at december investment securities we classify the majority of our investment securities as

recorded at fair value and totaled million at september compared to million at december at september the investment securities portfolio including equity securities was billion compared to billion at december an increase of million investment securities represented of earning assets at september compared to at december stronger commercial loan demand in the future could result in managements decision to reduce the securities portfolio at september management does not intend to sell any securities in an unrealized loss position and does not believe we will be required to sell such securities the investment securities availableforsale portfolio had net unrealized gains of million at september compared to net unrealized gains of million at december net unrealized gains losses increased from december to september reflecting higher net unrealized gains on mortgagebacked and tax exempt municipal securities due to a decline in longterm interest rates the investment portfolio had an effective duration of at september compared to at december effective duration measures the percentage change in value of the portfolio in response to a change in interest rates generally there is more uncertainty in interest rates over a longer average maturity resulting in a higher duration percentage the annualized average yields on investment securities on a taxable equivalent basis were

properties decisions to lend are based on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower in evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan we primarily emphasize the ratio of the propertys projected net cash flows to the loans debt service requirement the debt service coverage ratio normally is not less than and it is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses as appropriate in addition a personal guarantee of the loan or a portion thereof is often required from the principals of the borrower in most cases we require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien fire and extended coverage casualty insurance and flood insurance if appropriate in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property in addition business interruption insurance or other insurance may be required construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows derived from rental income business income from an owneroccupant or the sale of the property to an enduser we may mitigate the risks associated with these types of loans by requiring fixedprice construction contracts performance and payment bonding controlled disbursements and presale contracts or prelease agreements consumer we offer a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans to consumers within our markets with residential home mortgages comprising our largest consumer loan category these loans are secured by a primary residence and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks of the consumer decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios liquidity and credit scores a maximum ltv ratio of is generally required although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance or other mitigating factors we offer fixed rate mortgages and variable rate mortgages with interest rates that are subject to change every year after the first third fifth or seventh year depending on the product and are based on fullyindexed rates such as libor we do not offer paymentoption facilities subprime loans or any product with negative amortization home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property of the borrower the underwriting terms for the home equity product generally permit borrowing availability in the aggregate up to of the appraised value of the collateral property at the time of origination we offer fixed and variable rate home equity loans with variable rate loans underwritten at fullyindexed rates decisions are primarily based on ltv ratios dti ratios and credit scores we do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation automobile loans include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles we originate automobile loans and leases primarily on an indirect basis through selected dealerships we require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans with us listed as loss payee our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicants overall financial capacity including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan although an applicants creditworthiness is the primary consideration the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount asset quality communitybased lending personnel along with regionbased independent underwriting and analytic support staff extend credit under guidelines established and administered by our enterprise risk committee this committee which meets quarterly is made up of outside directors the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies credit exposures peer comparisons problem loans and chargeoffs in addition the committee reviews and approves recommended loan policy changes to assure it remains appropriate for the current lending environment we lend to commercial and commercial real estate clients in various industries including manufacturing agribusiness transportation mining wholesaling and retailing old national manages concentrations of credit exposure by industry product geography customer relationship and loan size at september our average commercial loan size excluding ppp loans was under and our average commercial real estate loan size was under in addition while loans to lessors of both residential and nonresidential real estate exceed of total loans no individual subsegment category within those broader categories reaches the threshold at september we had minimal exposure to foreign borrowers and no sovereign debt our policy is to concentrate our lending activity in the geographic market areas we serve primarily indiana kentucky michigan wisconsin and minnesota we have experienced an impact from covid19 as of september however the depth of this crisis is ongoing and its effect is anticipated to be very broadbased we are seeing another uptick in covid19 cases in our geographic footprint the relief programs we have put in place along with governmental stimulus programs have helped dampen any increases in delinquencies we might have seen absent these programs it remains to be seen what impact any wind down of these programs will have on delinquency rates going forward management believes that trends in underperforming criticized and classified loans will be influenced by the degree to which the economy strengthens or weakens as well as the ongoing impact of the

include investment securities that fell below investment grade rating totaling million at september compared to million at september and million at december old national may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans the decision to restructure a loan versus aggressively enforcing the collection of the loan may benefit old national by increasing the ultimate probability of collection any loans that are modified are reviewed by old national to identify if a tdr has occurred which is when for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties old national bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status the modification of the terms of such loans include one or a combination of the following a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan an extension of the maturity date at a stated rate of interest lower than the current market rate of new debt with similar risk or a permanent reduction of the recorded investment of the loan loans modified in a tdr are typically placed on nonaccrual status until we determine the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms for six months if we are unable to resolve a nonperforming loan issue the credit will be charged off when it is apparent there will be a loss for large commercial type loans each relationship is individually analyzed for evidence of apparent loss based on quantitative benchmarks or subjectively based upon certain events or particular circumstances generally old national charges off small commercial loans scored through our small business credit center with contractual balances under that are days or more delinquent and do not have adequate collateral support for residential and consumer loans a charge off is recorded at the time foreclosure is initiated or when the loan becomes to days past due whichever is earlier for commercial tdrs an allocated reserve is established within the allowance for credit losses for the difference between the carrying value of the loan and its computed value to determine the computed value of the loan one of the following methods is selected the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate the loans observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent the allocated reserve is established as the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the collectable value if there are significant changes in the amount or timing of the loans expected future cash flows impairment is recalculated and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly when a residential or consumer loan is identified as a tdr the loan is typically written down to its collateral value less selling costs at september tdrs consisted of million of commercial loans million of commercial real estate loans million of bbcc loans million of residential real estate loans million of direct consumer loans and million of home equity loans totaling million tdrs included within nonaccrual loans totaled million at september at december tdrs consisted of

totaling million tdrs included within nonaccrual loans totaled million at december old national has allocated specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified as tdrs totaling million at september and million of december at september old national had committed to lend an additional million to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as tdrs compared to million at december the terms of certain other loans were modified during and that did not meet the definition of a tdr it is our process to review all classified and criticized loans that during the period have been renewed have entered into a forbearance agreement have gone from principal and interest to interest only or have extended the maturity date in order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification the evaluation is performed under our internal underwriting policy we also evaluate whether a concession has been granted or if we were adequately compensated through a market interest rate additional collateral or a bona fide guarantee we also consider whether the modification was insignificant relative to the other terms of the agreement or the delay in a payment in general once a modified loan is considered a tdr the loan will always be considered a tdr and therefore impaired until it is paid in full otherwise settled sold or charged off however guidance also permits for loans to be removed from tdr status when subsequently restructured under these circumstances at the time of the subsequent restructuring the borrower is not experiencing financial difficulties and this is documented by a current credit evaluation at the time of the restructuring under the terms of the subsequent restructuring agreement the institution has granted no concession to the borrower and the subsequent restructuring agreement includes market terms that are no less favorable than those that would be offered for a comparable new loan for loans subsequently restructured that have cumulative principal forgiveness the loan should continue to be measured in accordance with asc receivables overall however consistent with asc troubled debt restructurings by creditors creditor disclosure of troubled debt restructurings the loan would not be required to be reported in the years following the restructuring if the subsequent restructuring meets both of these criteria has an interest rate at the time of the subsequent restructuring that is not less than a market interest rate and is performing in compliance with its modified terms after the subsequent restructuring we have developed relief programs to assist borrowers in financial need due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic the interagency statement issued by our banking regulators encourages financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of covid19 additionally section of the cares act further provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law from classification as a tdr as defined by gaap from the period beginning march until the earlier of december or the date that is days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the covid19 outbreak declared by the president of the united states under the national emergencies act usc et seq terminates the interagency statement was subsequently revised in april to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with section of the cares act as well as setting forth the banking regulators views on consumer protection considerations in accordance with such guidance we are offering shortterm modifications made in response to covid19 to borrowers who are current and otherwise not past due these include shortterm days or less modifications in the form of payment deferrals fee waivers extensions of repayment terms or other delays in payment that are insignificant the table below presents loan deferrals by loan category dollars in thousands june deferrals balance september deferrals balance september number of deferrals commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate consumer total includes second deferrals between and days totaling million of commercial and commercial real estate loans million of residential real estate loans and million of consumer loans us small business administration paycheck protection program section of the cares act created the ppp a program administered by the sba to provide loans to small businesses for payroll and other basic expenses during the covid19 pandemic old national has participated in the ppp as a lender these loans are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the sba additionally loan payments will also be deferred for the first six months of the loan term the ppp commenced on april and was available to qualified borrowers through august no collateral or personal guarantees are required neither the government nor lenders are permitted to charge the recipients any fees old national began accepting applications from qualified borrowers on april and as of september has originated over loans with balances in excess of billion to new and existing clients through the ppp to the extent the ppp loans are forgiven this represents outside equity contributions to our borrowers and especially with respect to vulnerable industries we believe these capital injections are going to be instrumental in assisting our borrowers in navigating through the pandemic this capital injection along with the level of capital each borrower had just prior to covid19 impacting them are critical factors in determining the staying power of our borrowers upon receipt of interim financial results from our borrowers we will use that information to update our understanding of the underlying strengths or weaknesses in each individual relationship and take actions as appropriate the sba recently announced a streamlined forgiveness process for loans of or less as of october of our loans totaling million have been submitted to the sba for forgiveness allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments loan chargeoffs net of recoveries totaled million of net recoveries for the three months ended september compared to million of net chargeoffs for the three months ended september

net chargeoffs for the nine months ended september compared to million of net chargeoffs for the nine months ended september annualized net chargeoffs recoveries to average loans were for the nine months ended september compared to for the nine months ended september management will continue its efforts to reduce the level of nonperforming loans and may consider the possibility of sales of troubled and nonperforming loans which could result in additional chargeoffs to the allowance for credit losses on loans beginning january we calculated allowance for credit losses using current expected credit losses methodology as of january old national increased the allowance for credit losses for loans by million and increased the allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments by million since the asu covers credit losses over the expected life of a loan as well as considering future changes in macroeconomic conditions the increase related to the acquired loan portfolio totaled million credit quality within the loans held for investment portfolio is continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent within the companys loans held for investment portfolio credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process for estimating expected credit losses expected credit loss inherent in noncancelable offbalancesheet credit exposures is accounted for as a separate liability included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition the allowance for credit losses for loans held for investment is adjusted by a credit loss expense which is reported in earnings and reduced by the chargeoff of loan amounts net of recoveries accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses the allowance for credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of its loan portfolio segments these segments are further disaggregated into loan classes the level at which credit risk is monitored when computing the level of expected credit losses credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods the allowance level is influenced by loan volumes loan aqr migration or delinquency status changes in historical loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions the methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the allowance for credit losses has two basic components first an assetspecific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans and second a pooled component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics at september the allowance for credit losses for loans was million continued loan growth in future periods a decline in our current level of recoveries or an increase in chargeoffs could result in an increase in provision expense additionally with the adoption of cecl beginning on january provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in cecl model assumptions of credit quality macroeconomic factors and conditions and loan composition which drive the allowance for credit losses balance prior to january we calculated allowance for loan losses using incurred losses methodology at december the allowance for loan losses was million we maintain an allowance for credit losses on unfunded commercial lending commitments and letters of credit to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements the allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for credit losses for loans modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet and totaled million at september prior to january we calculated allowance for losses on unfunded loan commitments using incurred losses methodology at december the allowance losses on unfunded commitments was million market risk market risk is the risk that the estimated fair value of our assets liabilities and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes the objective of our interest rate management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity potential cash flows sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities especially those that earn or pay interest are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates such as general economic and financial conditions customer preferences historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments our earnings can also be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us government and its agencies particularly the federal reserve in managing interest rate risk we through the funds management committee a committee of the board of directors establish guidelines for asset and liability management including measurement of short and longterm sensitivities to changes in interest rates based on the results of our analysis we may use different techniques to manage changing trends in interest rates including adjusting balance sheet mix or altering interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities changing product pricing strategies modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio or using derivative financial instruments to a limited degree a key element in our ongoing process is to measure and monitor interest rate risk using a model to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on old national the model quantifies the effects of various possible interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario the base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are held at current levels interest rates are floored at in the down basis points scenario the model shows our projected net interest income sensitivity based on interest rate changes only and does not consider other forecast assumptions the following table illustrates our projected net interest income sensitivity over a two year cumulative horizon based on the assetliability model at september and immediate rate decrease immediate rate increase dollars in thousands basis points base basis points basis points basis points september projected interest income money market other interest earning investments and investment securities loans total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base september projected interest income money market other interest earning investments and investment securities loans total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowings total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base our asset sensitivity increased year over year primarily due to deposit pricing actions and changes in our hedging strategies balance sheet mix investment duration and prepayment speed behavior a key element in the measurement and modeling of interest rate risk is the repricing assumptions of our transaction deposit accounts which have no contractual maturity dates because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect our net interest income we recognize that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results for this reason we model many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to understand our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes including shocks ramps yield curve flattening yield curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rate scenarios tested at september our projected net interest income sensitivity based on the assetliability models we utilize was within the limits of our interest rate risk policy for the scenarios tested we use cash flow and fair value hedges primarily interest rate swaps collars and floors to mitigate interest rate risk derivatives designated as hedging instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value of million at september compared to a net asset position with a fair value of million at december see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments liquidity risk liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources the funds management committee of the board of directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and along with the balance sheet management committee monitors liquidity risk the objective of liquidity management is to ensure we have the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and costeffective manner management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts we maintain strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements on june we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec that permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds however deposit flows calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgagerelated securities are strongly influenced by interest rates the

critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december certain accounting policies require management to use significant judgment and estimates which can have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities we consider these policies to be critical accounting policies the judgment and assumptions made are based upon historical experience or other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances because of the nature of the judgment and assumptions actual results could differ from estimates which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant judgments and estimates management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee goodwill description for acquisitions we are required to record the assets acquired including identified intangible assets and the liabilities assumed at their fair value these often involve estimates based on third party valuations such as appraisals or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition inflation asset growth rates or other relevant factors goodwill recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill judgments and uncertainties the determination of fair values is based on valuations using managements assumptions of future growth rates future attrition discount rates multiples of earnings or other relevant factors effect if actual results differ from assumptions changes in these factors as well as downturns in economic or business conditions could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying value of goodwill and could result in impairment losses affecting our financial statements as a whole and our banking subsidiary in which the goodwill resides pandemic a prolonged covid19 outbreak or any other epidemic that harms the global economy us economy or the economies in which we operate could adversely affect our operations based on the required annual impairment test as of august we have concluded that our goodwill was not impaired on a quarterly basis we continue to evaluate our qualitative assessment assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties including forecasted revenues expenses and cash flows current discount rates our market capitalization observable market transactions and multiples changes to the regulatory environment and the nature and amount of government support that has been and is expected to be provided in the future a prolonged economic downturn or deterioration in the economic outlook may lead management to conclude that an interim quantitative impairment test of our goodwill is required prior to the annual impairment test conducted on august allowance for credit losses for loans description the allowance for credit losses for loans represents managements estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain subsequent evaluations of the thenexisting loan portfolio in light of the factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods the allowance for credit losses for loans as reported in our consolidated statements of financial condition is adjusted by an expense for credit losses which is recognized in earnings and reduced by the chargeoff of loan amounts net of recoveries judgments and uncertainties we utilize a discounted cashflow approach to determine the allowance for credit losses for performing loans and nonperforming loans expected cashflows are created for each loan and discounted using the effective yield the discounted sum of expected cashflows is then compared to the amortized cost and any shortfall is recorded as reserve expected cashflows are created using a combination of contractual payment schedules calculated pds lgd and prepayment assumptions as well as qualitative factors for the commercial and commercial real estate loans the pd is forecast using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan moving into nonaccrual within the time horizon for residential and consumer loans the pd is forecast using a regression model to determine the likelihood of a loan being chargedoff within the time horizon the regression models use combinations of variables to assess systematic and unsystematic risk variables used for unsystematic risk are borrower specific and help to gauge the risk of default from an individual borrower variables for systematic risk risk inherent to all borrowers come from the use of forwardlooking economic forecasts and include variables such as unemployment rate gross domestic product and house price index the lgd is defined as credit loss incurred when an obligor of the bank defaults qualitative factors include items such as changes in lending policies or procedures and economic uncertainty in forwardlooking forecasts effect if actual results differ from assumptions the allowance represents managements best estimate but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance likewise an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance in either instance unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations the expense for credit loss recorded through earnings is the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the amount of expected credit losses inherent within the loans held for investment portfolio the amount of expense and the corresponding level of allowance for credit losses for loans are based on our evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience reasonable and supportable forecasts and other significant qualitative and quantitative factors derivative financial instruments description as part of our overall interest rate risk management we use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements all of the derivative financial instruments we use have an active market and indications of fair value can be readily obtained we are not using the shortcut method of accounting for any fair value derivatives judgments and uncertainties the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items effect if actual results differ from assumptions to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective changes in fair value of the derivatives are offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income however if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by us no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment all changes in fair value of the derivative would flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income resulting in greater volatility in our earnings income taxes description we are subject to the income tax laws of the us its states and the municipalities in which we operate these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities we review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly and as new information becomes available the balances are adjusted as appropriate fasb asc fin prescribes a recognition threshold of morelikelythannot and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our provision and related income tax assets and liabilities judgments and uncertainties in establishing a provision for income tax expense we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws we must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to reviewadjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the judgments and estimates used are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement would result in a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
