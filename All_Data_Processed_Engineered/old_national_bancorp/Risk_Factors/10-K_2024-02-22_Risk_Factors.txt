item risk factors there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect old nationals business financial condition results of operations or cash flows and access to liquidity thereby affecting an investment in our common stock strategic financial and reputational risks economic conditions have affected and could continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits old nationals financial performance generally and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans as well as demand for loans and other products and services that old national offers is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where old national operates and in the united states as a whole a favorable business environment is generally characterized by among other factors economic growth efficient capital markets low inflation low unemployment high business and investor confidence and strong business earnings unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth business activity or investor or business confidence limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital increases in inflation or interest rates high unemployment natural disasters the severity and frequency of which are increasing as a result of climate change terrorist acts or a combination of these or other factors an economic downturn sustained high unemployment levels stock market volatility andor high levels of inflation have in the past negatively affected and in the future may negatively affect our operating results and have had or may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans increasing the risk of loan defaults and losses if the forecasts of economic conditions and other economic predictions are not accurate we may face challenges in accurately estimating the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans expectations of negative market and economic conditions will be reflected in the allowances for credit losses for loans and debt securities to the estimated extent they will impact the credit losses of loans and debt securities over their remaining lives the provision for credit losses will report the entire increased credit loss expectations over the remaining lives of the loans and debt securities in the period in which the change in expectation arises further because of the impact of such increased credit losses on earnings and capital our ability to make loans and pay dividends may be substantially diminished changes in economic or political conditions have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect old nationals earnings if the ability of old nationals borrowers to repay loans or the value of the collateral securing such loans declines old nationals success depends to a certain extent upon economic or political conditions local and national as well as governmental monetary policies conditions such as recession unemployment changes in interest rates inflation money supply and other factors beyond old nationals control have in the past adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect old nationals asset quality deposit levels and loan demand and therefore old nationals earnings because old national has a significant amount of commercial real estate loans decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of old nationals borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans which would have an adverse impact on old nationals earnings supply chain constraints robust demand and labor shortages have led to persistent inflationary pressures throughout the economy volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and its effects which could potentially contribute to poor economic conditions may enhance some of the risks described in this section for example higher inflation could reduce demand for our products adversely affect the creditworthiness of our borrowers or result in lower values for our interestearning assets and investment securities any of these effects or others that we are not able to predict could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations economic conditions financial markets and inflationary pressures may be adversely affected by the impact of current or anticipated geopolitical uncertainties global military conflicts pandemics and global national and local responses to such events by governmental authorities and other third parties these unpredictable events could create increase or prolong economic and financial disruptions and volatility that adversely affect the companys business financial condition capital and results of operations federal budget deficit concerns and the potential for political conflict over legislation to fund us government operations and raise the us governments debt limit may increase the possibility of a default by the us government on its debt obligations related creditrating downgrades or an economic recession in the united states many of our investment securities are issued by the us government and government agencies and sponsored entities as a result of uncertain domestic political conditions including potential future federal government shutdowns the possibility of the federal government defaulting on its obligations for a period of time due to debt ceiling limitations or other unresolved political issues investments in financial instruments issued or guaranteed by the federal government pose liquidity risks in connection with prior political disputes over us fiscal and budgetary issues leading to the us government shutdown in sp lowered its longterm sovereign credit rating on the us from aaa to aa a further downgrade or a downgrade by other rating agencies as well as sovereign debt issues facing the governments of other countries could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the us and worldwide old nationals regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in the locations in which old national operates substantially all of old nationals loans are to individuals and businesses in old nationals market areas in the midwest region therefore the company is or in the future may be particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the midwest region the credit quality of the companys borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside the companys control including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuations the trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality particularly in the midwest region have caused and in the future may cause the company to experience impairment charges which are reductions in the recoverable value of an asset increased purchase demands wherein customers make withdrawals with minimum notice higher costs eg servicing foreclosure property maintenance additional writedowns and losses and a potential impact to engage in lending transactions based on a reduction of customer deposits which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations mergers and acquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties and dilution to existing shareholder value we have acquired and expect to continue to acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions and other businesses related to banking in the future and we may engage in de novo banking center expansion we may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services we may incur substantial costs to expand and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek or expect there can be no assurance that integration efforts for any mergers or acquisitions will be successful or that after giving effect to the merger or acquisition we will achieve profits comparable to or better than our historical experience we have issued and may in the future issue equity securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions which have caused and could in the future cause additional ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders in addition mergers and acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of the companys tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction acquisitions and mergers involve a number of other expenses and risks including the time and costs associated with identifying potential new markets as well as acquisition and merger targets the accuracy of the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit operations management and market risks with respect to the target institution the time and costs of evaluating entry into new markets where we lack experience hiring experienced local management opening new offices and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion our ability to finance an acquisition or merger and possible dilution to our existing shareholders the diversion of our managements attention to the negotiation and execution of a transaction and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combined businesses the introduction of new products and services into our business the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets associated with an acquisition or merger and possible adverse shortterm effects on our results of operations closing delays and increased expenses related to the resolution of lawsuits filed by shareholders of target institutions and the risk of loss of key employees and clients furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence or other projected benefits from an acquisition or merger could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations mergers and acquisitions may be delayed impeded or prohibited due to regulatory issues mergers and acquisitions by financial institutions including by the company are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies the process for obtaining these required regulatory approvals is complex and involves a comprehensive application review process regulatory approvals could be delayed impeded restrictively conditioned or denied should the company have regulatory issues with regulatory agencies including without limitation issues related to bsa compliance cra issues fair lending laws fair housing laws consumer protection laws unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations and other laws and regulations over the past several years mergers of banking organizations have encountered greater regulatory governmental and community scrutiny and have taken substantially longer to receive the necessary regulatory approvals and other required governmental clearances than in the past the company may fail to pursue evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant merger and acquisition opportunities as a result of its inability or perceived or anticipated inability to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner under reasonable conditions or at all difficulties associated with potential mergers and acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models the processes that we use to estimate expected credit losses and to measure the fair value of assets carried on the balance sheet at fair value as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models these models are complex and reflect assumptions that may not be accurate particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances and require us to make judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain different assumptions could have resulted in significant changes in valuation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations old national operates in an extremely competitive market and old nationals business will suffer if old national is unable to compete effectively in our market area old national encounters significant competition from other commercial banks savings and loan associations credit unions mortgage banking firms fintech companies consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market mutual funds and other financial services companies our competitors may have substantially greater resources and lending limits than old national does and may offer services that old national does not or cannot provide some of our nonfinancial institution competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints broader geographic service areas and in some cases lower cost structures and as a result may be able to compete more effectively for business in particular the activity of marketplace lenders and other fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow fintechs have and may continue to offer bank or banklike products for example a number of fintechs have applied for and in some cases received bank or industrial loan charters in addition other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers regulatory changes may also make it easier for fintechs to partner with banks and offer deposit products our ability to originate residential mortgage loans has also been adversely affected by the increased competition resulting from the unprecedented involvement of the us government and governmentsponsored entities in the residential mortgage market other recent regulation has reduced the regulatory burden of large bank holding companies and raised the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply which could cause certain large bank holding companies with less than billion in total consolidated assets which were previously subject to more stringent enhanced prudential standards to become more competitive or to pursue expansion more aggressively there is also increased competition by outofmarket competitors through online and mobile channels in addition the emergence adoption and evolution of new technologies that do not require intermediation including distributed ledgers as well as advances in automation could significantly affect competition for financial services old nationals profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area our business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain skilled people our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best employees in most of the activities we engage in can be intense we may not be able to hire the best people for key roles or retain them in addition the transition to increased workfromhome and hybrid work arrangements may exacerbate the challenges of attracting and retaining talented and diverse employees as job markets may be less constrained by physical geography our current or future approach to inoffice and workfromhome arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by competitors which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees the loss of any of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business we may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice old national has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to its common shareholders the payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions and safety and soundness considerations any payment of dividends in the future will depend in large part on old nationals earnings capital requirements financial condition and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors old national bancorp is an entity separate and distinct from old national bank old national bank conducts most of our operations and old national bancorp depends upon dividends from old national bank to service its debt and to pay dividends to old nationals shareholders the availability of dividends from old national bank is limited by various statutes and regulations it is possible depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of old national bank and other factors that the occ could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice in addition the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiarys state of incorporation and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries under the terms of the junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures that old national has issued to various trust preferred securities trusts old national has the right at any time during the term of the debentures to defer the payment of interest at any time or from time to time for an extension period not exceeding consecutive quarterly periods with respect to each extension period in the event that old national elects to defer interest on the debentures old national may not with certain exceptions declare or pay any dividends or distributions on its capital stock or purchase or acquire any of its capital stock under the terms of the old national preferred stock in the event that we do not declare and pay dividends on such old national preferred stock for the most recent dividend period we may not with certain exceptions declare or pay dividends on or purchase redeem or otherwise acquire shares of common stock or any other securities that rank junior to such old national preferred stock in the event that old national bank was unable to pay dividends to us we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our common stock our failure to pay dividends on our common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock see business supervision and regulation dividend limitations and note to the consolidated financial statements old national may not realize the expected benefits of its strategic imperatives old nationals ability to compete depends on a number of factors including among others its ability to develop and successfully execute strategic plans and imperatives our strategic priorities include consistent quality earnings continued management discipline strong risk management and appropriate levels of risk taking fewer operational surprises disruptions and losses improved operational effectiveness and efficiency more effective deployment of resources and increased awareness and involvement in the achievement of strategic goals our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability climate change could have a material negative impact on the company and clients the companys business as well as the operations and activities of our clients could be negatively affected by climate change climate change presents both immediate and longterm risks to the company and its clients and these risks are expected to increase over time climate change presents multifaceted risks including operational risk from the physical effects of climate events on the company and its clients facilities and other assets including the possible reduction of the value or destruction of collateral for our loans credit risk from borrowers with significant exposure to climate risk transition risks associated with the transition to a less carbondependent economy and reputational risk from stakeholder concerns about our practices related to climate change the companys carbon footprint and the companys business relationships with clients who operate in carbonintensive industries federal and state banking regulators and supervisory authorities investors and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their clients which may result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending and investment activities the leaders of the federal banking agencies including the comptroller of the currency have emphasized that climaterelated risks are faced by banking organizations of all types and sizes specifically including physical and transition risks and are in the process of enhancing supervisory expectations regarding banks risk management practices to that end in december the occ published proposed principles for climate risk management by larger banking organizations the occ also has created an office of climate risk and appointed a climate change risk officer to oversee that office and has established an internal climate risk implementation committee in order to assist with these initiatives and to support the agencys efforts to enhance its supervision of climate change risk management the occ stressed in its annual report that climaterelated financial risks pose novel challenges that national banks together with the occ are expected to meet however the occ acknowledged that its focus in this area has purposefully been directed at institutions with more than billion in total assets as risks are more complex and material at such institutions in addition on march and december respectively the fdic and the federal reserve issued their own proposed principles for climate risk management which also are applicable to larger banking organizations given that climate change could impose systemic risks upon the financial sector either via disruptions in economic activity resulting from the physical impacts of climate change or changes in policies as the economy transitions to a less carbonintensive environment the company may face regulatory risk of increasing focus on the companys resilience to climaterelated risks including in the context of stress testing for various climate stress scenarios ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory compliance credit and reputational risks and costs although we continue to make efforts to enhance our governance of climate changerelated risks and integrate climate considerations into our risk governance framework the risks associated with climate change are rapidly changing and evolving in an escalating fashion making them difficult to assess due to limited data and other uncertainties for example longterm shifts in the climate including altered distribution and intensity of rainfall rising sea levels and a rising heat index negatively affect our ability to predict the effects of natural disasters accurately in addition climate change may result in reduced availability of insurance for our borrowers including insurance that protects property pledged as collateral which could negatively affect our ability to predict credit losses accurately we could experience increased expenses resulting from strategic planning litigation and technology and market changes and reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment regulatory scrutiny and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence due to our response to climate change and our climate change strategy which in turn could have a material negative impact on our business results of operations and financial condition old national is exposed to reputational risk old nationals reputation is a key asset to its business a negative public opinion of the company and its business can result from any number of activities including the companys lending practices corporate governance and regulatory compliance mergers and acquisitions and esg matters such as among other things climate risk hiring practices the diversity of our work force and racial and social justice issues involving our personnel customers and third parties with whom we otherwise do business and actions taken by regulators community organizations investors and other stakeholders in response to these activities significant harm to the companys reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions litigation employee misconduct or the activities of customers other participants in the financial services industry or the companys contractual counterparties such as service providers and vendors a service disruption of the companys technology platforms or an impact to the companys branches could have a negative impact on a customers access to banking services and harm the companys reputation with customers in particular a cybersecurity event impacting the companys or its customers data could have a negative impact on the companys reputation and customer confidence in the company and its cybersecurity damage to the companys reputation could also adversely affect its credit ratings and access to the capital markets in addition whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation which magnifies the potential harm to the companys reputation events that result in damage to the companys reputation may also increase our litigation risk increase regulatory scrutiny of the company and its business affect our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and have other consequences that we may not be able to predict credit risk if old nationals actual credit losses for loans or debt securities exceed old nationals allowance for credit losses on loans and debt securities old nationals net income will decrease also future additions to old nationals allowance for credit losses will reduce old nationals future earnings old nationals business depends on the creditworthiness of our clients as with most financial institutions we maintain allowances for credit losses for loans and debt securities to provide for defaults and nonperformance which represent an estimate of expected losses over the remaining contractual lives of the loan and debt security portfolios this estimate is the result of our continuing evaluation of specific credit risks and loss experience current loan and debt security portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions industry concentrations reasonable and supportable forecasts for future conditions and other factors that may indicate losses the determination of the appropriate levels of the allowances for loan and debt security credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make estimates of current credit risks and future trends all of which may undergo material changes generally our nonperforming loans other real estate owned and other repossessed property reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers and weaknesses in the economies of the markets we serve the allowances may not be adequate to cover actual losses and future allowance for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties including financial statements credit reports and other financial information we may also rely on representations of those customers counterparties or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements credit reports or other financial information could cause us to enter into unfavorable transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations old nationals loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss old national bank originates commercial real estate loans commercial loans agricultural loans consumer loans and residential real estate loans primarily within old nationals market areas commercial real estate commercial consumer and agricultural loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate these loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons commercial real estate loans repayment is dependent upon income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service commercial loans repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the borrowers business consumer loans consumer loans such as personal lines of credit are collateralized if at all with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation damage or loss agricultural loans repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either old national bank or the borrowers these factors include weather input costs commodity and land prices and interest rates in addition the effects of climate change could materially enhance the credit risks related to agricultural loans in ways that we may not be able to predict in addition as described further in this risk factors section the companys credit risks may be increased by the impacts of inflation poor or recessionary economic conditions and financial market volatility growth in our commercial real estate loan portfolio over the past several years and potential future growth has resulted in and may result in further significant expense to implement risk management procedures and controls to effectively evaluate and monitor the portfolio at december commercial real estate loans including owneroccupied investor and real estate construction loans totaled billion or of our total loan portfolio commercial real estate loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrowers control for example emerging and evolving factors such as the shift to workfromhome or hybridwork arrangements changing consumer preferences including for online shopping changes in occupancy rates as a result of these and other trends have had and in the future could have a material effect on our borrowers ability to repay their loans if old national forecloses on real property collateral old national may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property resulting in reduced revenues old national may have to foreclose on collateral real property to protect old nationals investment and may thereafter own and operate such property in which case old national will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate the amount that old national as a mortgagee may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of old nationals control including but not limited to i general or local economic conditions ii neighborhood values iii size use and location of the properties iv interest rates v real estate tax rates vi operating expenses of the mortgaged properties vii environmental remediation liabilities viii ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties ix zoning laws x governmental rules regulations and fiscal policies and xi acts of god certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate principally real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs may adversely affect the income from the real estate therefore the cost of operating real property may exceed the income earned from such property and old national may have to advance funds in order to protect old nationals investment or dispose of the real property at a loss the foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect old nationals ability to generate revenues resulting in reduced levels of profitability the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect old national financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty and other relationships old national has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and old national and certain of its subsidiaries routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutions many of these transactions expose old national to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty in addition old nationals credit risk may be affected when collateral is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure these types of losses could materially adversely affect old nationals results of operations or financial condition market interest rate and liquidity risks the price of old nationals common stock may be volatile which may result in losses for investors general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of old nationals common stock in addition the following factors may cause the market price for shares of old nationals common stock to fluctuate announcements of developments related to old nationals business fluctuations in old nationals results of operations sales or purchases of substantial amounts of old nationals securities in the marketplace general conditions in old nationals banking niche or the global or national economy a shortfall or excess in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations changes in analysts recommendations or projections old nationals announcement of new mergers acquisitions or other projects and negative news about the company the banking industry generally or the financial services industry generally changes in interest rates could adversely affect old nationals results of operations and financial condition the monetary tax and other policies of governmental agencies including the federal reserve have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the company has no control and which the company may not be able to anticipate adequately the federal reserve raised benchmark interest rates throughout and and may continue to raise interest rates or not reduce rates in response to economic conditions particularly inflationary pressures old nationals earnings depend substantially on old nationals interest rate spread which is the difference between i the rates old national earns on loans securities and other earning assets and ii the interest rates old national pays on deposits and other borrowings these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond old nationals control including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities when market interest rates rise such as during and old national faces competitive pressure to increase the rates that old national pays on deposits which could result in a decrease of old nationals net interest income when market interest rates decline old national has experienced and could in the future experience fixedrate loan prepayments and higher investment portfolio cash flows resulting in a lower yield on earning assets sharp fluctuations in interest rates could exacerbate these risks old nationals earnings can also be impacted by the spread between shortterm and longterm market interest rates the monetary tax and other policies of the government and its agencies including the federal reserve have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance these governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the company an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates the actions of the federal reserve influence the rates of interest that the company charges on loans and that the company pays on borrowings and interestbearing deposits and can also affect the value of the companys onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet financial instruments also due to the impact on rates for shortterm funding the federal reserves policies influence to a significant extent the companys cost of such funding and increases in shortterm interest rates have in the past increased and may in the future increase the companys cost of shortterm funding the company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity the companys liquidity and ability to fund loan demand and operate its business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in banks or other financial intermediaries or financial markets in general which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral andor ability to access capital markets on favorable terms as we and other regional banking organizations experienced in the failure of other financial institutions may cause deposit outflows as customers spread deposits among several different banks so as to maximize their amount of fdic insurance move deposits to banks deemed too big to fail or remove deposits from the banking system entirely negative news about the company banks other financial intermediaries or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the company which could in turn materially adversely affect the companys liquidity and funding such reputational damage may result in the loss of customer deposits the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets and downgrades in one or more of the companys credit ratings and may also negatively affect the companys ability to access the capital markets a downgrade in the companys credit ratings which could result from general industrywide or regulatory factors not solely related to the company could adversely affect the companys ability to borrow funds including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect old nationals ability to raise capital many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which old national has little or no control there can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future if the company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively the companys liquidity operating margins financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected the company may also need to raise additional capital and liquidity through the issuance of stock which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders or reduce or even eliminate common stock dividends or share repurchases to preserve capital and liquidity if the company is unable to maintain or grow its deposits it may be subject to paying higher funding costs the total amount that the company pays for funding costs is dependent in part on the companys ability to maintain or grow its deposits if the company is unable to sufficiently maintain or grow its deposits to meet liquidity objectives it may be subject to paying higher funding costs the company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits recent increases in shortterm interest rates have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing if competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits the companys funding costs may increase either because the company raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because the company loses deposits to competitors and must rely on more expensive sources of funding customers may also move noninterestbearing deposits to interest bearing accounts increasing the cost of those deposits checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments such as the stock market as providing a better riskreturn tradeoff the companys bank customers could withdraw their money and put it in alternative investments causing the company to lose a lower cost source of funding higher funding costs could reduce the companys net interest margin and net interest income our wholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits or support our future growth as a part of our liquidity management we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments these sources include brokered deposits repurchase agreements federal funds purchased and federal home loan bank advances negative operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to an inability to replace these additional funding sources at maturity our financial flexibility could be constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates finally if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs in this case our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively affected old national relies on dividends from old national bank for its liquidity old national bancorp is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries old national bancorp typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends these dividends are old national bancorps principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock pay interest and principal on its debt and fund purchases of its common stock various federal andor state laws and regulations as well as regulatory expectations limit the amount of dividends that old national bank and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay see item business supervision and regulation dividends limitations for a discussion of restrictions on dividends limitations on the companys ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt and ability to fund purchases of its common stock a reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our business andor the holders of our securities the credit rating agencies rating our indebtedness regularly evaluate old national and old national bank credit ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings as well as factors not entirely within our control including conditions affecting the banking industry or financial services industry generally and the economy and changes in rating methodologies there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings a downgrade of the credit ratings of old national or old national bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital significantly increase our cost of funds and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities this could affect our growth profitability and financial condition including liquidity unrealized losses in our securities portfolio could affect liquidity as market interest rates have increased we have experienced unrealized losses on our availableforsale securities portfolio unrealized losses related to availableforsale securities are reflected in investment securities availableforsale in our consolidated balance sheets and reduce the level of our book capital and tangible common equity however such unrealized losses do not affect our regulatory capital ratios we actively monitor our availableforsale securities portfolio and we do not currently anticipate the need to realize material losses from the sale of securities for liquidity purposes furthermore we believe it is unlikely that we would be required to sell any such securities before recovery of their amortized cost bases which may be at maturity nonetheless if there are unrealized or realized losses in our securities portfolio our access to liquidity sources could be adversely affected tangible capital ratios may decline the fhlb or other funding sources may reduce our borrowing capacity or bank regulators may impose restrictions on us that impact the level of interest rates we may pay on deposits or our ability to access brokered deposits additionally significant unrealized or realized losses could negatively impact market andor customer perceptions of our company which could lead to a loss of depositor confidence and an increase in deposit withdrawals particularly among those with uninsured deposits operational risks a failure or breach including cyberattacks of our operational or security systems could disrupt our business result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our clients there is no assurance that our security measures will provide absolute security further to access our products and services our clients may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems in fact many other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks andor malicious code or by means of phishing attacks social engineering and other means as our reliance on technology systems increases including as a result of workfromhome arrangements the potential risks of technologyrelated interruptions in our operations or the occurrence of cyber incidents also increases our technologies systems networks and our customers devices are periodically the target of cyberattacks and may be the target of future cyberattacks malicious actors may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information including passwords and other identifying information in order to gain access to data or our systems certain financial institutions in the united states have also experienced attacks from technically sophisticated and wellresourced third parties that were intended to disrupt normal business activities by making internet banking systems inaccessible to clients for extended periods these denialofservice attacks typically do not breach data security systems but require substantial resources to defend and may affect client satisfaction and behavior there have been several wellpublicized attacks on various companies including in the financial services industry and personal proprietary and public email systems in which the perpetrators gained unauthorized access to confidential information and customer data often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks phishing or other means even if not directed at the company or its subsidiaries specifically attacks on other entities with whom we do business or on whom we otherwise rely or attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could adversely affect directly or indirectly aspects of our business despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources including persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our systems or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities system enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing and integrating new systems due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our systems can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues if our security systems were penetrated or circumvented it could cause serious negative consequences for us including significant disruption of our operations misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our clients or damage our computers or systems and those of our clients and counterparties and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws financial loss to us or to our clients loss of confidence in our security measures client dissatisfaction significant litigation exposure regulatory action and harm to our reputation all of which could have a material adverse effect on us old national is subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients employees or others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the company to liability andor reputational damage old national is subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients employees or others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the company to liability andor reputational damage changes to customer data privacy laws and regulations may impose additional operational burdens on the company may limit the companys ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of customer data compliance with these laws and regulations may require changes to policies procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data which could among other things make the company more vulnerable to operational failures and to monetary penalties litigation or regulatory enforcement actions for breach of such laws and regulations as privacyrelated laws and regulations are implemented they may also limit how companies like old national can use customer data and impose obligations on companies in their management of such data the time and resources needed for the company to comply with such laws and regulations as well as its potential liability for noncompliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase we rely on third party vendors which could expose old national to additional cybersecurity and operational risks third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure including certain data processing and information services third parties may transmit confidential propriety information on our behalf although we require third party providers to maintain certain levels of information security such providers may remain vulnerable to breaches unauthorized access misuse computer viruses or other malicious attacks that could ultimately compromise sensitive information while we may contractually limit our liability in connection with attacks against third party providers old national remains exposed to the risk of loss associated with such vendors in addition operational errors information system failures or interruptions of vendors systems or difficulty communicating with vendors could expose us to disruption of operations loss of service or connectivity to customers reputational damage and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations in addition our operations are exposed to risk that vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements although we have selected external vendors carefully we do not control their actions the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements because of changes in the vendors organizational structure financial condition support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason could be disruptive to our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations replacing a vendor particularly a large national entity with a dominant market presence such as a number of our current vendors could also cause us to incur significant delay and expense failure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect old nationals results of operations and financial condition the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve clients and to reduce costs old nationals future success depends in part upon its ability to address client needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in old nationals operations old national may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its clients failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect old nationals growth revenue and profit failure to successfully implement and integrate future system enhancements could adversely affect the companys ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements which could result in sanctions from regulatory authorities future system enhancements could have higher than expected costs andor result in operating inefficiencies which could increase the costs associated with the implementation as well as ongoing operations upgrading the companys computer systems software and networks subjects the company to the risk of disruptions failures or delays due to the complexity and interconnectedness of the companys computer systems software and networks the failure to properly upgrade or maintain these computer systems software and networks could result in greater susceptibility to cyberattacks particularly in light of the greater frequency and severity of attacks in recent years as well as the growing prevalence of supply chain attacks affecting software and information service providers failures related to upgrades and maintenance also increase risks related to unauthorized access and misuse there can be no assurance that any such disruptions failures or delays will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed changes in consumer use of banks and changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect old nationals financial results technology and other changes now allow many clients to complete financial transactions without using banks for example consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank this process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of client deposits and income generated from those deposits in addition changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect old nationals operations and old national may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes old nationals controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and old nationals methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective old national regularly reviews and updates its internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures old national also maintains an enterprise risk management program designed to identify manage mitigate monitor aggregate and report risks any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met additionally instruments systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance credit liquidity operational and business risks and enterprisewide risk could be less effective than anticipated as a result old national may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk pandemics acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could significantly affect old nationals business pandemics acts of war global military conflicts or terrorism and other adverse external events including severe weather and other natural disasters could have a significant impact on the companys ability to conduct business such events could affect the stability of the companys deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause the company to incur additional expenses although the company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company depending on the impact of pandemics global military conflicts or terrorism and other adverse external events on general economic and market conditions consumer and corporate spending and investment and borrowing patterns there is a risk that adverse conditions could occur including supply chain disruptions higher inflation decreased demand for the companys products and services or those of its borrowers which could increase credit risk challenges related to maintaining sufficient qualified personnel due to labor shortages talent attrition employee illness willingness to return to work disruptions to business operations at the company and at counterparties vendors and other service providers to the extent that pandemics acts of war global military conflicts or terrorism and other external events adversely affect old nationals business financial liquidity capital or results of operations it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this risk factors section old national is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities a significant portion of the companys loan portfolio is secured by real property during the ordinary course of business the company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if hazardous or toxic substances are found the company may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage environmental laws may require the company to incur substantial expenses and could materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit the companys ability to sell the affected property or to repay the indebtedness secured by the property in addition future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the companys exposure to environmental liability although the company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition results of operations and liquidity old nationals reported financial condition and results of operations depend on managements selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the companys reported financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results several of old nationals accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the companys financial statements if assumptions or estimates underlying the companys financial statements are incorrect the company may experience material losses management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets liabilities commitments and contingencies a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income recognizing an expense recovering an asset valuing an asset or liability or recognizing or reducing a liability old national has established detailed policies and control procedures with respect to these critical accounting estimates however because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters old national could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect see item critical accounting estimates for a discussion of the companys critical accounting estimates legal regulatory and compliance risks old national operates in a highly regulated environment and changes in laws and regulations to which old national is subject may adversely affect old nationals results of operations old national operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by among others the occ the federal reserve the fdic and the cfpb and applicable state laws such regulation and supervision is primarily intended for the protection of the depositors and federal deposit insurance funds in addition the us department of the treasury the us treasury has certain supervisory and oversight duties and responsibilities see business supervision and regulation herein our business is highly regulated and the laws rules regulations and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change and there have been significant revisions to the laws rules regulations and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to banks and bank holding companies that have been enacted or proposed in recent years in addition we expect that we will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision and that the level of regulatory scrutiny may fluctuate over time based on numerous factors including the occs heightened standards when applicable to us changes in us presidential administrations or one or both houses of congress and public sentiment regarding financial institutions which can be influenced by scandals and other incidents that involve participants in the industry we are unable to predict the form or nature of any future changes to the laws rules regulations or supervisory guidance and policies including the interpretation or implementation thereof changes to applicable laws rules regulations and supervisory guidance and policies including changes in interpretation or implementation thereof have and could in the future subject us to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products we may offer andor increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products among other things failure to comply with applicable laws rules regulations and supervisory guidance and policies could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal or state authorities including criminal and civil penalties the loss of fdic insurance revocation of a banking charter other sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we anticipate increased regulatory scrutiny in the course of routine examinations and otherwise and new regulations in response to recent negative developments in the banking industry which may increase our cost of doing business and reduce our profitability among other things there may be increased focus by both regulators and investors on deposit composition the level of uninsured deposits brokered deposits unrealized losses in securities portfolios liquidity commercial real estate loan composition and concentrations and capital as well as general oversight and control of the foregoing we could face increased scrutiny or be viewed as higher risk by regulators andor the investor community which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations see item business supervision and regulation and note to the consolidated financial statements fee revenues from overdraft protection programs may be subject to increased supervisory scrutiny in the company collected million in overdraft transaction fees members of congress and the leadership of the occ and cfpb have expressed a heightened interest in bank overdraft protection programs on january the cfpb proposed a rule that would significantly reform the regulatory framework governing overdraft practices applicable to banks such as old national bank that have more than billion in assets if adopted as proposed the proposed rule would likely result in decreased revenue from overdraft transaction fees for old national bank see business supervision and regulation herein for more information about this proposed rule these actions are a component of the cfpbs broader supervision and enforcement initiative targeting socalled consumer junk fees in addition the occ has identified potential options for reform of national bank overdraft protection practices including providing a grace period before the imposition of a fee refraining from charging multiple fees in a single day and eliminating fees altogether in response to this increased congressional and regulatory scrutiny and in anticipation of enhanced supervision and enforcement of overdraft protection practices in the future certain banking organizations have modified their overdraft protection programs including by discontinuing the imposition of overdraft transaction fees these competitive pressures from our peers as well as any adoption by our regulators of new rules or supervisory guidance or more aggressive examination and enforcement policies in respect of banks overdraft protection practices could cause us to modify our program and practices in ways that may have a negative impact on our revenue and earnings which in turn could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition as supervisory expectations and industry practices regarding overdraft protection programs change our continued offering of overdraft protection may result in negative public opinion and increased reputation risk we may incur fines penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations the financial services industry is subject to significant regulation and scrutiny from bank regulatory authorities in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of federal and state laws rules and regulations particularly with respect to mortgagerelated practices and other consumer compliance matters and compliance with antimoney laundering bsa and ofac regulations and economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and nationals enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices in addition some legalregulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance in place at the time there have been a number of significant enforcement actions in recent years by regulators state attorneys general and the us department of justice against banks and other nonbank financial institutions with respect to antimoney laundering and sanctions laws and some have resulted in substantial penalties including criminal pleas although the company has adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws rules and regulations any failure to comply with these laws rules and regulations or to maintain an adequate compliance program could result in significant fines penalties lawsuits regulatory sanctions reputational damage or restrictions on our business we have risk related to legal proceedings we are involved in judicial regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising from our business activities and fiduciary responsibilities we establish an accrual for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated we may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established an accrual in addition the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts accrued for that matter the ultimate resolution of a pending or future proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could materially affect how old national reports its financial condition and results of operations the fasb periodically changes the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of old nationals financial statements additionally those bodies that establish andor interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations on how these standards should be applied these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how old national records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases old national could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard resulting in changes to previously reported financial results if old national fails to meet regulatory capital requirements which may require heightened capital levels we may be forced to raise capital or sell assets old national is subject to regulations that require us to satisfy certain capital ratios such as the ratio of our tier capital to our riskbased assets regulators have implemented and may from time to time implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy requirements if we are unable to satisfy these regulatory capital requirements due to a decline in the value of our loan portfolio or otherwise we will be required to improve such capital ratios by either raising additional capital or by disposing of assets if we choose to dispose of assets we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so at prices that we believe to be appropriate and our future operating results could be negatively affected if we choose to raise additional capital we may accomplish this by selling additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock which could dilute the ownership percentage of holders of our common stock and cause the market price of our common stock to decline additionally events or circumstances in the capital markets generally may increase our capital costs and impair our ability to raise capital at any given time see business supervision and regulation capital adequacy herein for further discussion on regulatory capital requirements applicable to the company and old national bank old national could be subject to adverse changes or interpretations of tax laws tax audits or challenges to our tax positions old national is subject to federal and applicable state income tax laws and regulations income tax laws and regulations are often complex and require significant judgment in determining the companys effective tax rate and in evaluating the companys tax positions changes in tax laws changes in interpretations guidance or regulations currently in effect or that may be promulgated or challenges to judgments or actions that the company may take with respect to tax laws could negatively impact our current and future financial performance in addition our determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable tax authorities in the normal course of business we are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and applicable state and local taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged recently federal and state and local taxing authorities have been increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions the challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions any such challenges that are not resolved in our favor may adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition our earnings could be adversely impacted by incidences of fraud and compliance failure financial institutions are inherently exposed to fraud risk a fraud can be perpetrated by an employee a vendor or members of the general public or by or at a client of old national we are most subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of loans ach transactions wire transactions atm transactions and checking transactions our largest fraud risk associated with the origination of loans includes the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to us by third parties compliance risk is the risk that loans are not originated in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our standards there can be no assurance that we can prevent or detect acts of fraud or violation of law or our compliance standards by the third parties that we deal with repeated incidences of fraud or compliance failures would adversely impact the performance of our loan portfolio
