rules the basel iii capital rules adopted by the federal reserve these rules implement the basel iii framework set forth by the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act under the basel iii capital rules the company and old national bank are required to maintain the following a minimum ratio of common equity tier capital cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least plus a capital conservation buffer that is composed entirely of cet1 capital resulting in a minimum ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least a minimum ratio of tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least plus the capital conservation buffer resulting in a minimum tier capital ratio of a minimum ratio of total capital tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least plus the capital conservation buffer resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of a minimum leverage ratio of calculated as the ratio of tier capital to average assets the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income that is the greater of i net income for the preceding four quarters net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income and ii average net income over the preceding four quarters the basel iii capital rules also provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 that include for example goodwill other intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards net of any related valuation allowance mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions must also be deducted from cet1 to the extent that they exceed certain thresholds the company and old national bank as nonadvanced approaches banking organizations as classified under the basel iii capital rules made a onetime permanent election to exclude the effects of certain aoci items included in shareholders equity under gaap in determining regulatory capital ratios in november the federal bank regulators issued a final rule that extended certain transition provisions related to the capital treatment for certain deferred tax assets mortgage servicing rights investments in nonconsolidated financial entities and minority interests for banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches framework under the basel iii capital rules such as the company and old national bank until january when final rules to simplify the regulatory treatment of those items took effect the capital simplification rules in december the basel committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the basel iii postcrisis regulatory reforms the standards are commonly referred to as basel iv among other things these standards revise the basel committees standardized approach for credit risk including the recalibration of risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital under the basel framework these standards will generally be effective on january with an aggregate output floor phasing in through january under the current us capital rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches banking organizations and not to the company or old national bank the impact of basel iv on the company and old national bank will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulators prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance act the fdia requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action for depository institutions that do not meet the minimum capital requirements the fdia includes the following five capital tiers wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized a depository institutions capital tier will depend on how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation the relevant capital measures are the total riskbased capital ratio the tier riskbased capital ratio the cet1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio a bank will be wellcapitalized if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater a cet1 capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure adequately capitalized if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater a cet1 capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not wellcapitalized undercapitalized if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of less than a tier riskbased capital ratio of less than a cet1 capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than significantly undercapitalized if the institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of less than a tier riskbased capital ratio of less than a cet1 capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than critically undercapitalized if the institutions tangible equity is equal to or less than of average quarterly tangible assets an institution may be downgraded to or deemed to be in a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating for certain matters a banks capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the banks overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes as of december old national banks capital ratios were all in excess of the minimum requirements for wellcapitalized status the fdia prohibits an insured depository institution from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the banks normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposits are solicited unless it is wellcapitalized or is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic a depository institution that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the fdic may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market areas in addition the fdia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan the agencies may not accept such a plan without determining that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institutions capital in addition the depository institutions parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan and must also provide appropriate assurances of performance for a plan to be acceptable the aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of an amount equal to of the depository institutions total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable to the institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized institutions may be subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator dividends limitation old national bank is subject to the provisions of the national bank act is supervised regulated and examined by the occ and is subject to the rules and regulations of the occ the federal reserve and the fdic a substantial portion of old nationals revenue is derived from dividends paid to it by old national bank these dividends are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements deposit insurance substantially all of the deposits of old national bank are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund dif which is administered by the fdic as insurer the fdic imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by fdicinsured institutions it may also prohibit any fdicinsured institution from engaging in any activity the fdic determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the dif insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic or written agreement entered into with the fdic fdic assessment rates for large institutions that have more than billion of assets such as old national bank are calculated based on a scorecard methodology that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large institution will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the dif if such a failure occurs based primarily on the difference between the institutions average of total assets and average tangible equity the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score up or down based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard for large institutions including old national bank after accounting for potential baserate adjustments the total assessment rate could range from to basis points on an annualized basis old nationals most recent assessment rate was basis points an institutions assessment is determined by multiplying its assessment rate by its assessment base which is asset based depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the united states and the parent bank holding company with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution employee incentive compensation under regulatory guidance applicable to all banking organizations incentive compensation policies must be consistent with safety and soundness principles under this guidance financial institutions must review their compensation programs to ensure that they i provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward and that do not encourage imprudent risk ii are compatible with effective controls and risk management and iii are supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the banking organizations board of directors monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation during as required by the doddfrank act the federal bank regulatory agencies and the sec proposed revised rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least billion of total assets including the company and old national bank these proposed rules have not been finalized cybersecurity the federal banking agencies have established certain expectations with respect to an institutions information security and cybersecurity programs with an increasing focus on risk management processes related to information technology and operational resiliency and the use of thirdparties in the provision of financial services in october the federal banking agencies jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cybersecurity riskmanagement and resilience standards that would address five categories of cyber standards which include i cyber risk governance ii cyber risk management iii internal dependency management iv external dependency management and v incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness as proposed these enhanced standards would apply only to depository institutions and depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more however it is possible that if these enhanced standards are implemented even if the billion threshold is increased the federal reserve will consider them in connection with the examination and supervision of banks below the billion threshold the federal banking agencies have not yet taken further action on these proposed standards state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements we expect this trend of statelevel activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which the company operates in february the sec published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents these sec guidelines and any other regulatory guidance are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations in november the united states federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule regarding notification requirements for banking organizations related to significant computer security incidents under the final rule a bank holding company and a state member bank are required to notify the federal reserve within hours of incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade the banking organizations ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization or impact the stability of the financial sector the rule is effective april with compliance required by may safety and soundness regulations in accordance with the fdia the federal banking agencies adopted safety and soundness guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate risk exposure cybersecurity liquidity data protection asset growth asset quality earnings compensation fees and benefits in general the guidelines require among other things appropriate systems and practices to identify monitor and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer employee director or principal shareholder in addition regulations adopted by the federal banking agencies authorize the agencies to require that an institution that has been
