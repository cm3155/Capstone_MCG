instruments and specify minimum amounts of capital as a percentage of assets that banking organizations are required to maintain under the basel iii capital rules riskbased capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity tier cet1 capital tier capital and total riskbased capital respectively by riskweighted assets assets and offbalance sheet credit equivalents are assigned a risk weight based primarily on supervisory assessments of relative credit risk under the basel iii capital rules the company and old national bank are each required to maintain the following a minimum ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets of plus a capital conservation buffer that is composed entirely of cet1 capital effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets of a

implementing these standards under the current us capital rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches banking organizations and therefore not to the company or old national bank the impact of these standards on the company and old national bank will depend on the manner in which they are implemented by the federal bank regulators prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance act the fdia requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action for depository institutions that do not meet the minimum capital

institution may be downgraded to or deemed to be in a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating for certain matters a banks capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the banks overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes as of december old national banks capital ratios were all in excess of the minimum requirements for wellcapitalized status the federal banking regulators must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are less than adequately capitalized with supervisory actions progressively becoming more punitive as the institutions capital category declines supervisory actions include i restrictions on payment of capital distributions and management fees ii requirements that a federal bank regulator monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital iii submission of a capital restoration plan iv restrictions on the growth of the institutions assets and v requirements for prior regulatory approval of certain expansion proposals a bank that is

guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the banks assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply dividends limitation s a substantial portion of old national bancorps revenue is derived from dividends paid to it by old national bank under occ regulations national banks generally may not declare a dividend in excess of the banks undivided profits or absent occ approval if the total amount of dividends declared by the national bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of the national banks retained net income yeartodate combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years national banks also are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividend if after making the dividend the national bank would be considered undercapitalized as defined by reference to other occ regulations the occ has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a national bank such as old national bank from paying dividends if in its opinion the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice further old national banks ability to pay dividends is restricted if it does not maintain the capital conservation buffer described under capital adequacycapital requirements above in addition the fdia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment

above transactions with affiliates any transactions between old national bank and its subsidiaries and old national bancorp or any other subsidiary of old national bancorp are regulated under federal banking law the federal reserve act imposes quantitative and qualitative requirements and collateral requirements on covered transactions by old national bank with or for the benefit of its affiliates

defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets from an affiliate unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for any loan the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of or for the benefit of an affiliate in general any such transaction by old national bank or its subsidiaries must be limited to certain thresholds on an individual and aggregate basis and credit transactions with or for the benefit of an affiliate must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral federal law also limits old national banks authority to extend credit to its directors executive officers and stockholders who own more than of common stock as well as to entities controlled by such persons among other things any such extension of credit is required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons in addition the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of nonrepayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate community reinvestment act the cra requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practices under the cra each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by among other things providing credit to lowincome and moderateincome individuals and small businesses in those communities federal and state regulators conduct cra examinations on a regular basis to assess the performance of financial institutions and assign one of four ratings to the institutions record of meeting the credit needs of its community bank regulators take into account cra ratings when considering approval of a proposed merger or acquisition old national bank received a rating of satisfactory in its latest cra examination in may the occ together with the federal reserve and fdic issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking to modernize the cra regulatory framework the proposed rule is intended among other things to adapt to changes in the banking industry including the expanded role of mobile and online banking and to tailor performance standards to account for differences in bank size and business models the proposed rule would adjust cra evaluations based on bank size and type with many of the proposed changes applying only to banks with over billion in assets and several applying only to banks with over billion in assets such as old national bank the effects of the proposed cra rules on old national will depend on the final form of any rulemaking deposit insurance substantially all of the deposits of old national bank are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund dif which is administered by the fdic insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution engaged or is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic or written agreement entered into with the fdic fdic assessment rates for large institutions that have more than billion of assets such as old national bank are calculated based on a scorecard methodology based primarily on the difference between the institutions average of total assets and average tangible equity the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score up or down based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the scorecard for large institutions including old national bank after accounting for potential baserate adjustments the total assessment rate could range from to basis points on an annualized basis in october the fdic finalized a rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules for all insured depository institutions by basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of the increased assessment rate is intended to improve the likelihood that the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio would reach the required minimum of percent by the statutory deadline of september depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the united states and the parent bank holding company with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution antitying restrictions generally a bank is prohibited from extending credit leasing or selling property furnishing any service or fixing or varying the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that i the customer obtains additional credit property or services from the banks parent holding company or any subsidiary of the holding company or ii the customer will not obtain credit property or services from a competitor of the bank or its affiliates except to the extent the restriction is a reasonable condition imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended employee incentive compensation under regulatory guidance applicable to all banking organizations incentive compensation policies must be consistent with safety and soundness principles under this guidance financial institutions must review their compensation programs to ensure that they i provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward and that do not encourage imprudent risk ii are compatible with effective controls and risk management and iii are supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the banking organizations board of directors monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation during the federal bank regulatory agencies and the sec proposed revised rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least billion of total assets including the company and old national bank these proposed rules have not been finalized in october the sec adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations including nasdaq to implement listing standards that require all listed companies to adopt policies mandating the recovery or clawback of excess incentivebased compensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding a required accounting restatement including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period the excess compensation would be based on the amount the executive officer would have received had the incentivebased compensation been determined using the restated financial statements the final rule requires the exchanges to propose conforming listing standards by february and requires the standards to become effective no later than november each listed issuer including the company would then be required to adopt a clawback policy within days after its exchanges listing standard has become effective cybersecurity the federal banking regulators regularly issue new guidance and standards and update existing guidance and standards regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions financial institutions are expected to comply with such guidance and standards and to accordingly develop appropriate security controls and risk management processes state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs
