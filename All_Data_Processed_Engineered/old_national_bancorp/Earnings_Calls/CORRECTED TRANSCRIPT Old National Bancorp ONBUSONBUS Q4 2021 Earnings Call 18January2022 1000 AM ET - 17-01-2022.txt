with net recoveries of million for the year we also saw record wealth management revenues in im particularly pleased that commercial loans are now up in total from levels excluding the impact of ppp thats significant growth amid a global pandemic and weve maintained a consistently strong credit profile in the process weve opportunistically leaned in when several of our competitors froze and we continue to benefit from that stance taking share by doing what we do best consistent quality growth moving to slide our fourth quarter eps was adjusted eps was we saw strong commercial loan production of billion during the quarter and excellent credit quality our pipeline ended the year at a robust billion a quick update on hiring we opportunistically added significant talent during the quarter especially on our commercial and wealth management teams building upon our recent success in st louis weve hired two industry veterans to start an lpo in kansas city which should be operating at full strength later in the quarter weve also begun recruiting talent in chicago anticipating that chicago and minneapolis will be a significant focus in in summary our talent pipeline remains strong i am personally active in recruiting key team members and we will continue to make these vital investments throughout the year moving to slide which contains a quick refresher on some of our accomplishments and next steps with our partnership with first midwest as you know both companies have tremendous integration history and experience and as a result our work is going very well we have decision and communicated the organizational structure and leadership positions for all client segments and support areas weve also settled on our core processing system and supporting applications our team member excitement our team members ph engagement and excitement remained strong and as a result weve seen minimal clientfacing roles minimal attrition on our clientfacing roles our combined leadership teams continue to meet and build a collective longterm strategy and develop tactics to accelerate our combined growth while were still waiting on federal reserve approval we continue to have frequent and constructive dialogue with the fed staff who assure us our application is complete and ready for review at the board level we expect we will hear positive news this quarter as soon as we hear we will move expeditiously towards the close with a more elongatedthanexpected regulatory approval and the global pandemicrelated issues affecting the availability of labor and it equipment we now expect our systems to conversion to occur in july given the delayed systems conversion we expect to achieve closer to of the run rate savings we modeled in we still expect to achieve of the original model savings of million in lastly despite potential distraction from the lingering pandemicrelated issues and our transformational merger we remain highly focused on serving our clients and communities i think our results for the quarter and the year illustrate the success of those efforts our success would not have been possible without one of the strongest teams in the industry im also grateful for the hundreds of team members who are focused on the successful integration of the combined companies thank you and ill now turn the call over to brendon old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 brendon b falconer senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you jim turning to slide our gaap earnings per share was and our adjusted earnings per share was adjusted earnings exclude million in mergerrelated charges as well as in debt securities gains slide shows the trend in commercial loans and the related pipeline and production trends all excluding the impact of ppp loans  represents our sixth consecutive quarter of organic loan growth with commercial ph outstanding increasing over with both cre and ci showing solid growth strong commercial production of billion was wellbalanced across all our major markets were also pleased that the strong fourth quarter production did not have a significant impact on our pipeline which ended the year at billion the highest yearend level on record the size and quality of the pipeline that includes almost million in the accepted category supports our optimistic outlook on loan growth heading into turning briefly to pricing new money yields on ci were which are now well above portfolio yields new cre production yields were slightly lower for the quarter at more than of that production is indexed to shortterm rates with good spreads but relatively low absolute coupons while this puts some pressure on margin in the near term it does position us well for a rising rate environment the investment portfolio increased this quarter as deposit growth once again outpaced total loan growth we continue to put much of the excess liquidity to work in our invest portfolio new money yields on investments improved basis point quarteroverquarter to with portfolio duration shorter by a ph quarter year moving to slide we again saw meaningful increases in both period end and average deposit balances quarterly growth came largely from our retail clients with business clients drawing down on noninterestbearing accounts total cost of deposits for the quarter was basis points while total interestbearing liabilities was basis points both down basis point from  next on slide you will see details of our net interest income and margins net interest income excluding ppp decreased just which was consistent with both our expectations and goal of maintaining stable nii throughout this challenging rate environment net interest margin decreased basis points from prior quarter to and core margin excluding accretion and ppp declined basis points to excess liquidity and interest collected on nonaccrual loans accounted for basis points of the decline slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income adjusted noninterest income for the quarter at million was million lower than  largely due to seasonal declines in mortgage our wealth line of business finished with a strong fourth quarter which resulted in record revenue for the year our capital markets business had another strong quarter it finished the year just shy of last years record revenue mortgage production was up slightly in the quarter but a seasonal decline in the size of the pipeline resulted in a million decrease in revenue next slide shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses adjusting for merger charges and tax credit amortization noninterest expense was million the quarteroverquarter increase was driven by additional lending incentives related to strong commercial and mortgage production additionally increases in marketing and professional fees categories were related to investments in minnesota marketing efforts and the establishment of a new brand for a high net worth wealth division that we discussed last quarter old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 turning to ppp loans on slide you will see a roll forward of those balances which finished just million at quarter end unamortized fees on the remaining loans totaled million we anticipate most of the remaining loans will be forgiven in the first half of and the related fees recognized accordingly slide shows our credit trends credit conditions continue to be benign and our commercial and consumer portfolios continue to perform exceptionally well delinquencies ticked up basis point to end the quarter at a very low basis points we were pleased to post a fifth consecutive quarter in a net recovery position resulting in full year net recoveries of million the nonperforming loans to total loan ratio once again hit a new cycle low at basis points and while this metric remains higher than peers the net chargeoffs to npl ratio is significantly better than peers we believe our approach to downgrading troubled credits early and a patient approach to workout results in better outcomes for our clients and ultimately lower costs for the bank on slide you will see the details of our fourth quarter allowance which stands at million a slight decline from  credit loss expectations showed a slight improvement quarteroverquarter but the related reserve release was largely offset by additional reserves for loan growth while our outlook on credit remains optimistic we believe it is still prudent to maintain above average levels of qualitative reserves which showed a million to quarter end as a reminder we also continue to carry million in unamortized marks from our acquired portfolios as i wrap up my comments here are some key takeaways we are very pleased with the fundamental results of the quarter and year strong commercial loan growth led to stable core net interest income despite interest rate headwinds our feebased businesses led by wealth mortgage and capital markets continue to perform well and provide a great launching point for expenses remained well controlled and our strong credit quality continues to keep credit costs low slide includes thoughts and our outlook for we ended the quarter with a healthy billion commercial pipeline which supports our favorable outlook on loan growth this historically low interest rate environment will continue to put pressure on net interest income which should be mitigated through continued earning asset growth rising shortterm rates will have a positive impact on earnings as we have gradually repositioned the balance sheet to a more assetsensitive position the ppp loan forgiveness process continues for our clients we expect runoff of most of the remaining balances and related fee recognition to occur in the first half of we expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well we are encouraged by the momentum in our wealth business and the strong commercial activity should help maintain the high level of performance in our capital markets business mortgage revenue should follow industry trends and be seasonally lower in the first quarter our other fee lines are expected to be stable in the nearterm onb standalone expenses are expected to rise to in and should follow typical seasonal pattern the estimate includes an expectation of slightly higher merit increases related to inflation and continued strategic investments in both revenue talent and technology a brief update on taxes we continue to expect a reduction in the volatility caused by our tax credits as we work through the last of the remaining oneyear historical tax credit commitments in total we are expecting approximately million in tax credit amortization for the year with a corresponding onb standalone fullyear effective tax rate of approximately to the pro forma indiscernible for the combined company would be in the range of to old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 in light of the delayed close of our merger with fmb we want to provide an update on the combined company expense expectations our june announcement assumed of the annualized cost synergies would be realized in the first quarter close of the deal and a corresponding july conversion date is now expected to reduce the impact to approximately of the total synergies with the majority realized in the second half of the year that said we are still confident we will realize of the million in targeted savings which will help us deliver meaningful positive operating leverage in other words the magnitude of the saves is unchanged but the timing has now elongated by days with that we are happy to answer any questions that you may have and we do have the full team here including jim sandgren daryl moore and john moran also joining us this morning is mark sander president and coo of first midwest bank question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of ben gerlinger with hovde group james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc good morning everyone good morning i was curious if we could take a minute to talk kind of high level loan growth through the pandemic old national and first midwest did a pretty solid job growing loans pretty consistently throughout the pandemic especially when you compared it to like fed h8 data so when you look at the fourth quarter old national was a little bit lower which makes sense if you look over fourth quarter run rate you guys have done a better job and then with the commentary about boding well for future growth i was curious in kind of what you guys are seeing from kind of the ground level in terms of your clients their loan demand typically fourth quarter kind of pulls in from first quarters demand and first quarter is usually flat just kind of curious if you could just spend some time thinking out loud about how your clients are approaching their need for loans and what it might mean for you guys in the first half of james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah ben this is jim sandgren i think you nailed it obviously really strong production in the fourth quarter pipelines down a little bit seasonally in the process of building those back up i will tell you i think from grassroots our clients feel really optimistic in spite of the challenges that they continue to face around labor and supply chain but the other thing that caused a little concern in the fourth quarter was high level of payoffs again highest level that weve seen in a number of years and dont know if that will continue in the first quarter or not but i do think the pipeline continues to reflect that our customers are investing and growing if they can find the labor so again we think well get off to a good start just not knowing exactly where that those payoffs will continue to land james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 and mark would you like to add anything from your perspective mark g sander a president chief operating officer director first midwest bancorp inc illinois i think its very similar to what jim said pipelines are strong customers i think are optimistic there is still a fair amount of liquidity in the system of course and payoffs are elevated but our production is good and solid and should put position us well for loan growth coming right out of the box in  benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc great thats helpful and then brendon if you can kind of just look at the yield curve expectations going forward i know that you have two balance sheets coming together you have indiscernible so if you if the markets kind of expecting to have three to four hikes in and beyond a couple more i was curious if you had any idea of where the margin might shake out as we end with the two like kind of combining everything together brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp sure yeah ben i think youre right i think short of rate changes i think were getting close to the floor i dont think were all the way there yet i think there could be continue to be some margin compression without some help from the fed we have looked at both balance sheets and the margin impact from rate increases and how wed like to model that up ben is against the floor curve and so we think the onb standalone is going to get some upward movement to about to in nii on a standalone basis and when we fold in fmb which has a slightly more assetsensitive balance sheet has a little more cash on hand we think thats closer to to again i get the forward rate which is now kind of to for rate hikes embedded in there benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc okay great thats helpful i will ill step back indiscernible james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks ben operator your next question is from scott siefers with piper sandler james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question brendon wanted to follow on some of those rate sensitivity comments can you maybe talk a little bit about where youre most sensitive on the curve or i guess ideally where on a pro forma basis youll be more most sensitive do you benefit most at the beginning of tightening cycle or will it take a few hikes for you to feel the full benefit old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp no i think we benefit right out of the gate with shortterm hikes yeah it shouldnt be a significant difference from quartertoquarter ultimately longterm impact of this will be what happens where does the middle and long end of the curve shake out from a longterm perspective but in this first few quarters well benefit right out of the gate r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and maybe how do your thoughts on deposit betas fit into the equation brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah so what we modeled was i think a fairly conservative view of deposit betas that are a little below for the longterm fullcycle rate cycle but in that to which frankly could be very conservative assumption given how we reacted for the first three rate hikes last cycle i think well be able to manage deposit betas very well for the first year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then just as it relates to the closure of that transaction how quickly would you guys be able to close after you do receive fed approval i imagine youre pretty much good to go just sort of waiting on the that green light but what kind of a timeframe would we be looking at james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp well we need at least days from whenever we receive approval and more than likely we would do it at the beginning or end of a month or beginning of the next month just to keep the accounting clean and smooth so just depends on when we might hear and how close we are to the next kind of beginning of a month scott but again other than that hope were ready to close r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right good thank you guys very much operator your next question is from terry mcevoy with stephens james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone jim maybe start with a question for you old national resolved that issue in indianapolis kind of a day before the fed approved a few transactions you guys obviously werent on that list is old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 there anything that im missing out there that maybe i just havent picked up on and is there anything you can share with us that gives you confidence that the transaction can close here in the first quarter james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp well all that i can say is we continue to have very constructive dialogue and i think its just a matter of timing and as you can imagine theres a lot of priorities right now at the fed we had two fed governors just as recently as last week going through their confirmation hearings indiscernible a lot on their plate right they got lot of changes so we are patiently waiting and those three prior announcements were ones that were in the queue longer than us right so i have nothing no reason to believe that we wont hear positive news and so were just we expect that well hear that news here soon and well move towards close like i said but nothing theres no outstanding questions or issues that were aware of and feel like were in good shape and ready for approval terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great and it seems like every week a large bank announced a announces a new deposit product to reduce overdraft fees could you maybe just talk about the old national kind of overdraft structure and product how does that compare to first midwest and whether you think you need to make any changes going forward when the two companies combine james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp i would just say we are aligning our process and process together as we come together during the conversion in july weve been spending a lot of time on that that probably means slightly lower income for the old national deposit service charge program and we are looking at like everybody else whats going on in the industry were not going to be immune from those changes in the future i think its a little early to know exactly how its going to shake out for banks our size but clearly the national banks are moving towards a program so were going to continue to watch it were going to continue to do the right things and i would say our programs are kind of right in the middle with everybody else as we align the two programs and well just have to wait and see ultimately if theres a standard that gets set and how that might impact us in the future terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and maybe if i could squeeze in one more you mentioned recruiting in chicago is that because you see the pro forma company just having the ability to have a larger kind of platform and the need for more lenders or do you expect some attrition and you want to fill some holes so to speak in the company james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp weve really seen almost no or minimal attrition so far and dont expect to have any i mean our teams from day one saw the opportunity right and were excited about what that might mean for them i just think theres an opportunity to continue to invest we have a great story to tell when we get a chance to tell the story to potential team members they like it they feel the energy they feel the opportunity thats in front of them and so its being more opportunistic around that and i just believe theres always an opportunity to add talent and so were just going to continue to go out and do that but nothing that were worried about in terms of our existing team we got great team members in chicago today who are completely capable of doing the work but i do think theres more old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 opportunity and we will have a bigger balance sheet i think therell be more middle market opportunities for us just we combine the two companies and well continue to take advantage of that client set and make sure we got team members who can fill those needs terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you jim james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks terry operator your next question is from chris mcgratty with kbw james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning jim question on just the balance sheet position in the close in pro forma brendon maybe a question for you any tweaks that you might be doing on either side of the balance sheet to kind of put your best foot forward pro forma brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah chris yeah were taking a look at that i guess what we can tell you now is anything that we do will not be material to the overall balance sheet and certainly anything we do well be looking to do in an eps and capital neutral way christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then once you close obviously youre in a very strong capital position what are the philosophical thoughts on a buyback at these levels james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp well obviously dont want to do anything ahead of any kind of federal reserve approval so i think once hopefully we receive approval very soon i think we can look back at our capital and just make any actions going forward were obviously going to be at a low point once we close and mark the balance sheet and so well be looking at that and well be looking at it quite frankly as whats the best return of capital right and so well just continue to do what weve always done weve probably run a little more capital on average than some of our peers especially given our credit quality but well make sure we do the appropriate things for shareholders and manage capital and take a look at that but as brendon said its still little too early were looking at the balance sheet and any potential actions we might take but if we do anything its going to be pretty minimal old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay but postclosing the message on a buyback is its on the table but its balanced against the growth is that the right interpretation james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp absolutely absolutely christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then maybe one more on deposits i think we as analysts continue to be surprised by the pace and the stickiness of the deposits what are you seeing like incrementally on deposit growth what are your expectations for maybe the next six to nine months brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah chris so i think we were a little surprised to see acceleration of the growth again here in the fourth quarter it had slowed a bit in the third and picked back up pace and as we study this and look at past cycles our view is that this sticks around for longer and that growth may moderate a bit but we dont see that at least in the near term this is going to run out of the bank very quickly that said we are prepared we have a tremendous amount of asset liquidity if this does get ahead of us i think we have a really strong balance sheet and great liquidity position to manage through that too christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks thanks brendon operator operator instructions your next question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning everyone maybe obvious here but on slide your nii guide im assuming that assumes no rate increases is that right brendon brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thats correct thats exactly how were indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 okay yeah brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay okay good and then in terms of your expense guide the to how much of that is hiring versus just call it natural pressures on expenses like comp and technology james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah i mean those are the two biggest factors right and clearly our merit process is more outsized than it has been in the past we anticipated this and we tried to get ahead of this a couple years back but were also accelerating some of those increases particularly at the lowest wage side and then obviously our hiring i think well be pretty consistent with what we did last year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp so thats kind of built in the run rate at some level but and on average they are more expensive the people were hiring today are more expensive than maybe kind of our average team member today so i think like any other bank that ive seen so far were not going to be immune from that historically would have thought our expense growth would have been flattish yearoveryear and today were saying its up or depending on kind of those needs jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then if you set aside the synergies from the merger safe to assume that we should expect similar type growth at first midwest on their core james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yes brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp similar yes jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 yeah okay and then one more thing on lending its obviously picked up a little bit for the industry in terms of commercial you guys have certainly bucked that trend and had better growth but do you expect the pipeline numbers to continue to increase is there anything different in terms of the loan growth story thats emerging right now or is it just really more of the same brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah jon i would think that pipelines would continue to rebuild and grow like they did last year we havent seen anything to the contrary but certainly stay very close to our customers but again optimism for our customer base continues to be good in spite of the challenges that are facing them with supply chain and labor james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp and i would also add some of our new talent coming online jon and their ability to run out their noncompetes and things like that i think gives us more confidence the team were just putting in place right now in kansas city again those will all be kind of net additive to the pipeline as we continue to hire new talent and get them in a ready place to be successful jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay okay and any theme on the new talent youre hiring and is it just big bank fatigue wanting to come to a company like yours but any thematic story behind that james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah i think its a lot of it i think its sometimes its hard to do your job to serve your clients serve your communities at some of the largest institutions and i think they see a growth story here an entrepreneur little bit entrepreneurial story here and all that is pretty exciting to be a part of right and for better or worse some of those largest competitors we face in our markets have lost that ability to do that and so but we feel really good about the story and clearly its working its an interesting time right now were just kind of working through yearend stuff but im confident well continue to hire new talent as we enter the new year here and continue to have lots of opportunities in front of us jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you operator at this time there are no additional questions james c ryan chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp well thanks everybody for joining us and as you i know youve got a busy day in front of you and as usual lynell and john and brendon and myself are all here to take phone calls so we appreciate it have a great day old national bancorp onb corrected transcript
