per share in line with expectations these solid third quarter results were driven by our ability to execute on our organic growth strategy and invest in new markets and talent in our footprint our results were also driven by the strong organic deposit growth prudent loan growth durable margin management and focused efforts in growing our fee income old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 businesses moving to our third quarter highlights on slide we reported gaap earnings of per common share and our adjusted eps was our adjusted roatce for the quarter was and our adjusted roa was our adjusted efficiency ratio was a low our core deposit growth was strong at annualized with our noninterestbearing deposits growing nearly million during the quarter our total cost of deposits for the quarter remains at a low basis points and we were already taking advantage of recent fed actions which john will touch on later in his comments meanwhile our commercial loans were up annualized due to disciplined client selection growing our tangible common book value per share remains a top priority rising since the second quarter of and yearoveryear in summary our third quarter earnings evidenced another strong quarter for old national we remain focused on the fundamentals continue to fund loan growth with lowcost core deposits effectively managing credit creating positive operating leverage through disciplined expense management and consistently growing tangible book value per share with that i will now turn the call over to john moran john v moran iv chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp thanks jim turning to slide you can see our third quarter balance sheet which highlights continued improvement in our liquidity and our capital position total deposit growth over the last year has again allowed us to organically fund loan growth while reducing our borrowings as jim just mentioned we grew our tangible book value per share by over the last year and by from the prior quarter we ended the quarter with a strong cet1 ratio of and we continue to expect that we will accrete capital at a faster pace than most our liquidity and capital levels continue to provide a strong foundation which positions us well as we finish on slide we show our earning asset trends total loans grew annualized from last quarter in line with industry performance with strong production in our commercial book in the quarter partly offset by payoffs we remain focused on full relationships and structure at prices that meet our risk adjusted return requirements quarterly new loan production rates in the mid7 range and marginal funding costs in the low range support our expectation that net interest income will grow modestly in the investment portfolio increased in the quarter due to reinvestment of cash flows and positive changes in fair values with duration decreasing to just under four years we have approximately billion in cash flows expected over the next months new money yields are currently running approximately basis points above back book yields on securities and approximately basis points above back book yields on fixed rate loans moving to slide we show our trend in total deposits which grew annualized from core deposits exbrokered were up an even better annualized and we saw a nearly million increase in noninterestbearing deposits in the quarter commercial and community deposits were up and public funds saw normal seasonal increases our brokered deposits decreased and at as a percentage of total deposits our use of brokered remains well below peer levels we did see a basis point increase in deposit rates compared to the prior quarter as we remained on offense with respect to client acquisition and we drove our loantodeposit ratio below total deposit cost decreased in september consistent with fed actions and our spot rate at september was basis points moreover our exception priced book has seen a down beta since we started lowering rates in that book in early this was in line with our expectations overall we are highly confident in the execution of our deposit strategy and it continues to unfold as we expected we are prepared to proactively respond to future fed rate actions and the evolving environment while staying focused on driving above peer deposit growth at reasonable costs slide provides our quarter end income statement we reported gaap net income applicable to common shares of million or per old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 share reported earnings include per share of mergerrelated and separation expenses excluding these items our adjusted earnings per share was moving on to slide we present details of our net interest income and margin net interest income grew as expected while net interest margin was essentially unchanged as increases in asset yields and accretion were offset by deposit costs yearoveryear we again showed deposit growth that essentially kept pace with asset generation while maintaining a low total cost of funding slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income which was million for the quarter and above our expectations our primary fee businesses all performed well with bank fees ahead of expectations mortgage benefiting from seasonality and a modest improvement in production and capital markets benefiting from cre production continuing to slide we show the trend in adjusted non interest expenses of million for the quarter expenses remain wellcontrolled and we generated positive linkedquarter operating leverage on slide we present our credit trends which reflect the quality of both our commercial and consumer portfolios total net chargeoffs were basis points and a low basis points excluding basis points related to pcd loans the nonperforming loan ratio increased basis points due mostly to four borrowers in unrelated sectors that we are actively monitoring the third quarter allowance for credit losses to total loans including the reserve for unfunded commitments was basis points up basis points from the prior quarter risk rating migration over the last several quarters has been driven by the effects of higher interest rates and a more conservative posture in our risk rating framework while the grade migration has resulted in an increase in our quantitative reserves our total qualitative reserves are unchanged from the prior quarter qualitative reserves now incorporate a weighting on the moodys s2 scenario with additional qualitative factors to capture the possibility of further grade migration this is logical as greater conviction comes into focus that a hard landing scenario is unlikely moreover the s2 scenario assumes an unemployment rate that is higher than current levels and negative gdp also we remind you that our allowance for credit losses plus the discount remaining on acquired loans to total loans now stands at nearly basis points slide presents key credit metrics relative to peers as you can see our proactive approach to credit monitoring has led to above peer levels of npls but delinquency and chargeoff ratios that are well below peer averages over time we have long practiced conservatism and we continue to believe that the results speak for themselves on slide we review our capital position at the end of the quarter all ratios increased driven by strong retained earnings in addition the rate environment further aided tce build slide includes updated details on our rate risk position and net interest income guidance nii is expected to increase modestly in the fourth quarter our assumptions are listed on the slide but i would highlight a few of the primary drivers first we assume two rate cuts of basis points each consistent with the forward curve second we are now anticipating a declining rate total deposit beta of approximately and a noninterest bearing to total deposit mix that remains stable at we continue to believe that we have positioned the balance sheet well and we have maintained our neutral rate risk position slide includes our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year of you can see the details in the chart but it is worth pointing out that our full year outlook for preprovision net revenue remains unchanged from the initial expectations we shared with you in january of this year and our outlook proved more durable than many peers full year loan growth and nii are expected to be right in line with those original expectations while higher fee income is expected to be partially offset by higher noninterest expenses net chargeoffs are in line with our original range while provision expenses slightly higher than originally expected as a result of grade migration driven by our proactive approach to credit management in summary yeartodate results have been excellent with third quarter results in line with our expectations and strong performance metrics more old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 importantly we continue to demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategic priorities first we are driving organic deposit growth to fund our asset generation second our adjusted return profile remains top quartile against peers at on tangible common equity third we remain disciplined on expenses driving positive operating leverage and an adjusted efficiency ratio of fourth our borrowers remain resilient as evidenced by nonpcd net chargeoffs of just basis points and we believe we have ample reserve coverage along with a welldiversified and granular loan book and fifth we are continuing to rapidly compound tangible book value per share which was up yearoveryear with those comments wed like to open the call for your questions question and answer section operator and thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question and id just like to james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning scott good to hear from you r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey likewise you too thank you so i just wanted to one john appreciate the comments on sort of the full year nii i guess the fourth quarter in particular the expectation maybe a little lighter than what we had hoped days ago the fact that its sort of just a function of what happened with the belly of the curve since then as well as the different timing of the fed moves but would love to hear in your words any anything that has changed and then i know you touched on like the billion of cash flows over the next months if you could maybe offer any updated thoughts on sort of how powerfully the nii base could advance from the fourth quarter expectation and just sort of main levers additionally that you would see allowing it to do so john v moran iv a chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp perfect yeah hey scott your suspicion is right on on the nii guide really its a touch on the fiveyear point of the curve belly of the curve being a little bit lower is driving that outlook and then on securities roughly billion in cash flow coming off of that book over the next months pick up there about basis points against the back book so certainly thatll be helpful and we would anticipate plowing most of that just right back into the securities book at the margin there could be a touch if loan growth comes in stronger maybe we let that come in just a little bit but i think most of that will go back into securities at this point r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 okay perfect and then maybe if you john if you could expand a little on some of the reserving comments just in particular trying to get my arms around why credit costs are a little higher this quarter and expected to be so at least relative to what i would have anticipated next quarter is this something that will continue for a little while or is it kind of a transitory catch up how should we think about those sort of dynamics john v moran iv a chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah i think its just normalization of credit here i think for the year we sort of tightened the range on the guidance but its still i think at the beginning of the year we were saying to basis points on chargeoffs were now sitting at basis points to basis points on chargeoffs so i dont think that theres any real difference in our expectation around loss content and the provision that you saw in the quarter was kind of covering chargeoffs and building a little bit of reserve r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you guys very much james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks scott operator and your next question comes from the line of brendan nosal with hovde group your line is open brendan nosal q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning folks hope youre doing well james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks brendan brendan nosal q analyst hovde group llc maybe just to start off here looking a little further out on kind of the margin and nii dynamics i heard your comments again this quarter on a relatively rate neutral balance sheet positioning maybe just offer some thoughts on how you expect the nim to traject across if we end up getting the forward curves like lets say basis points or so of cuts by the end of next year thanks john v moran iv a chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah brendan i think i think what youre seeing here is kind of bottoming in probably up a little bit but our bias would be up a little bit i think our bias in was kind of stable to down a little bit and that played out right i think as we look out into deinverting in the yield curve and continued growth in the underlying franchise are going to be helpful for us and look i think thats helpful for us its helpful for the whole industry right so i think thatll be the key factor next year old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 brendan nosal q analyst hovde group llc okay perfect perfect maybe one more from me just kind of looking at the chargeoff rate on the expcd kind of core loan book seeing a little bit higher numbers over the past two quarters just wondering how you would characterize that is that still well within the framework of normalization off of a low base or is it indicative of perhaps some gradual weakening james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp no i think you hit the nail on the head with your first option brendan which is its normalization of credit were still well within our guidance as john said we started the year at basis points to basis points were now basis points to basis points for the full year and so as credit normalizes i think thats just what youre seeing brendan nosal q analyst hovde group llc all right fantastic thank you for taking the questions james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks brendan operator and your next question comes from the line of ben gerlinger with citi your line is open james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp hey ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good morning guys good morning james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc can you guys talk through your appetite for kind of hiring and where you might be targeting and its more so obviously a read and maybe a question but again like from a balance sheet perspective you seem pretty well situated for the current rate outlook and just kind of appetite on hiring and any trends you might want to highlight mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 hey ben its mark i would answer it in this way i think were open and opportunistic but we dont need to do anything really we like the team that we have we think we can outgrow industry loan growth i think our deposit performance growth performance has been terrific and all of our teams are focused on that so i dont think we need to do anything but we will continue to look to opportunistically fill in good talent we say it all the time it pays for itself quickly and so if people come along but were also watching expenses closely and so were not looking to add talent unless just that great opportunity comes along james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah i might add on top of that as we think about talent acquisition were particularly paying attention to our fee income businesses if you think about treasury management you think about our wealth management businesses those are businesses that again have a little bit longer earn back on the hires but we think are the right longterm investments for us particularly as we just transition to sort of larger institution have more opportunities in that space and so thats an area as mark says we have plenty of balance sheet growth and dont feel like we need to have more relationship managers there to grow the balance sheet however on those fee income businesses there will be continued opportunities for us to be successful benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats helpful and then when you think about the integration and going forward kind of lets call it the southeast kind of is there any additional cost savings now that you kind of have the integration in place you kind of have your lay of the land anything that you would want to potentially call as incremental more positive on growth or thoughts on additional expense cuts just now that you have your feet indiscernible here john v moran iv a chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp no no i think youll see the full run rate reflected in in terms of the saves that we highlighted for capstar just to remind you those are around million annually and we expect that thatll be fully realized in the fourth quarter i think if anything were looking to invest in that market its a great market and i dont know if mark would add or jim would add james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah i would just add that we spent a lot of time down there seems like im down there a few times a month and its unique in our core legacy midwestern markets oftentimes were part of the economic engines that are making those communities successful and down in nashville and tennessee broadly really you just have to be there theres just plenty of organic growth opportunities for us and we need to be in a position to take advantage of that and so as john said i think well continue to invest there its unlike any other part of our franchise where the economic growth is still incredibly strong benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats helpful color appreciate it thanks guys james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 thanks ben operator and your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning everyone maybe john lets start with a question for you does the million guide for nii in the fourth quarter does that assume million of accretion and then how are you thinking about the deposit beta over the next several quarters i know on the slide you said total deposit beta by the end of this year but whats your insight beyond the end of john v moran iv a chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah so the accretion piece yeah roughly stable so you got the right number there for in terms of beta i think probably allows us still some room to play offense and weve been unapologetic about that were on our front foot with respect to client acquisition and we really want to continue to fund organically our loan growth i think where well get the most beta and weve been saying this for a couple quarters now and its playing out exactly as we had expected is really in that exception price book and there we expect to see roughly ph down beta and weve been able to move that very quickly in fact when the when the fed moved basis points ph mike lloyd and team had program a and program b one was ready to go for basis points one was ready to go for basis points when we got basis points they pressed the button and that went in that afternoon right and so were ready to move very very quickly and well remain agile terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then as a followup could you discuss any common themes among the increase in nonaccrual loans i think there was four specific borrowers as well as the increase in classified loans and anything to do with the recent shared national credit exam that showed up in third quarter results mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah ill take those in reverse terry its mark given the environment we moved to a more conservative posture in our risk rating framework this year which drove that negative migration overall were now looking at our primary source of repayment debt service coverage almost exclusively in our risk ratings and so as borrowers have absorbed a full year of the 500basis point increase in rates coverage ratios have tightened particularly in cre we still feel good about secondary sources of repayment guarantors and collateral so but these sources no longer factor into our risk ratings but they obviously influence loss content which we still believe is generally low across our special mention and substandard loans specifically to the nonaccruals there were four larger credits when i say larger you got to think about that relatively speaking larger for us now those four credits were all in the million to million range so each one is a manageable level each was on our radar screen before they moved into nonaccrual and again thats just reflective of our granular portfolio i think one was a downgrade from the snc exam a ci credit out of the capstar portfolio the other three were different segments of cre so no trend no geography just unique issues to each individual credit and again ill just say like most of our nonperforming book i think theres decent underlying value in the real old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 estate and demand for those properties so even though our nonaccruals are up our chargeoff guidance hasnt moved we think in  well still be in that to basis points terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks mark and thanks for taking my questions james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks terry operator and your next question comes from the line of jared shaw with barclays your line is open jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning thanks maybe just looking at the guide for fee income it sort of looks like its implying an million decline versus third quarter anything specifically driving that or is that just a little bit of seasonality and how should we be thinking about sort of the jumping off point as we look next year on fee income john v moran iv a chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah hey jared yeah it was i think a little bit seasonality in some of the lines that are subject to that right mortgage will probably be a little bit softer in the fourth quarter capital markets had a really strong i dont know that i would that i would necessarily count on that one run rating and then in other there was a couple of little things that kind of broke our way in that i dont know are necessarily run ratable jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks and then how should we be thinking about your thoughts and view on capital build here it certainly seems like were going to continue to see capital building especially cet1 plenty of capital for the organic growth side is there an opportunity to supplement that with buybacks or any other capital actions john v moran iv a chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah so cet1 were starting to ph reap and were going to rebuild capital very quickly right left unchecked well ph take on basis points plus or minus a year on that ratio so i think as we get into next year and certainly theres an opportunity to kind of think about buyback were a little bit sensitive to earn back on that every quarter we kind of talk about dividend with the board so jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 thanks jared operator and your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning jim or john positive operating leverage you talked about a lot and you talked about your low efficiency ratio how do we think about just the cadence of those with the forward curve and the investments in the growth any material change as we get into mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp no i think we just keep running the playbook and to the extent that we have the ability were obviously sensitive to our expenses and we know hopefully some of that expense base is inside our control as you know though chris weve really been trying to manage for the longterm here and want to continue to invest in ourselves both from a risk management governance perspective but also from a offensive relationship management perspective and were going to continue to make those type of investments but i am sensitive to revenue growth to help offset any of those investments we make and sometimes the investments we make i mean as we talked about some of the fee income businesses the returns are a little bit longer than maybe some of the other businesses like the balance sheet but weve done a pretty good job of managing those tradeoffs and expect us to continue to make those same types of calls in christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks for that any use of capital is related to your fee income initiatives or and even a deal into next year mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp no no i dont see anything i dont see anything come in the future thats material of any nature but again we just know that thats an area as i think about treasury management wealth management we have the right to win and clearly mortgage is mortgage and theres been some volatility around that and we like the like the production will ramp today and hopefully itll continue to grow but i think its at an inflection point around the kind of 30year rate but those two other businesses treasury and wealth are ones that we have the right to win we have some longterm gains we have high expectations around the growth of those businesses and were going to continue to build in those businesses specifically christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks chris old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 operator and your next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james your line is open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks good morning everyone james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc as youre talking about as youre talking about the positive operating leverage and that being a goal how does that revenue growth impact how quickly you may invest in say tennessee where you see some great growth opportunities do you need to have positive operating leverage or can you if revenue growth maybe doesnt come in are you still going to put the dollars forward in that market james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah i think thats an area weve got to continue to invest and that is again like i said earlier the growth dynamics there are unlike any other part of our franchise where we we have low share obviously but theres high growth in other parts of our market we have low share and maybe the growth in total is not as high so i think we will prioritize investments in that newer part of our franchise and i would say continuing in some of our expansion markets as well those are going to be key continued investments and i would rather give up a little bit on the expense side for kind of longerterm growth and i think weve been able to kind of navigate those tradeoffs on a pretty adept basis and continue to deliver our earnings and return profile that you all expect david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks jim and then my second question is related to loan growth and as far as customer demand what do you think are the biggest catalysts out there in the marketplace to increase commercial customer loan demand mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah dave its mark i think just removal of uncertainty right as the soft landing is becoming a little bit more coming clearing the focus i guess people i think are the cautiousness that weve seen is starting to abate a little bit and then people just kind of hang on the election stuff and they want to get past the election and so yeah they just talk a lot about that and not that theyre frozen but i think its making people a little more hesitant so i think once we get a little more clarity on those two issues youll indiscernible that said youre starting to see activity and people refinance some things out in the cre markets youre seeing longer term lenders take things out at a pretty aggressive rate so youre starting to see there is sources out there and demand needs to catch up a little bit james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 david i would add mark and jim have done an excellent job kind of leading us through this different environment since the spring of and our expectations have definitely risen in terms of what we want full relationships deposit growth so i think that client selection has played a really important part of maybe an all but slower quarter for the third quarter than we see in the back half of the year or the first half of the year but that was quite intentional we want to ensure that we hit our hurdle rates in terms of the economic pricing and that we bring the full relationship to the table and were much less willing to bet that it will come and we want to make sure its there upfront david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay thanks mark thanks jim appreciate the insight james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks david operator and your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just as a quick followup on that is it more competitive do you think youre talking about riskadjusted return hurdles on lending but is it more competitive is that whats driving your intentional comment or is it something else james a sandgren a chief executive officercommercial banking old national bancorp hey jon this is jim sandgren no i think were starting to see the competitive pressures just picking up a little bit over the last quarter so were still fighting and we have the right to win in all the spaces that we do business in because of our relationships so but its picking up both on the lending side and the deposit gathering side so again i like our chances we like our chances to win and were doing just that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay thank you on that john maybe for you on the i like that exception pricing chart the one on slide and then as well but how quickly is that gap closing and would you say the reasons for the initial exception pricing have faded quickly or maybe are no longer there old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 john v moran iv a chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp i think we can close the gap and look clearly weve sort of crested here on both total deposits and the exception book but again jon i mean were going to stay on offense i mean if somebody else is out there flashing a down beta i view that as old nationals opportunity i think were very much interested in continuing to have deposits keep pace with our loan generation and so still putting on good spread right and as long as thats the case well stay on offense on deposits jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right and then last one on credit again maybe hard to answer this but when i look at the delinquency and nonperforming trends i think theyre still obviously manageable but whats the signal you want to send us are you expecting the growth to flatten out to continue to go up a little bit over time or are you seeing some of this stuff start to crest as you look forward thanks mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp jon this is mark ill start with delinquencies that bumped a little bit this quarter based on the capstar conversion its really an administrative issue so that i think is a nonevent honestly i think thatll come its still at a decent level now and itll come back down in  john v moran iv a chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp relative to further risk rating migration i mean we could still see some i mean its possible but i think our potential problems are wellknown and closely monitored and so while we could still see some downgrades i think there is a lot of things thatll mitigate the downgrade activity frankly our conservative and proactive approach in identifying them early this expectations for a soft landing which were starting to see manifest itself already in some upgrades as well interest rate cuts and just our aggressive efforts to reduce that book so again we could see some but i think well manage it well jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you very much james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks jon operator operator instructions and we will take a followup question from scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thanks i just had sort of a toplevel or strategic question jim as you build capital so quickly just hoping to get any updated thoughts on how ma might fit into the picture last quarter i recall getting the impression that deals old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2024 were not high on the list of preferences but as you look ahead would the preference be to stay on the path of increasing tangible book value or would we look to deploy some of that into any acquisitions james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah i think what weve said is any future ma opportunities really have a high hurdle and as weve tried to convey weve got plenty of organic growth opportunities today that we just need to execute on however to the extent that there are opportunities that come along and exceed those very high hurdles we have in place i think all of our shareholders want us to look at those things opportunistically but at the end of the day we are very focused on longterm shareholder value creation and anything we look at has to to meet those pretty high hurdles we put in place r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you very much james c ryan iii a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thank you for the question scott operator and there are no further questions at this time id like to turn the call back to jim ryan for closing remarks james c ryan iii chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp well we appreciate your participation and as usual the team
