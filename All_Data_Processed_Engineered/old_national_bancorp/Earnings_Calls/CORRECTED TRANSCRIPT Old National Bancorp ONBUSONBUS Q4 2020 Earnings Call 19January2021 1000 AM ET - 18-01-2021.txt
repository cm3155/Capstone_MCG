year i hope this call finds all of you and your families safe and healthy we are really pleased with our fourth quarter and fullyear results despite all the challenges that came our way this last year we stayed focused on the health and safety of our team members we successfully executed the onb way transformation and we remain dedicated to serving our clients and communities old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 we also continued to invest in new talent and further strengthen our client experiences with technology im pleased to say that weve delivered on the run rate savings we promised from the onb way as a result of the onb way ftes and branches are lower by each and we were able to reduce other overhead cost we were also able to achieve better than trend line growth from our commercial segment in and we plan to execute additional ideas in to drive higher revenue starting on slide our highlights include earnings per share of when adjusted for the onb way charges earnings per share were adjusted return on average tangible common equity was adjusted operating leverage improved by basis points and our adjusted efficiency ratio was we also set several new records during including the following record commercial loan production record mortgage production record capital markets revenue and obviously we had strong efficiency and core deposit growth next on slide our fourth quarter earnings per share was per share adjusted eps was i was particularly pleased with our quarterly loan production of billion endofperiod commercial loans excluding ppp loans increased on an annualized basis the loan growth was split equally between ci and cre growing our loan portfolio and improving our earning asset mix will help us preserve net interest income endofperiod core deposits increased by driven by checking and savings account growth we did have a small net recovery this quarter but maintained the overall reserve we continue ph to use qualitative factors to offset improvements in the economic data believing that theres still a fair amount of uncertainty with the economy and the pandemic net interest income excluding ppp increased because of the loan growth and better mix noninterest income was down slightly due to seasonal declines in mortgage but held up better than previous fourth quarters most of our reported credit quality metrics were relatively benign during the quarter but as we have previously stated we expect the credit metrics could worsen and losses will ultimately materialize after any stimulus and deferral programs run their course we continue to proactively downgrade some of the most pandemicexposed loans into the watch asset quality ratings and are still meeting weekly to review credit quality loanbyloan we continue to believe that our historically strong and consistent underwriting practices our diverse and granular loan portfolios and our midwest footprint should help us weather the impact better than most im really excited about the team members weve hired during we continue to have a good pipeline of opportunities too we have a great story to tell and we have strong interest from people wanting to join our team we have hired and expect to hire more in wealth management private banking commercial treasury management and key support team members as we disclosed last quarter these hires will cost us approximately million yearoveryear but should ultimately lead to higher revenue from these growth initiatives a quick thought about our capital we plan to maintain our buyback authorization throughout the year we will balance the benefits of buybacks versus ma opportunities i suspect there will be ma opportunities that will present themselves during the year we are getting more comfortable that we could put a credit mark on somebody elses loan portfolio but we will continue to be an active looker and a selective buyer with those remarks i will now turn the call over to brendon old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 brendon falconer senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you jim turning to the quarter on slide our gaap earnings per share was and our adjusted earnings per share was adjusted earnings excludes million in onb wayrelated charges moving to slide we are pleased with our fullyear adjusted pretax preprovision net revenue which was higher yearoveryear and despite the challenging operating environment we generated basis points of positive operating leverage slide shows the trend in outstanding loans and earning asset mix endofperiod loans decreased slightly quarteroverquarter driven by payoff of million in ppp loans excluding the impact of ppp endofperiod commercial loans increased million driven by record commercial production of billion the strong commercial growth this quarter was aided by higherthanaverage pullthrough rates and funding levels were also pleased with our loan growth mix this quarter which is wellbalanced between ci and cre production yields were slightly lower quarteroverquarter which was a result of a few larger highcredit quality clients with relatively low coupons but strong riskadjusted returns the billion quarterend pipeline reflects typical seasonal declines as well as the unusually high pullthrough rates of our record third quarter pipeline we believe the current pipeline with over million in the accepted category should lead to another good quarter of production the investment portfolio also increased in the quarter as deposit growth outpaced loan growth we are taking a disciplined approach of putting asset liquidity to work including adding some protection if rates were to rise lower rates on new purchases continue to impact our total portfolio yield which is down basis points to moving to slide periodend and average deposits increased during the quarter by and respectively growth was largely concentrated on our existing personal checking accounts but we were also continuing to win new deposit relationships in the business and public segments that added meaningfully to this quarters growth turning to pricing our total cost of deposits declined from basis points in the fourth quarter to basis points in  both time deposits and borrowing costs were meaningfully lower in the quarter and will continue to fall but at a moderate pace overall we are pleased with our deposit repricing efforts that have resulted in a significant reduction in deposit costs while maintaining our core client base next on slide you will see details of our net interest income and margin net interest income increased million quarteroverquarter largely due to an increase of million in ppprelated interest and fees from the forgiveness of approximately million in loans excluding the impact of ppp net interest income increased million quarteroverquarter due to strong commercial loan growth and active management of our funding costs the net interest margin also benefited from ppp fees adding an additional basis points over prior quarter core margin excluding accretion and ppp was in the fourth quarter compared to in  this basispoint decline was inline with our expectations and was partly the result of a lower new business rates i referenced earlier however we also experienced a significant uptick in liquidity and that while neutral to net interest income has put additional pressure on net interest margin future ppp payoffs coupled with stable deposit balances could amplify this impact in despite these pressures on margin we expect earning asset growth to help stabilize net interest income slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income adjusted noninterest income of million in the fourth quarter was slightly lower than the million we recorded in  the million dollar decline was primarily old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 driven by seasonal factors in our mortgage business despite the slight decline mortgage revenues outperformed our expectations with a record fourth quarter production of million and a record endofyear pipeline of million that is more than double the yearend level our capital markets also had another strong quarter posting million in revenues a million increase over prior quarter next slide shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses adjusting for onb wayrelated charges and tax credit amortization noninterest expense was million the increase in expenses was largely driven by incentive accruals that reflects the outstanding financial performance also impacting this quarters expenses was the timing of miscellaneous professional fees and community investments several smaller items make up the remainder of the quarteroverquarter variance and are not expected to recur given the number of moving parts this quarter we thought it would helpful to provide additional detail on our  expense expectations reductions in incentives and other expenses along with the typical adjustments for seasonal payroll taxes should result in noninterest expense of approximately million in the first quarter merit increases will go into effect in april and will not impact expenses until  we also want to provide a brief recap on the top saves we outlined as part of our onb way strategic plan we have delivered on the million in annualized expense save we promised in including million in personnel costs and million in branch and facilities expenses we are also beginning to see the results of our revenue initiatives particularly in the recent abovetrend growth in commercial loans and capital markets revenues additional revenue initiatives in our wealth and treasury management segments are well underway and we look forward to discussing the results of these projects as they progress as i wrap up my comments here are some key takeaways we are very pleased with the results of the quarter and the fullyear record commercial loan production led to significant earning asset growth our mortgage and capital market businesses finished a record breaking year with a strong fourth quarter and we delivered on the promised onb way expense savings with that i will turn it over to daryl to discuss credit daryl d moore chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp thank you brendon first update i would like to provide this morning is likely our last update around the first round of our client relief programs as they continue to wind down with respect to deferrals we have previously reported that we granted some type of deferral on slightly less than billion in loans which represented approximately of the portfolio at the end of this most recent quarter the dollar amount of loans still in deferral mode had dropped to million which represents roughly onehalf of of the total portfolio while we are still receiving deferral requests on the consumer side we dont feel that they are outsized given the current environment deferral requests on the commercial side has slowed to a trickle especially after the announcement of the new stimulus aid package as you know we were very successful in securing round one ppp funds for our clients having originated just short of loans with balances in excess of billion as of yearend we had roughly ppp loans with a balance of million remaining on the books from round one of the program as of late last week we had submitted over ppp loans for forgiveness representing slightly more than billion in balances of those submissions roughly of them totaling million have been approved and paid by the sba in addition of the forgiveness submissions of those represented loans greater than million in total we originated only of these higher dollar loans and it is encouraging to note that we did receive our first old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 approval for forgiveness for this particular set of loans last week remaining fees on ppp loans not yet taken into income totaled million slide lays out trends in the most significant credit quality indicator categories delinquencies fell in the quarter to basis points of the total portfolio decreases in both our ci and residential mortgage portfolios were noted in the quarter while we continue to see a somewhat increasing trend in our indirect auto portfolio delinquencies with respect to chargeoffs we posted a net recovery in the quarter of basis points resulting in a fullyear chargeoff rate of basis points nonperforming loans increased in the quarter as was expected increases in this category continue to come in great part from the downgrade of relationships that have shown weaknesses prior to the pandemic to put it in another way aside from loans that had reflected weakness prior to the onset of the pandemic and other than our relatively small hotel exposure we have not yet seen a meaningful migration of other credit relationships into our nonperforming category the first round of stimulus payments certainly helped in this regard and we expect the second round to also provide assistance i do want to be clear though that we are obviously seeing the migration of credits that were not in a significantly weakened position coming into the year into the special mention and substandard accruing categories as a result of the current economic challenges but this might lead us to summarize that the rate of future inflows of credits into the nonperforming category may likely be highly dependent upon both the ability of the us to roll out vaccinations in an efficient and timely manner as well as the length of time it will take us consumers to return to their prepandemic spending routines obviously the longer it takes to get back to prepandemic state the more room our borrowers will have experienced financial difficulties we believe that in the near term a continuing increase in risk assets is certainly a possibility slide sets out those industries we have identified as deserving an extra level of attention in this current economic environment there has been nominal change in our exposure to these industries which remains at roughly of total loans as we mentioned last quarter while there is merit in acknowledging that these industries as a whole may be suffering disproportionately in the current environment it is important to note that we will originate new credits in these categories to the right borrowers and for the appropriate purposes the chart at the bottom of slide shows the breakout of our consumer portfolio along with corresponding average fico scores this portfolio has shown little change as well since our last presentation to you we do continue to watch our consumer portfolio closely we will persist in our endeavors to work with borrowers who have lost their jobs during the pandemic and we believe that the new round of financial stimulus should help us in that regard as a final comment i think it is fair to admit that the results which we posted over the last few quarters are not what we had feared they might be back in march first of all our expectations were that we would have seen a much more significant downward migration of loans into the nonperforming category i think that the combination of government stimulus programs costcutting efforts by our borrowers and creative retooling by many of our clients have been key to keeping more borrowers from financial default while the impacts of the pandemic are lasting longer than any of us may have initially anticipated were hopeful that the second round of stimulus will go a long way to bridging our borrowers through to the end of the pandemic how and when losses manifest themselves in remains very uncertain we expect that loss rates will be old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 higher in but the magnitude of those increases again has much to do with how quickly we can return to economic recovery second the level of growth has exceeded our marked expectations as well i think that some of that growth may have to do with the quality of our loan book going into the recession which allowed us to not have to solely focus on the immediate crisis at hand and take a longer view with respect to working with clients both existing and new the sudden nature of this downturn and the likelihood that the recovery will be speedy once the vaccines have taken hold has permitted us to work with borrowers with an eye on postrecovery prospects if we had had to have been more inwardly focused on cleaning up a big share of our book at the outset of the downturn i suspect that our success levels in generating new loans would have been much diminished i believe that in we continued to underwrite loans in improved fashion and that we did not take on extraordinary risk in order to generate the loan growth we have posted with that ill turn the call back over to brendon brendon falconer senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you daryl on slide you will see the details of our fourth quarter allowance of million which was unchanged from  the improving economic forecast derived from moodys baseline led to a million decrease in reserve needs we added a similar offsetting amount for qualitative reserves that reflects the ongoing uncertainty of the economy and the chargeoff timing although the economic outlook continues to improve we believe its prudent to maintain a reserve level until we have more clarity on the path of the virus vaccination rollout and the efficacy of the latest stimulus package excluding ppp balances or allowance the loan ratio was basis points and is an appropriately conservative estimate of the credit risk in our portfolio today wed also like to remind you that we continue to carry million in unamortized marks from our acquired portfolios while these marks will not directly offset chargeoffs any remaining mark will accrete through margin upon resolution slide includes thoughts on our outlook for we ended the quarter with a healthy albeit seasonally lower billion commercial pipeline which includes million in the accepted category expected core earning asset growth and reduced funding costs should lead to stable net interest income but net interest margin could come under pressure from additional excess liquidity the ppp loan forgiveness process continues to go well and we expect runoff and the recognition of the related million in unamortized fees will be concentrated in the firsthalf of we expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well we are encouraged by the great momentum in mortgage evidenced by the strong year end pipeline but performance will still be subject to industry trends the strong commercial activity and rate environment should help maintain the high level of performance in our capital markets business deposit service charges continue to lag historical levels and the promise of additional stimulus could further delay the return of this revenue other fee lines are expected to be stable in the near term as our onb way revenue initiatives in wealth and treasury management takes shape later in the year we provided guidance on  expense of million which includes the investments in talent we discussed last quarter in our wealth and commercial segments as well as some additional marketing and technology spend old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 lastly a brief update on taxes as we previously reported a couple of large historic tax credit projects were placed in service in  these projects accounted for most of the increase in tax credit amortization in the quarter with a net income benefit of approximately million regarding we expect a reduction in the volatility caused by our tax credits as we worked through the last of the remaining oneyear historical tax credit commitments in total we are expecting approximately million in tax credit amortization for the year with a corresponding fullyear effective tax rate of approximately with that we are happy to answer any questions that you may have and we do have the full team here including jim sandgren question and answer section operator operator instructions the first question comes from the line of ben gerlinger with hovde group ben t gerlinger q analyst hovde group hey good morning guys james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning ben how are you ben t gerlinger q analyst hovde group im doing well you guys seemed to have a pretty solid so congratulations on that i was wondering if you guys could take a step back and to get a little bit of a bigger picture on the onb way was largely focused on expense management and you guys did a lot of heavy lifting throughout the year and then was kind of scheduled to have a lot more of that revenue growth granted when you guys released the plan a lot of events have taken place since then around the world so i was wondering if you guys could just talk around potential timing of when things could come to fruition in terms of revenue any opportunities that you might see now that there has been some disruption in the market that you guys currently have your footprint in james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp i think those are all good observations ben and many of the commercial treasury and wealth management initiatives are just kind of full steam ahead its really about putting the right talent in place to go out and execute those and theres some technology improvements particularly in our treasury management business that well continue to work on throughout the year and we knew it was going to take the better part of to really implement those initiatives get those people onboard hired and trained up old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 and there are some initiatives around small business and some consumer initiatives that quite frankly were not quite ready to put in place but we continue to build the technology to support those initiatives so those are a little bit longer runway than we anticipated if we had a more normal economy we would have anticipated executing those this year but having said that a big bulk of the treasury management commercial and wealth is just on pace and scheduled to happen throughout ben t gerlinger q analyst hovde group okay great thats helpful and then my other question jim came to the capital usage i know that your stocks have call it or so since the lows in like september october obviously in your prepared remarks you said that ma is much more of an opportunity and like obviously the math does work better with a better currency so i was curious on if you had any potential remarks about something going forward i know your past three acquisitions have been around billion or so and theyve been drifting towards the northwest with wisconsin and the minnesota i was wondering if you had any other thoughts on any geographies you might be looking into potential size if it differs from that billion mark and then finally if you thought about just the loan portfolio itself of that acquired bank is there any concentrations you might want to bulk up or is it a little agnostic to their loan portfolio james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp i think we continue to gravitate towards banks that have a similar business mix and model that we have we continue to be very comfortable in the midwest obviously and in terms of size those plan a opportunities continue to be that kind of to of assets but as weve always said were willing to think about other things if it strikes the right balance between shareholder accretion strengthening our company further i think all those things are going to be important to us and i will just say were not looking at a book today and get ready to announce a transaction anytime soon its just middle part of last year was pretty hard to imagine that you could put a credit market to somebody elses balance sheet were just getting more comfortable that you can define the scope of what you think the loss content might be and probably closing the gap between the bidask today than it was maybe six months ago so we just think there are going to be opportunities that are going to present themselves throughout the year and were going to be in a position to take advantage of those opportunities and continue to do deals like weve done in the past that we think makes sense for our shareholders and makes sense to continue further strengthen our company ben t gerlinger q analyst hovde group got you thanks thats all for me i appreciate the time and then congrats on a solid quarter and year james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks ben appreciate it operator the next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp mr siefers youre a little short this morning here you got beat out r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co jim i dont know what happened i mean if youre asking am i do i feel humiliated because im going to james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp no but ben is a little bit younger and he just had the edge on you this morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hes coming into his own i passed my peak its a sad day for me ill try to be less disappointing next quarter i appreciate you guys taking the question i wanted to just get some updated thoughts on loan growth we backed out the ppp and its just i mean its extraordinarily strong relative to what were seeing out of the ph eha data a lot of competitors et cetera just curious jim for your updated thoughts on how much of that is just your customers organic demand and how much of it is market share opportunities and where youre seeing most of that come from like geographically as well james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp ill give you my two seconds on it and im going to let jim maybe followup on it a lot of the growth we saw in the fourth quarter is really all that hard work weve done in the middle part of the year again as daryl said on his remarks and jim will continue to reiterate we stayed focused in on calling and jim and i went on a lot of client calls this summer and some of those were opportunities that were able to steal away from larger organizations and quite frankly made some policy changes that caught up some of their best clients and so we walked through those doors and some were longterm clients and a lot of it was just some existing opportunities that we had with clients and then some were new i mean it was really a mixture of all but ill let jim kind of follow up but we were really pleased that we really stayed focused throughout the whole year on those clients and because i think of our historically strong underwriting practices we werent scared that we were going to have some big mess to deal with we were able to really stay focused and keep our underwriting going james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah i think thats well said i think the commitment through the onb way to commit to segments and to really align our skill sets with what our customers need certainly helped out as well really from a production standpoint geographically minnesota again led the way were really pleased with the continued efforts of our minnesota rms and then continued to see strong growth from louisville and indianapolis among others so again a lot of the growth was throughout the footprint but kind of concentrated in those two areas old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 and while the pipeline is down a little bit seasonally and obviously huge production in the fourth quarter we feel good about first quarter i think our accepted category is about million higher than it was at this time last year plus we do have a number of commercial construction advances over million that are still left to be advanced on so i feel like we have some tailwinds but certainly our rms are committed to growing that pipeline as we typically do at this time so optimistic r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you for that color and then separately i know were still very early in this new round of ppp program but just curious what kind of demand are you guys seeing for it what role do you expect you guys will play et cetera just i guess any toplevel thoughts id just be curious james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah scott right now were really seeing some nice demand so we did a soft opening with our portal on friday already weve seen over applications average loan size is about our rms are doing a lot of very proactive outreach to our round one clients who took advantage were also doing a lot of focus on minorityowned womenowned businesses nonprofits so we anticipate a lot of demand obviously a smaller pool you have to show that reduction in revenues quarter over that being said i think were going to see a lot of opportunities not only to help our customers but to bring in some new clients to the bank so so far pretty good start james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah scott i mean on average we expect the loan balances to be relatively small i mean it is capped at million and so the total impact to our organization will be much smaller than the initial round but as jim said in terms of sheer numbers of loans i think therell be a fair amount of numbers of loans but the dollar size of those loans will be relatively small and the overall income impact will be much much smaller in than it was in r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah all right perfect thank you guys very much appreciate it james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks scott james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp thanks scott james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp better luck next time old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i know i know thank you again and again i am sorry operator the next question will come from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everybody brendon maybe just a clarifying question on the net interest income guide is that excluding can you tell me is that excluding both accretion and the ppp impact or is that one or the other brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah chris if youre referencing the that i talked about in my opening comments yes that excludes both all ppprelated interest and fees and accretion christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and so the outlook comment that suggested a little bit of pressure on margins but stable net interest income is that kind of the core core excluding both accretion and ppp brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yes absolutely christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and on that youve got a really low loandeposit ratio and youve had a lot of success with deposit growth how do i think about the borrowings that are on your balance sheet the need to keep them on the balance sheet this year and kind of balancing that loantodeposit against the loan growth outlook brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah chris great question we are looking for opportunities to continue to optimize the funding side of our balance sheet there are some leverage we can pull but i would not expect that number to change materially over the next several quarters christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay and then jim just going back to your ma question and comments before you talked about plan a being to i think in the past youve talked about prepandemic the willingness to do kind of a old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 transformational deal or more openness does that put in i guess play a potential moe if the stars aligned is that something the board will consider james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp look we have to do our fiduciary job if it makes sense for the shareholders and we think we can create long term value out of it we will absolutely consider it we need to be open to those things but we know how difficult they are and theyre going to have a higher bar for us given the execution risk around that but the board and management would absolutely consider if it was the right thing to do christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then just a couple of housekeeping could you just provide the remaining onetimers related to the onb way if there are any and then the million of ppp fees is that just the fees and then we should add on the coupon or is that all in revenues brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp chris this is brendon yeah so the ppp fees or the million is just the fees it does not include the interest impact for whatever was left in   regarding onb way we are wrapping up with most of the work around onb way there could be some de minimis amounts coming through in  and  but relatively small at this point christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay awesome thank you james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks chris operator the next question will come from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good morning everyone im used to coming after scott so nothing new on my end this morning but thanks for taking my questions first off i just want to make sure i understand the expense commentary i mean pretty straightforward the million for the first quarter so i guess my question is how much of that million yearoveryear increase from the new hires is in that million and if its not all in there how should we think about growing that number old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 and then same question for kind of the annual merit increase in the second quarter i think last call you maybe quantified that if you could just remind me the best way to think about that starting in thanks brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah we talked about a million impact for all the investments and so about a quarter of that is represented in your  number so the remainder of that will happen over the course of the year and in terms of merit its about million million per quarter beginning in  terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then just my followup here if i look at the reserve ratio at the end of the first quarter was call it basis points now over exppp loans once you have a little bit more clarity and certainty about the economic outlook and just feel more comfortable there do you think that ratio goes back to where it was you call it day or it was after the first quarter ended brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah terry i dont think it goes back to day i think the economic outlook that well experience at the end of this crisis will probably not be as rosy as it was back in january when we put it together so my guess is we ended a level higher than day but probably not meaningfully lower than we are today terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then just one last question i know this came up earlier given the acquisition that is occurring in some of your core markets and in some of the costsavings numbers that have publicly been talked about would you be interested maybe at the end of this year in really ramping up some of your hiring maybe in excess of what you were thinking about before that news happened and if so maybe what markets do you think present the best opportunity for that thank you james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp yes we will continue to be an opportunistic place to hire folks for and we have feelers out in all of our markets trying to look for the best possible talent theres still a fair amount of disruption from the largest banks in our footprint and sometimes its difficult to serve your clients and some of those organizations and so well continue to look for that and so while we know weve kind of quantified this initial round of hire really supporting the onb way initiatives we really continue to be an opportunistic hirer and i dont expect that hiring would have a material impact on our overall expense numbers so well continue to look for those great opportunities minnesota continues to ph represent great opportunities for us michigan continues to represent great opportunities for us louisville places like that continue to represent great opportunities so were absolutely willing to go off and hire in excess of our original plans if it makes sense for the longterm growth of the company terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 thats great thanks again james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks terry operator the next question will come from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning good morning brendon maybe a question for you on mortgage banking you talked about the pipeline being twice what it was a year ago but whats the message youre sending on some of the nearterm mortgage trends can you keep pace with the kinds of numbers you put up in the fourth quarter or do you expect that to fade a bit brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah jon no real clear message other than to say we ended the year really great so i think typically we should be able to outperform the  of last year just given the yearend pipeline but well not be immune to the headwinds and tailwinds of the mortgage business in aggregate i think our mortgage business will continue to follow those industry trends but i think well be off to a good strong start in  james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp as i think were finishing up last year i mean theres a fair amount of uncertainty can be as robust as and i think many of the models out there had a really strong in terms of mortgage fee income where the mba forecasts showed maybe down at one point in time so i think theyre just kind of balanced there i mean to be truthful were not quite sure what mortgage volumes will look like we were anticipating a down year but weve been calling that down year for the last few years to be honest with you so its hard to know we were just really pleased our fourth quarter ended really strong and hopefully well maintain some of the momentum going into the first quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay good fair enough and then back on the reserve just to followup the qualitative piece of it just curious if you could help us think through that what are maybe the top couple qualitative factors that maybe you cant get your arms around that caused that qualitative increase brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 i think jim daryl and i all mentioned it its really the path of this virus the vaccination rollout and maybe more importantly the timing of chargeoffs and the delayed recognition and until we have some clarity around that its challenging for us at this point to release reserves in a meaningful way jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and that kind of leads to my last one here to followup you talked a little bit about indirect auto delinquencies up a little bit and i guess thats maybe understandable with kind of the stimulus pause but have you seen any other new problems or anything unexpected and i understand the qualitative piece of it but anything new or surprising that youre seeing or is it just generally things are getting better daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp yeah jon daryl here no there really isnt anything in the portfolio weve got that slight increase in delinquencies in indirect if i had to search and search the only thing that is remotely surprising to us in our consumer portfolio is the defaults related to deaths and i dont think its covidrelated necessarily but weve tracked that over the last several years and at least in our portfolio we have some defaults related to that but as we look through the rest of the portfolios there really is not anything at this point time thats surprising to us which may in itself be surprising right jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc right okay okay and the general view is that the new stimulus generally helps to push out losses do you think daryl that all the stimulus and what were seeing and what youre thinking right now that all the stimulus that we have and is probably yet to come flattens the losses daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp yeah im maybe in a little different camp if the vaccinations cant take hold i think this next round depending how big it is could not only just push out losses it could also serve to reduce to a certain extent the loss content that we have in our portfolio so im a little more bullish on that james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp which is pretty rare for daryl jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i know im shocked but im on your camp daryl im in your camp i think its positive so okay thanks for all the help i appreciate it james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks jon operator operator instructions the next question will come from the line of david long with raymond james old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2021 james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone thanks for taking my question as it relates to commercial real estate curious if youre what youre hearing from your customers about how much how much space they will need going forward as we come out of this pandemic im not talking about the next three to six months but just over the course of the next couple of years if youre getting any insights as to customers needing to expand to create space or are they going to be looking to be cutting space because more people are going to be working at home just curious on anything youre picking up in your discussions with your customers right now james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah i think its david this is jim sandgren this i think its a little early to tell that whole kind of workfrom home and office are we dont have a huge exposure to office and weve been very cautious about that as we go into it but we continue to keep a close eye on retail multifamily weve had a lot of growth there i think were being very opportunistic making sure were doing the right deals in the right markets with the right borrowers but we continue to have those conversations but i think its still too early to tell exactly what that trend is going to be for businesses and workfromhome and how much office space youre going to need weve also heard the other side if a lot of people are working from home people may say hey we still need office space but we may need more office space for less people so again a lot of things going on right now were just kind of waitandsee how that all plays out james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp david i would just share anecdotal conversations ive had with ceos across our footprint and while everybody was talking about the virtues of working from home last year i think as the year started closing out there was a lot of ceos that had some fatigue around the workfromhome and the productivity around the workfromhome and maybe while it worked really early on its been more challenging here as of late and just the desire for people who are social by nature to get together and be more collaborative so i think theres balance in the conversation today i agree with jim its too early to tell about what happens to our portfolio but i dont think at the virtues that everybody is going to workfromhome and anywhere they want to work maybe in the midwest maybe different than maybe other parts of the country but i dont think that that will mean a big impact to old nationals portfolio david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks guys appreciate the color thats all that i have james c ryan iii a chairman and
