dorothy good morning everyone i hope this call finds all of you and your families safe and healthy while we are pleased with our first quarter core fundamental trends and the implementation of the onb way strategic initiatives our commitment and focus today is on supporting our clients team members and old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 communities id also like to thank our team members for their hard work and dedication to serving our clients and communities during this difficult time starting on slide our first quarter net income was million including million in onb way charges adjusted net income was higher at million which includes higher loan loss provisions for the first quarter adoption of cecl as you review our results youll see that our core margin was down due to the fed fund rate cuts and the challenging yield curve we were able to lower total deposit costs by basis points to basis points our commercial production of million was seasonally higher as a result of the good production lower payoffs and some higher quality line usage commercial loans grew over annualized we recorded million in provision expense during the quarter related to the adoption of cecl i suspect you will see wide variances in cecl provisions this quarter for midsized banks as we all adapted to this new standard and the multiple economic forecasts once we determined the accounting relief from cecl was very temporary and the regulatory capital relief was extended it made sense for us to proceed with adopting as of january the depth of this crisis is yet to be known i wont even speculate on future losses or provision needs but the impact is clearly very broad based the midwest having felt the same impact as other parts of the country and we are hopeful that relief programs we have put in place coupled with the various governmental programs will ultimately blunt the economic impact to our clients old national is celebrating our year in business as you know we pride ourselves on being a basic boring bank our loan portfolio is diverse its granular and overall is strong thats ever been heading into this crisis but we will need more time to better understand the magnitude of the economic impacts before truly understanding future losses we have run and shared with our board of directors multiple economic forecasts and various stress tests as a result we are still open for business and extending new credit we manage for the long term our balance sheet and capital are strong our markets are diverse and our experienced team will help manage us through this challenging time i am confident that we will emerge even stronger on the other side we were successful in making the organizational changes we revealed last quarter and we made significant progress on the efficiency initiatives under the onb way brendon will provide all the details but we are on track to deliver million in cost savings in and achieve the full million run rate in as we discussed on last quarters call we continue to make progress on the revenue initiatives but admittedly some of them have been reprioritized given the pressing need for investments in the various government relief programs and our own internal relief programs on the capital front we did repurchase million shares during the quarter at an average price of we did suspend our program given the uncertain economic conditions after reviewing the various stress tests with our board we dont anticipate any other capital actions and we expect to maintain our current dividend moving to slide we detailed our covid19 response for clients team members and communities the health and safety of our team members and clients is paramount we granted additional sick time for team members along with additional paid timeoff for all team members to assist with unforeseen personal needs we also expanded family and medical leave benefits to those who are atrisk or would have an atrisk person in their old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 household weve enabled many team members to work remotely daily we have more than team members working from home and lastly we expanded our one wish program for team members with unforeseen financial needs all our branches are open via drivethru with lobbies by appointment only we provided information on digital banking options and change in our service delivery model via oldnationalcom emails direct mail and social media platforms weve definitely seen healthy increases on our mobile and online platforms we are providing clients relief by approving payment extensions not reporting payment deferrals to credit bureaus and waving or refunding overdraft and monthly service charges for clients impacted by covid19 we continue to lend to qualified businesses for working capital and general business purposes weve helped nearly clients with the sba payment protection program and we are proactively reaching out to our clients in approving loan payment extensions today im pleased that we announced a million commitment to immediate and nearterm relief efforts for immediate needs with an emphasis on lowtomoderate income communities and for our foundation with a focus on longterm restoration as you can see on slide the covid19 impact to the states in our footprint has been less impactful than other parts of the country michigan has some of the highest reported case in our footprint with almost concentrated in the audio gap where we have no branches in our footprint business and governmental leaders are talking about safe ways to open businesses and return to work im optimistic that the midwest will be among the earliest to reopen scott evernham our chief risk officer and daryl moore our chief credit executives are joining us on the call today both are experienced in their roles and have many of the same leaders in their teams for the financial crisis we are fortunate to have daryls experience in this environment given hes been with old national for more than years he was really hoping to finish his career by never having to present slides in our earnings conference call again but im glad to have his experience today and i will now turn the call over to daryl daryl d moore chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp thank you jim slide gives us a high level of review of the composition of both our commercial and consumer portfolios while theres no denying that most industry segments have been negatively impacted by the covid19 outbreak weve outlined in the top chart for you the commercial industries that many believe will suffer disproportionately in this crisis over the years weve tried to identify those industry segments that are most volatile and do not perform well in a cycle and for the most part have attempted to either not participate in those segments or participated with appropriate structure and risk mitigation in place we certainly will not be immune to difficulties in these segments but as you can see the size of our exposure to these most vulnerable industries appears to be well managed going into the cycle with respect to our consumer loan book you can see in the chart in the bottomleft quadrant of the slide a breakout of the size and average fico scores of the different product types within our consumer portfolio going into the cycle theres no doubt that because of the significant increase in unemployment we will experience difficulties in this portfolio that none of us would have anticipated when we originated these loans but again old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 looking at the fico scores and the fact that less than of the portfolio could be considered subprime we believe that we are fairly well positioned to address any developing difficulties in this portfolio just a couple of comments about line utilization as reflected on the chart in the lower righthand quadrant we have seen an increase in commercial line utilization predominantly from clients with stronger asset quality ratings commercial line utilization at march was compared to at the end of the prior quarter weve also seen an increase in heloc applications within the last days with the quality of those applications generally being very strong while we are not able to definitively determine why we are seeing an uptick in this particular loan category we suspect that many of our consumer borrowers are following the lead of our commercial clients ph line of liquidity backup if the economy continues to be stressed for a more lengthy time period next we wanted to give you an idea of the volume of the loan deferral approvals we have granted and have laid out those along with some paycheck protection program information on slide on the commercial side we have approved roughly requests from borrowers totaling billion representing of total commercial outstandings while of the deferrals we have booked todate are in the cre loan category we expect to see this percentage drop as we continue to book approved requests as proportion of cre requests appears to have been higher early on in the deferral application process as you might suspect while the number of loan deferrals is higher in the consumer area the dollar amount of those deferrals and the portfolio penetration numbers are lower than in the commercial area as shown on the righthand side of the slide through the exhaustive work of many of our team members we have helped provide billion in paycheck protection program assistance to roughly borrowers slide provides a recap of credit trends from the first quarter results both nonperforming and underperforming loans fell slightly in the quarter to levels lower than we have posted at any quarter end in and lower than any yearend level in the past three years chargeoffs were higher in the quarter related to two particular credits we chose to take an additional writedown prior to the end of the quarter on a relationship that was the subject of our larger fourth quarter chargeoff being concerned about collateral values in this new economic environment we commissioned new appraisals and felt an additional writedown of million was appropriate the other larger chargeoff in the quarter was a million action on a credit we have been working with for an extended time period waiting on the investment of outside capital that have been promised by the borrower as we were not entirely certain that this capital investment would be made we chose to fully impair the loan for loan loss reserve purposes back in when it became apparent that the investment would not materialize by the end of the quarter and given the change in the economy we determined that a complete writeoff of the exposure was appropriate we will continue to pursue collection efforts on this relationship going forward at this point in time we do not feel these writedowns are reflective of any general precovid19 credit issues in the portfolio but represents isolated credit events that occur over time in any portfolio just a couple of comments before i end my part of this discussion about our approach to this newly changing environment over the years weve dealt with numerous economic cycles it has become apparent that an intentional clearly communicated plan with respect to how we will approach the challenge at hand is important to minimizing losses what we have found is the first item at hand is for everyone to recognize that economic conditions have changed in this current environment the pace and the breadth of this change is unparalleled while this sounds obvious and simple to accomplish we have to remember that just days ago most banks were in full new loan old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 production mode getting team members to switch for production indiscernible when necessary having tough conversations with clients about the new economic realities is vitally important and has to be accomplished quickly for the benefit of both the client and the bank in this new environment we are emphasizing at minimum we must evaluate the borrowers liquidity capital adequacy and availability and loan structure every time we touch a credit liquidity is the first concern of the bank and most borrowers in such times as these without the ability to continue to fund the basic necessities of the business and otherwise resourceful enterprise cant survive what is different about this downturn is the infusion of liquidity that the government is making through the paycheck protection program and other offerings while we are hopeful is yet to be seen whether the amounts our borrowers are able to draw under these programs are going to be at levels sufficient to bridge them through this challenge the adequacy and availability of the capital is the next concern we talk with our borrowers about to remember that or to remind them that capital is a reserve that they have to cover unanticipated setbacks if we do not believe that our borrowers have sufficient balance sheet capital to get them through the current setbacks we challenge them as to what outside resources they may have at their disposal to raise needed capital and encourage them to begin to line up those resources as a final point we require a review of the current loan structure and collateral support we are emphasizing that opportunities to strengthen structures in terms of guarantees and covenants must be considered and the acquisition of additional collateral if available has to be on the table in our discussion with our borrowers were also beginning to think about how the current challenges of shelter in place might have an impact on collateral values and ultimately loss given default assumptions foreclosures have been put on hold auto auction houses are not currently in operation in many locations courts are closed and i could go on its a time proven fact that in most instances collateral does not get more valuable with the passage of time in an economic downturn our collateral values and liquidation strategies play out has yet to be seen given the pentup demand may play a role in softening the risk associated with this potential issue i outlined these fairly obvious items because i believe that a banks discipline around these very basic fundamentals can make a difference to the ultimate performance of its portfolios finally i think its important to reaffirm that the bank embraces the vital role it needs to play in supporting each of our communities recovery efforts while focusing on the basic credit fundamentals ive addressed is critically important in this environment we also understand our obligation to provide credit at every responsible opportunity to help our clients and this country to get back on our feet my belief is that banks that understand how to properly balance these two imperatives will have every opportunity to be very successful as we come out of the cycle with that ill turn the call over to brendon brendon falconer senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you daryl before turning to the quarterly financials we would like to provide some additional color on our cecl allowance on slide our day cecl reserve of million was million over our yearend reserve and right in the middle of our projected range the relatively large indiscernible increase in reserves and million provision expense for the quarter were primarily driven by projected economic impact of the coronavirus the macroeconomic variables used in our models were derived in the moodys critical pandemic old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 forecast scenario published on march the scenario assumes a sharp decline in gdp in  and a return to growth by yearend the immediate increase in unemployment is less severe than current expectations but does remain elevated through the slide also outlines the key economic variables and portfolio inputs used in our models in addition to the quantitative inputs we also considered several qualitative factors in our final reserve assessment including the risk that the economic decline specifically unemployment and gdp prove to be more severe andor prolonged than our baseline forecast we also took into consideration the mitigating impact of the unprecedented fiscal stimulus including direct payments individuals enhanced unemployment benefits as well as various government sponsored loan programs which we expect will provide relief to consumer and commercial borrowers lastly as daryl reviewed we consider a relatively low exposure to the industries expected to be most vulnerable to this crisis the future severity of the economic fallout from this virus is yet unknown as is the ultimate effectiveness of the government response in providing a bridge for the individuals and businesses impacted as time goes on we will have more clarity on both and well adjust our reserve levels accordingly that said we believe our current reserve level reflects our best estimate of the credit losses in the portfolio today turning to the quarter on slide our gaap earnings per share was and our adjusted earnings per share was adjusted earnings per share excluded million in onb way related charges as well as million in debt securities gains moving to slide our quarterly adjusted pretax preprovision net revenue was higher yearoveryear and higher over prior quarter this result was driven by increased fee income led by our mortgage and capital markets businesses as well as a reduction in adjusted operating expenses resulting from our progress towards achieving the expected savings from onb way initiative despite the challenging operating environment we improved operating leverage by basis points yearover year we believe our strong pretax preprovision net revenue will provide a buffer against future provision needs slide shows the trend in outstanding loans end of period loans increased million quarteroverquarter largely in our commercial and commercial real estate loan categories the increase was driven by solid commercial loan reduction of million slowing prepayment speeds and higher line utilization the increase in line utilization was concentrated in our highest credit quality borrowers commercial activity was high during the first quarter which resulted in a sizable increase in our pipeline which currently stands at billion but given the current economic uncertainty we would expect pull through rates to be lower than recent quarters the full impact of the december rate cut on existing loans coupled with lower coupons on new production drove overall portfolio yields lower we expect a dramatic shift in the yield curve will continue to put pressure on asset yields in moving to slide both period and end average deposits decreased during the quarter due to seasonal declines in public fund operating accounts and modest cd runoff our total cost deposits declined basis points quarter overquarter to basis points we quickly reacted to the emergency rate cuts in march and ended the month at a very low basis points in total deposit costs time deposits rate averaged during the quarter but with approximately three quarters of our cd book maturing in the next months our interest expense should old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 continue to decline we are pleased with the results of our deposit pricing strategy that has resulted in a meaningful reduction in deposit costs while maintaining our core client base slide shows our first quarter earning asset mix and quarteroverquarter change in loan mix strong commercial loan growth this quarter supports our goal of remixing our balance sheet to more productive commercial and commercial real estate loans the investment portfolio yield was down just basis points quarter overquarter to with new purchases yield in next on slide youll see the detailed changes in our first quarter net interest income and corresponding margin strong earning asset growth contributed to our net interest income and we are pleased with the performance of the margins given the challenges of the interest rate environment net interest margin excluding accretion was slightly lower than our expectations at compared to last quarter however adjusting for the day impact and lower interest collected on nonaccrual loans core margin was down just basis points the reduction in core earning asset yields which were down basis points was nearly offset by reductions in our funding cost active repricing of our deposit book and balance sheet strategies continue to help mitigate the negative impact on margin slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income our first quarter adjusted noninterest income increased million the quarteroverquarter change was a result of an increase in mortgage banking revenue which was driven by strong production and healthy gain on sale margins but also benefited from a million change in our pipeline valuation we did take a million impairment charge to our msr portfolio this quarter that is netted against our mortgage revenue the capital markets line of business continues to be a bright spot as interest rate swaps continue to be very attractive to clients other key categories were generally stable but will likely come under pressure in the second quarter also included on this slide is a summary of our mortgage activities for the quarter which shows million in production low interest rates continued to support strong refi activity in the quarter which accounted for of our production next slide shows a trend in adjusted noninterest expenses which reflects our ongoing focus on expense management onetime charges were million this quarter which is slightly better than the million we projected adjusting for these onetime charges and tax credit amortization noninterest expense was down almost million quarteroverquarter and we remain on track to realize the expected savings from our onb way strategic plan its also worth noting that our  noninterest expense included a ceclrelated day adjustment to our allowance for unfunded commitments of million our adjusted efficiency ratio for the quarter is a low representing basis point improvement over  of as i wrap up my discussion on the quarter here are some key takeaways we are pleased with our overall performance as the fundamentals of our core business were strong as demonstrated by our improved pretax pre provision net revenue we posted annualized loan growth in the quarter without compromising on credit we defended the margin well in an increasingly challenging rate environment our fee businesses posted healthy revenue growth particularly in mortgage and capital markets and we delivered on the promised expense savings we outlined last quarter slide includes our thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of the covid19 virus will have a meaningful impact on our performance commercial loan activity was strong in the quarter and we entered old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 the second quarter with a healthy pipeline however nearterm economic uncertainty is expected to have a negative impact on pull through rates and may mute future loan growth ppp loans are expected to add billion to our outstandings in  but there are some uncertainty about how long these loans will stay on our balance sheet we have meaningfully mitigated the impact on our net interest margins to the short end of the curve but historically low longterm rates will continue to put pressure on asset yields as our loan and investment portfolio is repriced at lower coupons after repricing our deposit book has been a key component of our margin defense and while there is room to move deposit costs lower particularly within the cd portfolio most of the transaction account rate reductions are now behind us ppp loans will also impact our margin going forward these loans carry a coupon and an average fee of approximately that will be accreted through margin on a level yield over their twoyear terms as loans are paid off early any remaining fees will be accreted to income immediately several fee items will also likely come under pressure from the economic slowdown our wealth management and investment businesses have seen a decline in the valuation of our assets under management that will impact fees in the near term overdraft fees and interchange income were down sharply in the last week of march as consumers began to comply with shelter in place orders and limited their spending to essential services although weve seen a pickup in activity in early april were likely to stay below trend until the economy is reopened as i mentioned earlier the mortgage pipeline ended at record highs we can see but we could see increased fallout in the weeks to come a large driver of the mortgage revenue this quarter was related to our pipeline build that revenue typically reverses in the fourth quarter as pipelines decline but given the disruption in the housing market it may reverse more quickly we expect the remainder of to reflect the expense reductions associated with onb way that were communicated last quarter net of merit increases beginning in  we are now estimating total onetime charges in related to onb way to be million which is a decrease from the original estimate of million all of our expense initiative remained on track including the planned closure of branches by april wed also like to give you an update on our current capital position and outlook we ended the quarter with a healthy cet1 ratio of and in abundance of caution we have suspended our buyback program temporarily with any future use of the authorization dependent on the facts and circumstances present later in the year i would also reiterate that based on our current capital levels and our outlook on performance we believe we have the capacity to maintain our dividend weve also recently updated our stress test model and under the ccar severely adverse scenario we remain well capitalized at the lowest point in the ninequarter horizon our liquidity position also remains very strong with our low loantodeposit ratio of strong cash and unencumbered security position and various other sources of liquidity we have plenty of flexibility to respond to funding needs lastly we provided some guidance on our full year tax rate which is expected to be approximately on an fte basis and on a gaap basis the effective tax rate includes million in tax credits primarily related to the historic tax credit project which was placed in service in  this project generated the majority of the million in tax credit amortization included in our operating expenses this quarter project delays caused by covid19 have impacted the timing of our other historic tax old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 credit projects that were included in our last quarter estimates please remove any additional tax credit amortization you have in your model other than the actual amount from  we will update you next quarter regarding the timing of the remaining projects as a reminder the tax credit amortization is recognized through expenses in the quarter that corresponds with the placed in service date while the tax benefit is spread over the full year through the tax line with that were happy to answer any questions that you may have and we do have the full team here including jim sandgren and scott evernham question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys hey hows everyone doing james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp were doing fine hope youre doing well too r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co we are we are thank you very much for asking appreciate you taking the questions first ones that i wanted to ask were just on credit so first maybe just sort of a second on the basis point reserve to loan ratio and basically what that means in a cecl world maybe just kind of a refresher there just in terms of adequacy and then you noted that you guys had updated your stress scenario and still remain well capitalized even at the low point just curious how the existing reserve compares to what you guys might consider sort of stress losses in that scenario you used brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah sure scott ill start off and daryl can chime in so just as a reminder so we started the reserve at million at yearend were now sitting at million and the ph million of marked still remains outstanding on those loans as far as the stress test is concerned so we ran the most recent portfolio through our stress test models and come out with cumulative net chargeoffs that are roughly in line with great recession totals in that to range so that would be the right comparable to our basis points indiscernible old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then i had another question on the ppp loans maybe just to i guess a little bit of almost tutorial on how you plan to account for them in addition to what you put in the guidance slide so first of all those everything that you guys have approved that actually gets funded right based on what you guys have in the outlook and then the origination fees those it looks like well all flow through the margin as well so i guess we could see it kind of be ppp be dilutive to the margin here in the immediate term but presuming they are forgiven as planned then you would sort of accelerate so youd get a bumpup in the margin as they pay off is that the right way to think about it brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp exactly right exactly right scott thats how were seeing it r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thank you guys very much james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks scott operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everyone just want to go back to scotts question on the ppp loans i think a lot of the programs are much shorter than i think the two years that you laid out on the slide for modeling purposes i mean we bump up the loan growth in the second quarter by the amount of billion my sense is most of that will come kind of unwind over the next six months is that a reasonable base case with brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc how youre doing it and how youre structuring it brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 thats our expectation too chris but initially you have to set these things up to amortize the life of the loans so if theyre all forgiven within  then youd see a bump there but if it does if theyre not forgiven until  it would be dilutive to the margin in  james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp chris i would just add theres still a lot of details to be determined about how we verify compliance with the forgiveness rules that are that are yet to even be written or published so it could take a couple of quarters for this to kind of all unwind i think were all hopeful it unwinds quickly but the reality is since we dont know rules to play by its going to be difficult to determine exactly how fast these loans are going to get forgiven christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then the expectation is to either fund them with the balance sheet flexibility you have with loanto deposit or through some of the government programs that indiscernible james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah were actively plan to participate with the federal reserves treasury departments program christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay i appreciate that just one more im trying to map slide and the deferrals and the vulnerable industries i think in your prepared remarks you talked about cre being a big piece of the deferrals any color on maybe the restaurant book or some of the other portfolios that might be you might be working with in terms of trying to extend some terms for your stressed clients daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp yeah chris this is daryl certainly within those deferrals theres a fair amount of requests from restaurants and we have been working with those clients i would i dont think that well see them come back again until we get through at least the days and see where we are on the hotels the very little hotel exposure that we have most of those who have been in asking for deferrals as you might imagine and on the cre piece much of that comes from either multifamily that had retail associated with it or the retail has been closed down some just apartments early on were concerned about ability of their tenants to pay rent we looked at a little bit of that and then anything kind of retail strip mall those types of things were also heavy requestors early on in this in the deferral approval process christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and daryl as youre going through this process with your borrower what kind of conversations do you have and in terms of having them put more kind of skin in the game to work with you and to make sure youre not on the hook old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp yeah chris so early on we had some conversations with those clients but mostly just given the uncertainty and the fact that we knew theyre going to have constrains we did a lot of these deferrals just look back on their operating history if they hadnt had problems before look to see what we thought was reasonable and then just moved on as we get to the end of the days on those that we did days we will were going to be asking for updated financial information on sponsors and have to sit down and have in some cases some tough conversations if this hasnt turned around some borrowers we did 180day extensions on because it made sense to do that all of our relationship managers will be out in days talking with those clients beginning to understand how deeply theyve been impacted and start to gather financial information start to have those conversations about additional capital or collateral or how were going to work through this it is so fluid right now christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning maybe could you start just provide some insight into the accounting for the commercial and consumer deferrals to keep accruing but the yield is now lower and if so could you talk about what type of impact that that could have and i would assume its built into your projections and outlook today brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp no change in terry to how we accrue for them obviously theres a cash flow impact on that but relatively minor but well continue to accrue those as we normally would terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then maybe could you expand on the cd pricing over the next i think you just said or months kind of average rates today on the balance sheet what current market rates are brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah so as i said were sitting at three quarters of that book well reprice over the next months and depending on the maturity and the tenor im not giving you a specific number on that but theyll be meaningfully lower than they are today old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then maybe just one last quick one can you just talk about the impact of on fee income in the first quarter from some of the actions you took to help your clients and maybe just some color on ph what happened in march or late in the quarter to help us on a yearoveryear basis kind of model out some of those transactional revenue lines james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp i would say the first quarter impact from some of the fee waivers was de minimis indiscernible on all kind of coming in the middle part of march and so really didnt have a meaningful impact i think as brendon pointed out though i think everybody is seeing the spend slow down right and everybody saw service charges i think across the industry be lower its just hard for us to get a handle on how permanent weve already seen a better pickup in april and so its just really hard for us to have a pickup for a view on how long this lasts and what the exact impact is going to be terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc understood thank you james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks terry operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning i just wanted to follow up on a couple of things can you talk about the magnitude i think brendon you talked about it in your comments and jim you just alluded to just the magnitude of the increase in consumer activity is it meaningful at all or is it just very very early james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp i think its just very very early i will tell you and jon youre in the midwest so you understand i mean i see a lot of people still buying food from restaurants and out and about but clearly card spend is down and thats going to have an impact on i think the entire industry but i think its just too early to understand what the exact impact is i guess what im optimistic is i know our state is having a lot of great conversations about return to work and im very optimistic that by the end of april we will start to start the economy back up here in the midwest and i old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 think hopefully card spend and other things will return back to kind of normal i know its going to take some time to get fully back up to speed but im optimistic that the midwest will start to restart and maybe some of the earliest in the whole country jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a question for you guys as well on the loan demand today you talked about the big pipeline that may not all pull through but what does the loan demand today look like compared to maybe what it was two or three or four weeks ago looks like it was line draws initially but what does it look like today and what are the areas where youre seeing the demand james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah jon this is jim sandgren id say the pipeline is down a little bit the breakdown of that pipeline is still kind of commercial real estate the balance ci i think everyone is kind of taking a step back to see how this is all going to impact their particular industries ph of the pipeline typically when we look at the accepted category its about to likelihood were going to close those deals after reviewing with our commercial segment leaders i think that number drops to closer to still a lot of deals i think to be booked but there are certainly going to be some borrowers that are going to be a little cautious and projects or investments may get delayed a quarter or two so kind of a wait and see james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp jon i might add this is a little bit longer term view but i think manufacturers are looking at their supply chain today and saying how much of this could be done onshore versus offshore and im optimistic that the midwest might see some increased investment over the coming year or two as people think about those critical suppliers in their supply chain and how much of that really should be produced here in the us versus someplace else and so i think the midwest can be a longterm beneficiary of that kind of new view of the supply chain dynamics jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc amen to that i keep going with questions but i have a couple of more followups i guess maybe daryl or scott you talked about the increased cre deferrals and im curious areas where you expect to see deferral increases from here and if you had any shot at what percentage of book do you think that could be deferred i dont view that as a negative i guess im just curious as to how far you think this could go daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp yeah jon this is daryl i think we have most of the deferral requests behind us it has slowed considerably now maybe it pick back up after the ppp but i just dont think that youre going to see significant increases or changes going forward jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 and then one more daryl for you just maybe more of an industry observation im curious the ppp i dont want to say loan quality but any assessment of the business health of the businesses that are in the ppp program and how we should think about that longer term daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp yeah jon thats really interesting so if you think about the program none of the review of what we did on any ppp loans had anything to do with the financial strength of those businesses it was verification now anecdotally as we all work through those it ph goes the gamut right weve got some very strong borrowers who were not concerned about at all that took advantage of this program and then we also have some very small businesses who im sure have very little cash and i know just by talking to some of them that theyre asking when does this money come so it is really all across the board jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc these are things well eventually find out in you think a quarter or two and well know more on that daryl d moore a chief credit executive senior executive vice president old national bancorp yeah the ppp program is a program that is meant to bridge these borrowers through to keep people employed and to the extent that as jim suggested at least in our markets so we can begin to open things up fairly quickly i think will have a really positive impact with respect to being able to get these businesses started up again the longer it goes the more risk we have that these programs wont be as effective as we all hope theyll be jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thanks for taking my question james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks jon operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone thank you for taking my question i appreciate the color you provided with the moodys critical pandemic forecast but curious if you could tell me tell us what the specific economics inputs may have been that you built into your reserving as far as it relates to unemployment in gdp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah so david what we did is we look at every one of the moodys forecast from the 10th the 20th and the 27th we run all of them through our models and sensitize the model so we did consider all of the economic forecasts the one we actually went through and put through as a baseline for a model and then did qualitative adjustments on top list with the one on the 20th and unemployment in there is it goes up to about and then stays elevated at around that level for an extended period of time gdp comes down pretty sharply i think and then starts to rebound in a v shaped manner in  starts growth again in kind of growth at the same pace it was prior those are the two key critical inputs into the model david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you and how frequently have they been providing you with updates brendon falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp so through the quarter end the last one we ran through our model was the one on the 27th but i believe there was another one april that came out but thats not the one that we ran through our model james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp and just as a reminder we only expected to receive one forecast per quarter so interesting timing having multiple forecasts come out throughout the quarter especially this is the first quarter we adopted david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc yeah i would assume that this is obviously new to them but hopefully we can get it to one per quarter at some point here in the future but i appreciate the color thanks guys james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp david i will also add our sense is is weve obviously compared a lot of notes with a lot of different banks and a lot of different banks used a bunch of different forecasts a bunch of different management overlays and so i think youre just going to see as i said in my prepared comments just kind of a wide variance in how we look at this and every day makes a difference of how you view this the future economics around the pandemic and so we thought we put in place a very supportable forecast that made sense for us at the time but every day you have better optics and were going to continue to wait and see and adjust as necessary david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you jim old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2020 james c ryan iii a chairman and chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks david operator and there are no further questions at this time are there any closing remarks
