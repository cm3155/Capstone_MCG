loan growth on a full quarter historical combined basis excluding both ppp loans and purchase accounting adjustments  represents our seventh consecutive quarter of organic loan growth with total loans

higher than the combined  pipeline turning briefly to pricing new money yields on ci were but are now well above portfolio yields new cre productive yields were significantly higher quarteroverquarter at with tied to shortterm rates the heavy floating rate production mix is welcomed as we enter this rising rate cycle slide shows details of our  commercial production by product and market the billion production was well balanced across all products and major markets we are particularly pleased with the results from our chicago market from day one our chicago team understood the strategic logic of the merger and has remained focused and engaged taking care of both new and existing clients moving to slide deposits were stable quarteroverquarter on a historical combined basis although we did see some mix shift as an increase in consumer accounts were offset by seasonal declines in commercial and public total cost of deposits in the quarter was unchanged at basis points while other borrowing costs were down basis points quarteroverquarter next on slide you will see details of our net interest income and margin net interest income of million was consistent with expectations and supported by strong loan growth net interest margin increased basis points from prior quarter to margin excluding accretion and ppp income increased basis points to note this increase was largely due to the higher asset yield from fmbs legacy loan book with the impact of the march rate hike still to come slide provides additional details on our asset liability position and indiscernible the large cash position high percentage of floatingrate loans and industryleading deposit data should lead to ph an at or above peer average nii benefit from future rate hikes slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income which was million for the quarter again this was largely in line with expectations mortgage production on a full quarter combined basis was on plan at million however normalizing gainonsale margins and a higher percentage of portfolio production did impact revenues this quarter pipeline was strong at million at the end of the quarter but we expect the portfolio a higher percentage of mortgage production in the near term which will help offset transactional book runoff also we did see a million increase in the value of our msr that is not reflected in mortgage revenue as we account for our msr on a lower cost per market basis rather than fair value old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 next slide shows a trend in adjusted noninterest expenses adjusting for merger charges and tax credit amortization noninterest expense was million and our adjusted efficiency ratio was we are now running slightly ahead of our planned cost synergies and expect a majority of states to be realized in the back half of the year merger charges are also tracking in line with our diligent estimates with approximately million remaining slide provides further details on our path to achieving the cost savings of million we previously announced with our july systems conversion on track we expect to realize of the cost synergies on an annualized basis by the fourth quarter and remainder in early slide shows our credit trends for both historical old national and first midwest credit conditions continue to be benign and our commercial and consumer portfolios continue to perform exceptionally well we ended the quarter with betterthanpeer results in all key credit metrics net chargeoffs were a modest basis points with the majority related to purchased credit deteriorated loans that had an allowance ph to establish an acquisition on slide you will see the details of our first quarter allowance which stands at million up from million at the end of  million of pcdrelated allowance was established as part of the acquisition and million of day allowance was established for nonpcd loans through provision expense higher reserves related economic forecast and portfolio assumption changes were offset by lower qualitative factors and net chargeoffs in the quarter while our outlook on credit remains optimistic were maintaining elevated levels of qualitative reserves given the geopolitical unrest and potential economic hard landing following this rate tightening cycle in addition to the million in total reserves we also carry million in acquired loans a million of which is related to our fmb merger slide provides details on our capital position at quarterend as expected regulatory capital ratios declined due to mergerrelated items asset growth and share repurchase activities goodwill came in slightly higher than we anticipated driven by larger unrealized losses on fmbs availableforsale investment portfolio that we initially modeled the higher purchase accounting discount will flow through earnings and allow us to build back capital quickly overall our capital position remains strong with a cet1 ratio of as i wrap up my comments here is some key takeaways we are very pleased with our first quarter performance indiscernible in the integration activities remained on track we had a strong commercial loan growth quarter credit remains benign and we are tracking ahead of our planned cost synergies slide includes thoughts on our outlook for we ended the quarter with a record commercial pipeline which supports our favorable outlook on loan growth nii and margin will benefit from continued loan growth and fed rate increases consistent with the asset sensitivity we outlined earlier we expect our key businesses to continue to perform well despite headwinds we expect solid organic growth in our wealth business but aum will be under pressure from market fluctuations in both equities and fixed income mortgages following industry patterns with fee revenue under pressure from normalizing gainonsale margins as well as a higher percentage of portfolio production strong commercial activity should support higher capital markets revenues and lastly we expect pressure on deposit service charges consistent with industry trends a brief update on taxes our income tax benefit was million in the first quarter resulting in a fte tax rate the first quarter included million in benefits related to the vesting of sharebased payments and post merger remeasurement of deferred tax assets were expecting approximately million in tax credit amortization old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 for the remainder of the year with a corresponding fullyear effective tax rate of approximately to on an fte basis and to on a gaap basis for some final comments i will turn the call back over to jim ryan james c ryan chief executive officer director old national bancorp thank you brendon as we wrap up on slide i would like to share a few closing thoughts as we look forward brendon shared our outlook but i would also like to highlight a few key differentiators and a deep discount relative to peers and more broadly the krx as indicated throughout our call this morning the combination of old national and first midwest is going very well and is progressing according to our plan we ended the quarter with strong commercial production momentum as illustrated by a record commercial pipeline reflecting strong client retention and growth of new client relationships we have a tremendous recruiting story for top revenueproducing talent as evidenced by our new hires and we will continue to hire more with our industryleading historical betas and our wellpositioned balance sheet our ability to benefit from rising rates is better than most weve a strong track record of meeting or exceeding our model merger synergies and expect timely brand and systems conversions like in previous mergers we will be disciplined in our underwriting and maintain adequate loan loss reserves and capital when you combine the allowance for loan losses and the credit marks we have a basis points of coverage with historically lower level of net chargeoffs we know transformational mergers take time to recover the discounting inherent in the uncertainty of any combination still we have more tailwind than most and a strong track record of successful executions im very excited and optimistic about our future and my money is on us lastly despite potential distractions from our transformational merger we remain highly focused on serving our clients and communities i think our results for the quarter illustrates the success of those efforts im also grateful for the hundreds of our team members engaged in the systems and branding conversion along with those that are laser focused on serving our clients and communities each day with that said brendon mark sander jim sandgren john moran and i are all here to answer any good questions old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the qa session operator instructions our first question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler scott your line is now open james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp congratulations way to return back to your glory position r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thank you im tired of being embarrassed by my slow trigger point here so i appreciate the acknowledgement i got in the queue james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp we appreciate the effort r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah thank you i appreciate you guys taking the question i wanted to ask brendon maybe first for you if we pull out that ppp and aaas so the underlying margins running around or so would you say thats an appropriate launching point for the combined company in other words does it accurately reflect the combined balance sheet or is there just a bit more upside simply based on well have a full quarter of fmbi in there brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah i think if you actually if you pull out accretion ppp and add back ph days fmb i think your launch rate is a little higher than that closer to i think thats the right way to think about the asset sensitivity we talked about so annualized based on the forward curve thats the right place to grow that from r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 okay good thank you and then along those lines so with asset sensitivity maybe a thought on sort of how the margin projects at the beginning of the cycle versus later on in other words how do your assumptions change first basis points or so fed fund rate hikes versus a little later in the cycle james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah good question it should grow a little faster early and slow down consistent with the path of the rate hikes expected yet if we get a 50basispoint rate hike here in may it may slow down over the rest of the next months its a little early r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect got it all right perfect thank you guys very much james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks scott operator thank you scott our next question comes from ben gerlinger with hovde group ben your line is now open james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp hi good morning ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc good morning everyone i was curious if we could kind of talk about the hiring front to some degree i know jim you laid out a few numbers there and chicago was positive which i think is beneficial to the entire story and definitely shows the continuation with no real hiccups here from the combined entity but when you think about hires going forward across the footprint is there any areas youre looking to grow more than the others and then kind of juxtaposed against that with raising inflation expectations for wages kind of how do you balance the two james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good question ben id like to think about this where theres always room for top revenuegenerating talent right we have an unending appetite for that type of talent and at that market rates whenever market rates are at those times so even if what were paying is on the higher end because we are literally hiring the best in the market and that comes at a cost we will continue to make those investments i believe its a great opportunity right now we have a great story to tell theres plenty of unhappy people out there and so we need to take advantage of that and continue to hire and it will be primarily in the commercial and wealth management spaces those where our conversations continue and again it doesnt mean that we are looking for top talent in the it space and some other key support areas but we will continue to be really focused in on particularly in our major metropolitan markets where i think they have the biggest opportunity and probably the most talent to go after old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp well so ben its mark i just would add its not like we have gaps to fill were just opportunistic and frankly strategically opportunistic meaning again as jim said good revenue producers pay for themselves quickly so we want our folks in the market talking to top talent all the time benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you okay and then kind of bigger picture here when you think about shareholder value through tangible book historically old national has kind of done a deal a year roughly prepandemic i mean this one is obviously much larger and im sure itll take a little bit more time to adjust so when you think about tangible book value longerterm should we think about a deal a year obviously with a bigger balance sheet it takes a little bit more to move the needle or is it the plan to grow earnings tangible opportunistically share repurchases its kind of how your sense of how youre managing that capital and tangible going forward james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah great question strategically i believe were going to do fewer deals probably more meaningful deals mostly because we have to do a more meaningful deal than weve done historically just in order to have the impact to accretion but i would suggest that to be fewer and it wont be because we have lack of opportunities i think there are going to be plenty of opportunities for us well continue to be disciplined in how we approach that particularly as it relates to any kind of tangible book value dilution but fewer deals going forward but maybe more meaningful ones benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc okay thats great a great start to the year congrats james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks ben appreciate your support operator thank you ben our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens terry your line is now open james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning everyone james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi jim maybe a question for you i just want to understand i understand the message on the bottom of page correctly where it says merger benefits are ahead of plan is that connected to the expenses and achieving by the fourth quarter or is that along the lines of recruiting and some of the revenue growth initiatives that youve talked about james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yes and yes and yes yes i think the message to take away today is everything is going according to plan we feel really good about our combination you know that we had a rally for our commercial rms recently and that the energy in the room was just palpable and i think you can see from the results we saw excellent results across every single ph line of our markets against all of the commercial portfolios and so i would say its going according to plan were starting to realize the synergies like we expected our systems and branding conversion are going well client retention has been strong team member retention has been strong so to sum it up i think we couldnt be more happy with where we stand today with the current set of results terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then a question on just the rate sensitivity that is a static kind of balance sheet how should we think about loan growth deposit growth from here and is there any plans for portfolio runoff like we had in the first quarter brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yes so thats transactional book ill answer the last part first transactional loan book we will likely have that around with us for a while opportunities to do anything or dispose of that given the rate environment will be difficult so that million runoff likely to continue that said were going to continue the portfolio to get the amount of mortgages to help offset some of that headwind but were still very optimistic about loan growth loan growth will help us expand nii going forward and when it comes to deposits i think its anybodys best guess i can tell you that we have a pretty rateinsensitive deposit franchise and i bet on us that ours will stick around longer than most others terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and maybe just one last one for mark and feel free to push back on the question hows your team in chicago handling a more conservative underwriting philosophy mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp well i think its i think the underlying philosophies are more sore than you than you think terry i dont think there really is a pushback there i think we kind of speak each others language a little bit frankly again it speaks to the cultural fit we thought about from this all along and i think the credit cultures are actually quite similar so old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 theres a couple of portfolios where perhaps we could do more risk and some of the consumer stuff we did but by and large the credit cultures are very similar james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah terry i would just second that there are a few areas as we went through the policies that quite frankly we were a little bit more had more risk in and there were some areas they had a little more risk in and so were just taking the best of both those policies and its really worked out really nicely as the credit teams come together i think more importantly the teams are energized our lending teams are out there energized and growing relationships and they see a pathway forward to do that regardless of the underwriting standards that are in front of them so i think theres genuine excitement about our ability to do that and i think the results in the pipeline kind of speak to that pretty well and you look at what we did in  the loan growth was a lot of it came out of that chicago team with absolute combined credit culture terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc i appreciate it thanks everyone james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks terry operator thank you terry our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw chris your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great good morning james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning historically old nationals gotten a lot of their rate sensitivity from the deposit base and then fmbi as well too can you just remind us what the mix of retail and commercial deposits are ph for both john v moran a chief strategy officer old national bancorp its about chris its john moran retail about for the balance of public funds christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 okay retail okay thanks john and in terms of the operating leverage you talked about the efficiency ratio in the quarter and we can plug in the math for the savings but kind of at a high level thoughts on kind of where you think the efficiency ratio can go given inflationary pressures but also ph cost is brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp i think we have room to definitely bring that down lower as you said you can do the math but were definitely on a really good glide path and theres still opportunities in the back as we get into continue to make our back office more efficient and theres plenty of opportunities to drive revenue ph then to help that numerator ph as well or denominator christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then maybe brendon by having the the comment on the msr can you just repeat the comment on the writeup in the quarter brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah the msr value actually increased million but we did not that did not flow through revenue chris we indiscernible market so i know some others account for that in fair value and that was helpful to the mortgage revenue and thats why that didnt show up in our revenue line christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you very much james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks chris operator thank you chris operator instructions our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets jon your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2022 hey good morning thank you can you talk a little bit more about the pipeline i think in the prepared comments you guys talked about being up on a combined basis and curious what youd attribute that to and do you feel like loan growth is accelerating at this point above the kind of the pace you saw this past quarter mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah hey jon its mark i think ill take a stab at then maybe jim can add a little bit to it id attribute it to that teams done business as usual and externally focused as simple as that sounds i mean i think that that is it really have not missed a beat so the pipeline is up across all categories across all the teams from about at the end of the year to so jim anything you would add james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah and just clients are doing really well right now in spite of labor challenges supply chain i think theyd be doing even better if they could find labor but theres still a lot of demand theyre still willing to invest and were really optimistic about and the second half of the year at this point so until things changes our team is laser focused on taking care of clients and theyve done a great job jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then brendon maybe for you you guys highlighted your cash balances that you have on the balance sheet and talk a little bit about your plan for putting that to work and then give us an idea of what you guys transferred to heldtomaturity kind of the profile of that brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah again we transferred really longerdated munis to htm so billion of that in terms of putting new money to work we have about billion of cash were going to continue to put that to work over time so i would expect that cash balance to continue to slowly come down over the next to next quarter or two jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then it seems like the revenue environment i mean weve talked about that quite a bit that seems pretty positive and i guess maybe a simple question but your guidance on expenses are you just telling us its as simple as saying million is what you expect for fourth quarter expenses or there is there any other puts and takes you want us to be aware of james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks jon yeah thats what were trying to get you there jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay
