expect we will not comment today and i will refer you to the 8k that we filed on april we will provide any updates in the future when appropriate that said we are focused on running our business as usual as i said earlier in this call we had a great first quarter and look forward to another strong year we already have an exceptionally talented finance accounting and treasury team in place for example ph mike lloyd our treasurer angela putnam our chief accounting officer who are both on the call with us today are very seasoned and each has years plus experience with us john moran we already know from his tenure with us and as a wall street analyst covering banks like old national has seamlessly taken on the interim chief financial officer role in addition john has been a cfo at a publicly traded bank holding company he also was identified as a primary successor during our succession planning process i have complete confidence in john and the entire team im also pleased to introduce carrie goldfeder our new chief credit officer who will join us on our quarterly calls from now on carrie who came to us from capital one and previously worked at ge capital brings our leadership team a wealth of experience and expertise despite her relatively short tenure with us she is already old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 making a significant impact her addition to our leadership team further strengthens our commitment to excellence in all aspects of our operations with that i will now turn the call over to john john v moran iv executive vice president interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp thanks jim turning to slide you can see our first quarter balance sheet which highlights stability in our liquidity and capital positions our first quarter deposit growth has again allowed us to organically fund loan growth while holding our borrowings and brokered deposits consistent over the last year we have grown deposits basis points faster than our yearoveryear loan growth while increasing tangible book value by we ended the quarter with a strong cet1 ratio of and we continue to expect that we will accrete capital at a faster pace than most through the combination of a betterthanpeer return profile and a targeted dividend payout ratio our liquidity and capital levels continue to provide a strong foundation which positions us well into on slide we show the trend in total loan growth and portfolio yields total loans grew annualized from last quarter slightly above our expectations we remain focused on full relationships and structure at prices that meet our risk adjusted return requirements new loan production rates in the high range and marginal funding costs in the low range support our expectation that net interest income has bottomed out in the first quarter the investment portfolio increased very modestly in the quarter due to reinvestment of cash flows partly offset by changes in fair values and the duration was effectively unchanged as we have mentioned in past calls new money yields are running basis points above back book yields and we have approximately billion in cash flows expected over the next months moving to slide we show our trend in total deposits which grew annualized from despite normal seasonal outflows in public funds and business noninterestbearing our broker deposits as a percentage of total deposits is now which remains well below peers ph deposits grew in both retail and commercial and new checking account production remained strong we did experience upward pressure on deposit rates over the course of the quarter as we remained focused on betterthanindustry growth in our deposit base that said we did see a marked deceleration in deposit costs later in the quarter with total deposit costs for the month of march at basis points only basis points higher than our average and a spot rate at march that was down a few basis points from there as a reminder the addition of capstar is expected to increase our total deposit costs by approximately basis points in the second quarter overall we remain very pleased with the execution of our deposit strategy which continues to drive above peer deposit growth at below peer costs slide provides our quarterend income statement we reported gaap net income applicable to common shares of million or per share reported earnings include the following pretax items a million noncash expense associated with the distribution of excess pension assets with the resolution of the legacy first midwest plan an additional million charge related to the fdic special assessment and million in mergerrelated charges excluding these items our adjusted earnings per share was moving on to slide we present details of our net interest income and margin as expected deposit repricing led to modest declines in both net interest income and margin that were in line with our guidance our low total deposit cost of basis points remains a key competitive advantage again we have put up better deposit growth at a lower cost than most banks old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income which was million for the quarter our primary fee businesses performed generally in line with expectations with seasonally lower bank fees continuing to slide we show the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses which were favorable to our guidance due to better occupancy costs a result of a mild winter for the upper midwest lower tax credit amortization and lower professional fees along with lower various sundry other expenses on slide we present our credit trends which remain stable reflecting the quality of both our commercial and consumer portfolios the delinquency ratio declined slightly and the rise in nonperforming loans stems from the migration of three credits migration into adverse categories has slowed from prior quarters and as is historically been the case we maintain a proactive approach to grading and resolution total net chargeoffs were a low basis points and were split evenly between pcd and nonpcd loans our first quarter allowance including reserve for unfunded commitments was unchanged at basis points there were no material changes to our model assumptions and the weighting on the moodys s3 scenario remains on slide we review our capital position at the end of the quarter improvements were seen in all regulatory capital ratios with the move in rates muting the impact of strong retained earnings on our tce built slide includes updated details on our rate risk position and net interest income guidance nii is expected to increase in the second quarter with the inclusion of capstar and then continue to modestly increase in the back half of the year our assumptions are listed on the slide but i would highlight a few of the primary drivers first we assumed three rate cuts of basis points each consistent with the indiscernible second we are anticipating additional late cycle deposit repricing that will result in a terminal beta of by midyear and a noninterestbearing deposit mix that falls to by yearend lastly we assume the final capstar acquisition accounting marks are consistent with those used at deal announcement we believe we have positioned the balance sheet well as we approach the end of this rate cycle with the work to achieve a neutral rate risk position behind us also closing capstar a quarter early modestly helped our neutrality in addition to the three rate cut scenario we did run a forward curve including oneandahalf rate cuts and a static curve through our models the results of each were not materially different from our three rate cut scenario again suggesting that we have effectively managed the balance sheet to neutral slide includes thoughts on our outlook for the remaining items for the second quarter and full year all guidance has been updated to include the capstar close on april purchase accounting assumptions in line with our transaction modeling which is subject to change as we finalize these initial adjustments in the second quarter as you can see our guidance is unchanged in summary we had a strong start to with the first quarter results better than our expectations and strong performance metrics more importantly we continue to demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategic priorities first we are organically funding our loan growth with deposits up yearoveryear basis points better than our loan growth second our adjusted return profile remains top quartile against peers at nearly on tangible common equity third we remain disciplined on operating expenses with an adjusted efficiency ratio of fourth we have a clean credit book with nonpcd net chargeoffs of just basis points and finally we are continuing to rapidly compound tangible book value per share which was up yearoveryear with those comments id like to open the call for your questions and we do have the full team available including mark sander and jim sandgren old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 question and answer section operator we are now opening the floor for questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from scott siefers from piper sandler your line is now open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question indiscernible r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey i was hoping first maybe we could discuss some of those deposit pricing metrics john that you mentioned sort of the late first quarter and then the spot rates as well just maybe overall competitive dynamics whats kind of giving you comfort that it sounds like in places you are able to lower rates exactly just maybe overall competitive and and thoughts on your own positioning as well john v moran iv a executive vice president interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah thanks scott look id say its still a competitive deposit environment out there we are on offense and we are unapologetic about that i mean as long as we can continue to put on good business at incremental margins that makes sense we will continue to be focused on growing our deposits we did see costs start to abate late in the quarter right and thats what i was trying to getting at with the basis points in march which was only basis points higher than average and our spot rate at march was actually a couple of basis points below that so knock on wood hopefully a little bit less competitive but we are still on offense r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thanks john and then i was hoping you could also touch on loan growth a little you know id say your growth seems to be holding in better than what we are seeing for most peers this quarter so just maybe some thoughts on demand overall customer behavior if you sort of seeing demand accelerate decelerate stay the same just maybe overall dynamics please mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah hey scott its mark yeah loan growth came in a little bit above what we expected in  but just a little bit above and i would say ci clients are still in a solid position and youre seeing decent demand out there so were not looking for anything robust but i think we can slightly outgrow the industry which is what weve put out there we also had the benefit of some tailwinds from our construction book that funded this quarter and will for the next couple of quarters so that probably was about half of our ph loans r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 okay perfect all right thanks guys very much appreciate it james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp operator our next question comes from ben gerlinger from citi your line is now open benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hi good morning james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc i just want to touch base on the growth engine i get that you guys dont move your credit box you have the market kind of comes in kind of where your time to shine is is there anything that can be done to potentially exceed the growth guidance you had i mean from here i completely understand you are not changing credit but like if the market offers because competitors are in the market as much are you seeing risk adjusted yields would you be able to grow loans faster than deposits or have the appetite to do so john v moran iv a executive vice president interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp you know we will continue to have the appetite to grow good profitable longterm relationships and we are very much open for business and so id say to answer your question is more dependent to some degree on what how other competitors if they have that same kind of view you know some people are a little more closed i would suggest than we are so i think its possible but were our to organic growth is a little bit above what we think the industry average will be james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp ben i would just add we are going to continue to take advantage of the new talent we have acquired you know some of them are new markets and some of them are existing markets but each one of them are varying degrees of being onboarded and running through any obligations they have so i think there is great opportunity for us to get traction there and then add on the closing of our partnership in tennessee we think that just offers great opportunities to accelerate their growth our growth in that marketplace obviously we have got through some systems conversions and things to get through but the back half of the year really should be getting after it and were looking to have great growth coming out of tennessee and asheville benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you and the other question i had would be more on this high level on credit you guys have always done a great job thats where you hang your hat to be honest but thinking about just credit across your footprint are old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 there any geographies which are experiencing for lack of a better word frothy pricing in maybe commercial real estate or just are you in pencils down mode as any cretype lending products john v moran iv a executive vice president interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp no we are not pencil down ben in any products obviously with the rate environment right now the numbers just dont work for the same level of at the same level that they used to so cre volume across our footprint is down just by market dynamics not because we have changed our underwriting we are still selectively adding new clients in cre as well but certainly more of the growth is going to come in ci where we think we are really well positioned james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp you know i would just add ben to that that comes with full pricing full relationships as usual obviously that discipline has been an important part of how weve been successful but its ever so more present today that we need to ensure that we get our terms and in our terms well continue to to take advantage of every opportunity that comes our way john v moran iv a executive vice president interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp and with that same underwriting our terms requires more equity james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp right benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you all right well i appreciate it thanks for the time guys james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks ben operator our next question comes from terry mcevoy from stephens your line is now open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning thanks for taking my questions james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning terry old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc i maybe start with slide could you just expand on the comments manageable volume of loans subject to refinance risk im guessing a part of it is multifamily and it maybe while youre at it if you could comment on multifamily trends that youre seeing in your markets mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp so ill start terry its mark as we say most manageable level thats based on the data that we provided there we have billion coming due in the next months when we underwrite we stress everything at a basis point cushion so thats why we show above and less than so we have million of loans maturing in the next months that would bump up against our underwriting parameters i would say of that million less than half of it is what we really have a keen eye on that that might have some stress so thats why million you know less than million on our portfolio we think is very manageable i guess is the comment there to your question on multifamily and multifamily in our markets is holding up really well you know i dont know how to describe it better than that we didnt have the highs that some of the coasts perhaps had and so youre still seeing rent growth its modest rent growth but its after many years of really strong rent growth that has more than accounted for the increase in expenses thats happened over those years so we feel really good about our multifamily portfolio terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then as a followup question on security yields they were up a basis point quarteroverquarter the portfolio was up and new money yields were so i guess what was whats behind just the slight increase in security yields mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah the more modest increase was really a chunk of very shortterm us treasuries that matured in the quarter terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and just last quick one the nii bottoming out in the first quarter john is that with and without capstar i just want to make sure i understand that statement john v moran iv a executive vice president interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yes terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc perfect thanks for taking my questions old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning where are you guys finding opportunities to grow deposit balances and relationships can you touch on that john v moran iv a executive vice president interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp you know in our in every one of our lines of business so in our consumer business their primary objectives and goals is active checking accounts and so it is literally gaining market share one by one on a daily basis and seeing that new accounts opened exceeding what runs out the door in commercial as we said earlier just we are still very much open for business so thats when your whole focus is on longterm relationships that require the deposit balances to come with it it partially selffunds itself and then our private banking team and wealth has done a really nice job with our money market promotions getting out there getting after it i guess nothing more than good old fashioned blocking and tackling with a really good team james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp jon i would just add starting in the fall of i personally was around the entire company pounding on the table saying were all deposit gatherers and i dont care whether youre faced off with clients or youre in treasury or youre in marketing we are all deposit gatherers and thats been the mantra which is i think helped drive our success jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good fair enough and then on noninterestbearing i know theres some seasonal factors in there but does it feel like that has bottomed or is close to a bottom that billion and change james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah jon i feel like we are getting close its probably a little early to call the bottom but what we saw this quarter was january was saw outflows some of that is seasonal february we saw stability and we actually started to grow in march so we feel good about the guidance that we have got out there we do think itll continue to kind of come down a little bit but not much from here old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then just one more on credit thank you for the provision guide i think that helps but how do you guys expect the npl balances to progress throughout the year is it safe to assume they are going to continue to go up or is that the wrong read on that james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp i wouldnt assume that jon you know as things as we work things through the pipe we are certainly looking to move things out of npas as well and will i think so its hard to always to predict when someone isnt going to pay you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc right james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp but i think we are well ahead of that view if you can as much as you can with our quarterly problem asset reviews so yeah i wouldnt necessarily assume its going to go up from here but certainly some of the criticized and classifieds will work their way through the pipe over these next months to months jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thank you everyone appreciate it james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks thanks jon operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty from kbw your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right good morning james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc jim or john maybe a question just on slide the outlook if you kind of zoom out and look at the different line item guide where do you think that you have the biggest opportunity or risk is relative to what youve laid out for us old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 john v moran iv a executive vice president interim chief financial officer chief strategy officer old national bancorp yeah you know chris id say the biggest risk is probably just what happens in terms of noninterestbearing and again we feel pretty good that were bottoming out there based on the trends that we saw in the quarter but that would be the biggest downside risk i think biggest upside risk might be for us on the fee line you know i think capital markets was a touch soft this quarter a few swaps one way or another can make a difference there and its hard to kind of get really too excited about mortgage but pipelines theyre up pretty pretty solidly so maybe well have a nice spring selling season here christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then maybe jim on thoughts on just capital return once you get through the integration any thoughts james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah i think christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc on buyback later in the year james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah great great question and certainly a topic of conversation around here i think you are right i think we are focused on getting through the integration of capstar kind of getting a better read on what we think the balance of the year looks like and then as we get in to the back half of the year i think that could be something thats a serious part of our conversation you know unchecked capital grows pretty quickly and so i think there will be opportunities to think about capital a little differently than we have in the last couple of years christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then maybe final one on a lot of discussion from your peers about derisking you guys dont have the concentrations is there anything in the portfolio that might be being considered to accelerate just move on and kind of derisk while you could james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp from a high level from my perspective theres nothing that we need to do different in our portfolio management obviously its a constant source of conversation around optimization but usually it means slowing things down turning things up than it is about moving assets off the balance sheet so while theres always always ongoing portfolio management discipline around that on the margin well continue to have conversations around asset classes we think we can get the best return for our capital allocation and we will make those decisions but they will have a de minimis effect quarter in quarter out old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks jim james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks operator our next question comes from david long from raymond james your line is now open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc the wanted to talk about the nonperformer nonperforming loan line you were up about in the quarter i think someone mentioned that maybe there is a few credits involved there but specifically whats what happened there in the nonperforming loan line and to drive it up in the quarter mark g sander q president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah david its mark i think its just the ebb and flow the natural ebb and flow of credit you know it was three credits that drove it the largest was a multifamily property that im not worried about candidly at all i dont think theres a risk of loss there and then we had two ci credits that were not related not symptomatic of any broader broader concern so just episodic three credits david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you mark and then operating expenses seemed very well managed in the quarter i know you have capstar coming on here but excapstar whats going on just with the core operating expenses it seemed better than expected were there any you highlighted a few items that we took out anything else in the quarter that was maybe nonrecurring or expenses that maybe you missed out on this quarter mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp no i wouldnt characterize anything as nonrecurring in there other than what we had called out separately it was as you know sitting in chicago a milder winter we moved less snow around this winter that helped i mean theres sort of six or seven good guys in there that i would just kind of caution dont take and run rate it and add capstar on to it i think we have a little bit of lift here in the second quarter and thats reflected in the guidance old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 david j long q analyst raymond james
