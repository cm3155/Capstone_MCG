challenges that lie ahead old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 thank you i will now turn the call over to brendon brendon b falconer chief financial officer old national bancorp thanks jim turning to the quarters results on slide we reported gaap net income applicable to common shares of million or per share reported earnings were impacted by million in mergerrelated charges excluding these charges as well as debt securities losses our adjusted earnings per share was up yearoveryear slide shows the trend in total loan growth on a historical combined basis excluding ppp loans  represents our ninth consecutive quarter of organic loan growth with total loans increasing on an annualized basis commercial loans grew an annualized while consumer loans grew an annualized driven by residential mortgage the investment portfolio decreased ph quarteroverquarter due to raterelated fair value adjustments and reinvestment of portfolio cash flows in support of loan growth we expect investment cash flows of million over the next months slide provides further details of our commercial loans and pipeline the strong second quarter growth was well distributed with annualized growth in ci and in cre  production put some pressure on the pipeline but loan demand remained strong and we did see a marked increase in the ph excessive category which was up million over prior quarter turning briefly to pricing new money yields on ci increased basis points from  to with new cre production yields up basis points to slide shows details of our  commercial production the billion of production was wellbalanced across all product lines and major markets and as always was consistent with our disciplined approach to credit in addition all of our product segments posted quarteroverquarter balance sheet growth which demonstrates the success weve had in retaining lenders and clients in chicago our successful entrances into new expansion markets and the quality of our commercial teams throughout our footprint moving to slide end of period deposits were up quarteroverquarter driven by increases in municipal deposits we are pleased with the stability of our commercial and retail deposit balances particularly our non interestbearing accounts our low loantodeposit ratio coupled with asset liquidity in the form of our investment and indirect book provides flexibility heading into this competitive deposit market that said we are actively defending deposit balances through competitive rack rates and pricing exceptions we are also playing offense to various deposit specials and select geographies where we have limited market share these actions put upward pressure on rates in  with average total deposit costs up basis points quarteroverquarter to a still very low basis points interestbearing deposit costs were up basis points to basis points resulting in a cycletodate beta of just our granular lowcost deposit base should continue to give us a beta advantage relative to peers throughout this rate cycle but pricing is expected to increase in  as a reference point we ended the quarter with a spot rate on interestbearing deposits of basis points on september next on slide you will see details of our net interest income and margins both improved more than expected due to federal loan growth higher interest rates and betterthanexpected deposit pricing life net interest margin expanded basis points quarteroverquarter to core margin excluding accretion and ppp income increased basis points to old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 slide provides additional details on our asset liability position and projected margin range core margin is expected to continue to expand meaningfully over the next quarter albeit at a slower pace the assumption in our outlook includes a fed funds target rate of at yearend and a yield on 10year treasuries our outlook assumes deposit betas increasing from today to a cycletodate beta by yearend of this equates to a marginal beta of we believe the current quarter should allow us to expand margin beyond margin expansion is expected to slow but we believe we can manage margin deposit betas at or below our asset betas into also while remained wellpositioned for rising rates we have been proactively hedging the balance sheet over the last several quarters to protect our margin from the possibility of a hard economic landing and quick reversal in fed policy we added million in hedge protection this quarter with an average floor strike of slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income which was million for the quarter this is generally in line with our expectations as market conditions continue to put pressure on mortgage and wealth revenues the linkedquarter decrease was also impacted by million and discrete  items we discussed last quarter next slide shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses adjusting for merger charges and tax credit amortization noninterest expense is million and our adjusted efficiency ratio was historically low at expenses were higher than anticipated due to million in provision for unfunded commitments related to  loan growth a million incentive accrual increase and a million conversionrelated reduction in deferred loan origination costs this total million impact of incentives and deferred costs are not expected to recur despite the moving parts in  we continue to run ahead of our planned cost synergies and are on track for the promised merger synergies in the fourth quarter  expenses are now expected to be million a million improvement from our priorquarter estimate which equates to approximately of cost synergies achieved by yearend slide shows our credit trends credit conditions are stable and our commercial and consumer portfolios continue to perform exceptionally well net chargeoffs were a modest basis points excluding basis points of net chargeoffs and pcd loans that has an allowance established through acquisition accounting our special assets team is continuing to work through our pcd loans and we would expect chargeoffs from this portfolio remain elevated the provision expense impact from this effort is expected to be minimal as we carry million or approximately reserve against this book on slide youll see details of our third quarter allowance which stands at million up from million at the end of  reserve build was driven primarily by strong loan growth with relatively small increases due to portfolio mix and a marginally worse economic forecast the financial health of our clients remained strong and while credit metrics are stable we believe it is prudent to maintain elevated qualitative reserves given the uncertainty in our base case economic outlook in addition to the million in total reserves we also carry million in credit marks slide provides details on our capital position at quarterend our cet1 ratio remains strong at our tce ratio declined basis points quarteroverquarter due to increases in unrealized losses in our investment book total oci is now impacted tce by basis points we continue to monitor our balance sheet for economic stress and feel very comfortable with our capital levels old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 as i wrap on my comments here are some key takeaways we grew adjusted earnings per share of profitability ratios continue to be strong with an adjusted return on tangible common equity of and a return on average assets of we posted another strong quarter of loan growth and better than peer margin expansion aided by an industryleading deposit beta expenses also continue to be well managed with a record low efficiency ratio of with meaningful savings yet to come slide includes thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of we ended the quarter with a strong commercial pipeline which supports our favorable outlook on loan growth albeit at a slower pace in  deposits are expected to be stable excluding the impact of the hsa sale net interest income and margins should benefit from continued loan growth and fed rate increases consistent with the margin guidance we outlined earlier we expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well despite headwinds with wealth management and mortgage following industry patterns commercial activity should support continued strong capital markets revenues albeit at a lower level in  we have also finalized plans to implement changes to our nsf od policies in december that are largely consistent with industry best practice we estimate this impact to be minimal in  and approximately million for the full year of turning to taxes we expect approximately million in tax credit amortization for the remainder of the year with a corresponding full year effective tax rate of approximately on a core fte basis and on a gaap basis lastly our sales of hsa deposit is expected to close in midnovember real estate repositioning as well as other strategic investments are expected to partially offset the gain from that sale with those comments id like to open the call for your questions we do have a full team available including mark sander jim sandgren and john moran old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler scott your line is now open james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking my question hows everybody doing james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp were doing great great to see you take your rightful place back as number one r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co you know i even jot it down ive been in the queue since ive got to get a life at some point here im glad to get in the queue so i appreciate you taking the question maybe brendon first question the most appropriate for you so obviously just a huge ramp up in the margin and nii with great deposit betas just curious given some of the steps youve taken to kind of protect things what do you think is your ability to grow nii and the margin sequentially once the fed stops raising rates and just maybe kind of qualitatively how much of this margin is levitating just on a transitory basis and how much can you kind of harvest and keep for a longer period brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp we had a lot to unpack there and a lot of it will depend on deposit betas and deposit pricing post the fed move that said we have a pretty good view of our margin with a forward curve out to and we feel really confident we continue to expand the margin as the fed continues to move rates post that well continue to have opportunities to reprice our fixed rate book at much higher levels than what its running off at and thatll help offset additional deposit costs i think the big question is how long do the fed stay there will be a big determining factor in how long we can hold on to the margin at the peak james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp id also add scott we continue to have a mix shift right on a loweryielding assets and the higheryielding commercial assets and that will continue to help let the margin grow regardless of what the fed does or doesnt do old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect and then just sort of a cleaner question brendon can you sort of repeat what those offsets were to the anticipated hfa gain in the fourth quarter brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah were evaluating a number of things the biggest ones are thoughts around all of our real estate both branch and nonbranch real estate and were working through that now so that will have an impact and well likely spend some of that gain in the fourth quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect so in other words kind of a onetime gain and that potentially onetime charges offsetting maybe some portion of it james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yes which should also lead to some additional savings in the next year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah perfect all right good thank you guys very much james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks scott operator thank you for your question our next question comes from the line of ben gerlinger with hovde group ben your line is now open benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc good morning everyone james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp hi ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc scotts not lying about the fact he dialed in and beat me by minutes old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp were watching you dialed in first and we saw that benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc i was curious i mean i know that you guys have a pretty large footprint now relative to the past five years so im curious just from a kind of a macro perspective what do you what are the kind of the conversations youre having with clients today some of their concerns and kind of juxtaposed against the lending portfolio does that open up any opportunities for growth or any areas you might want to potentially pivot away from i know you guys dont change your credit standards throughout the cycle but its kind of that macro conversation youre having with clients brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp the macro conversation with clients is we think we have opportunities across our geographies and across our four lines of business and you already saw that this quarter real estate was the largest growth driver this quarter but all three of our other lines in commercial middle market business banking and specialty all grew about million and it was widely dispersed geographically and i think we have the team to compete and win in every market were in ben so we dont favor one versus the other i think theres just a lot of good opportunities to grow jim anything you would add james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp no and were going to continue to look to expand in other markets obviously we talked a little bit about nashville and st louis and kansas city continue to perform well and looking at other potential metro markets that can help support growth benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you thats helpful james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp i think franchise power of the franchise ben i would just add the power of the franchise is getting noticed in some markets that we hadnt been noticed before and i think thats really getting people excited about joining our company and as we talked about we were able to hire clientfacing folks this quarter and we continue to do that there isnt a week goes by that we dont have somebody come through headquarters here looking at an opportunity to join the team and im really excited about that its great to tell our story the story resonates really well with folks and i think its going to allow us to continue to make those strategic investments benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc yeah that actually dovetails nicely to my next question i know you just said the plus and then you highlighted nashville specifically from a lender perspective is there any cities or msas you wanted you could highlight i dont know if i tried to build them correctly or not old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp no i would just say in our existing footprint we continue to have opportunities adjacent to our footprint were having conversations so were not looking at expanding outside the midwest at this point in time we still feel like were very comfortable solid in the midwest we do think theres an opportunity to build on nashville the wealth management presence were in early days there we really just got started with our office the great news is they are making referring lending opportunities to our team and so were servicing those opportunities today but well be looking to add folks in that team selectively where it makes sense so that may be the only place really outside the midwest that i would note but its mostly inside the midwest inside our existing footprint or to maybe some adjacent markets where we have opportunities to continue to grow brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp and most of the hires reflect our footprint ben weve hired over the last two quarters seven reit people in chicago seven reit people in minneapolis a few in indianapolis i mean so weve got a handful in a number of other markets benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you sorry i muted myself appreciate it ill step back in the queue thank you james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp no worries operator thank you for your question our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens terry your line is now open james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning everyone good morning james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good to hear from you terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc same here i guess the first question do you think the potential savings from the real estate positioning can offset the million decline in service charges old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp were early stages of estimating that but i dont think thats far off what were hoping to achieve with that with that repositioning terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then maybe just sticking with expenses the million run rate for expenses and then youve got some remaining cost savings in the early part of next year how should we kind of think about and maybe you could frame kind of your expense expectations for next year or is it still too early given what youre going to do with some of the real estate repositioning brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp no i think million is a good launching point and based to move off of into and you layer in some you know merit increases as we talked about were not going to stop hiring but we also have some cost savings to come but i think million is a good base with merits et you gets in the ballpark of how were thinking about next year terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc perfect and then maybe just a point of clarity the deposit beta was that by the end of the fourth quarter of this year and if so what are your thoughts on call it through the cycle deposit betas as we think about the end of next year brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah that is through the end of the fourth quarter so itll be the cycle that may cycletodate beta who knows where this deposit beta ultimately goes weve been pleased that weve been able to underperform outperform our expectations today i can just tell you that last cycle the combined organization of smb and omb had a significant advantage in the deposit betas we expect to continue to keep that advantage in this rate cycles no matter what deposit betas do terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thats great thanks for all the information operator thank you for your question our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw chris your line is now open james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning chris old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning hey brendon brendon maybe i have a question on just the size of the balance sheet you talked in your guide for the  a static balance sheet x the deposit sale in your prepared remarks you talked about around million or million of cash flows on the bond book to come off how should be thinking about just the size of the investment portfolio or maybe another way what are your expectations for deposit growth brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp so i think were going to fight to hold deposits stable i think deposit stable next year is a win i think given what weve seen in the industry and so were going to fight to hold that were going to allow investment cash flows to help provide liquidity we also have an amount of asset liquidity and a few transaction books including the indirect book and we have lots of wholesale funding capacity we just feel like we have a lot of options for liquidity heading into this that we dont have to fight for every deposit but were going to go out there and take care of our clients and we think we have room for and were starting from a low loantodeposit ratio base as well james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp and his comments exclude the hsa sale as you remember that that will come off the top during the quarter christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks for that so the million just to go back to that million bond cash flows the expectation is the bond portfolio would shrink to fund loan growth to some degree brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yes christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yes christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then maybe jim just a higher level question you were talking probably about the efficiency ratio which is a great metric maybe comment about trajectory from here james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 yeah i think if you look at brendons expense guidance and expanded margins i think modest improvements are expected but its not going to be and maybe as quickly as we got to but i think all the trends are heading in the right direction to see that number improve christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and maybe just a quick credit question i think in your prepared remarks you said expect a little bit higher chargeoffs on the pce book maybe any higher level question or comments about what you might be seeing in a legacy fmbi book which i think gets a little bit more attention mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp nothing that is unusual or that we havent seen before chris i guess is what i would say this is mark our commercial clients are still seeing strong demand and profitability and liquidity overall theres a little growing sense of caution out there so nothing different than what were all hearing in terms of economic outlook so i know we feel good about our credit metrics christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks mark james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks chris operator thank you for your question operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets jon your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning everyone james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning jon yeah good to hear from you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc sorry i dialed in at the top of the hour and i know i was going to be last just a quick followup on chris last question you talked a little bit about moderating growth but give us a little bit more in terms of what youre seeing there in terms of moderation and severe is the wrong word but how material is it and then talk about kind of your approach to the marketplace as well if youve been any more cautious james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 yeah i dont really think were being any more cautious i think like everybody else were wondering about what next year brings us but the pipeline was our second highest pipeline at billion brendon told you our accepted category is up meaningfully i mean so we continue to expect the portfolios to grow just the pipelines now that have to be closed billion this quarter but were really not slowing down at all and i think our view is really consistent with what other ceos are thinking about i think everybody is looking forward and cautious about a potential recession but there really have not been much signs of it from our borrowers today particularly in the midwest and mark or jim mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp said in another way but the same thing our nearterm outlook is favorable because the pipelines are still very strong and clients are still doing quite well i mean but again some of the cre markets they are immune to the impact of rising rates but there is plenty of room to run in the form of equity levels and debt service coverage ratios of our clients so look the pipeline is still really strong there still as well james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp you follow us a long time jon annualized growth is a strong number by any measure and so i think were all just cautious that how we continue to grow these kinds of levels over the long term i think the answer is its probably going to get revert back closer to some longterm average mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp and as what we said at the end in the second quarter and were surprised on the upside about this quarter well probably be well still grow in  but at a little lower pace than this quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay yeah its an interesting time no doubt about it brendon slide you talked about average new production yields give us an idea of where things are coming on today on ci and cre in terms of yields brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah theyre marginally up from there so today september yields are up a little bit bps to bps in commercial real estate but not much higher but i expect those continue to go higher given where the fiveyear has moved and certainly what we expect the libor to do over the next year and sofr to do over the next days jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay just two more wealth management youve talked about a little bit like scottsdale and nashville and understand you expect the numbers to be down but can you talk a little bit more about organic growth what youre seeing in terms of progress there i dont know if its new households or how you measure it but take the market impact away what are you seeing old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp all right weve seen organic growth and its all about focusing on what you can control and we know we cant control market values but we can control what we produce and what retention we have and we feel really good about the opportunities not just these teams that we hired thats incremental but each of our existing markets we see organic growth we measure it by net new clients and net assets under management jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc any numbers in terms of net new clients mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp we monitor them we dont disclose them i guess is the best way to say it so it is growing james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp i think internally we are meeting our own expectations around our growth in that business from the organic acquisition of new clients and nashville and our highnet worth teams are off just a really strong start i mean were getting some at bats that weve never had a chance at before given the sophistication level of the new team were bringing on we brought on last year and the new team in nashville i mean theyre bringing in just great new opportunities for us jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay and then just last one smaller item you talked about playing offense in deposit gathering where you have limited market share can you give us some example of that thanks brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah so well go out in an area in michigan maybe pick a grand rapids where we have relatively low market share and well put a pretty heavy writedown and a money market a new money market account at a fairly high rate generally a teaser rate well run some ph price ecd specials in those markets and try to be annoying to some of our bank competitors in that space and thats worked really well for us last rate cycle and its allowing us to grow some deposits in this cycle jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it thank you james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks jon old national bancorp onb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 operator thank you for your question we now have a followup question from chris mcgratty with kbw chris your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great brendon just a clarification on the noninterest income guidance it sounds like the run rate on the service charges will make its way to once the implementations go in and i heard you on the trust what about the other income line its kind of been all over the over the board and just trying to get a sense of if we take all these pieces together whats like a reasonable range for just total fees entering next year brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah i think the other income item is million on the slide i think thats a good base to go from the noise really was in and we had that million of kind of an odd set of factors that hit  but i think the million is a good run rate base christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so that would put kind of the total run rate around million something like that brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp i think thats fair christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you james c ryan iii a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks chris operator thank you for your question there are no further questions at this time id like to turn the call back to jim ryan for closing remarks james c ryan iii chief executive officer director old national bancorp
