item risk factors we face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses the following is a summary of some of the more important factors that could affect our businesses market our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and broader economic conditions our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by declining asset values particularly where we have net long positions receive fees based on the value of assets managed or receive or post collateral our marketmaking activities have been and may in the future be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility our investment banking client intermediation asset management and wealth management businesses have been adversely affected and may in the future be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and ceos due to declines in economic activity and other unfavorable economic geopolitical or market conditions our asset management and wealth management businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the poor investment performance of our investment products or a client preference for products other than those which we offer or for products that generate lower fees inflation has had and could continue to have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition liquidity our liquidity profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit reductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding group inc is a holding company and its liquidity depends on payments and loans from its subsidiaries many of which are subject to legal regulatory and other restrictions on providing funds or assets to group inc credit our businesses profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of or defaults by third parties concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our marketmaking underwriting investing and financing activities derivative transactions and delayed documentation or settlements may expose us to credit risk unexpected risks and potential losses operational a failure in our operational systems or human error malfeasance or other misconduct could impair our liquidity disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and cause losses a failure or disruption in our infrastructure or in the operational systems or infrastructure of third parties could impair our liquidity disrupt our businesses damage our reputation and cause losses a failure to protect our computer systems networks and information and our clients information against cyber attacks and similar threats could impair our ability to conduct our businesses result in the disclosure theft or destruction of confidential information damage our reputation and cause losses we may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies legal and regulatory our businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world a failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses we may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity substantial civil or criminal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause us significant reputational harm which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects in conducting our businesses around the world we are subject to political legal regulatory and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries the application of regulatory strategies and requirements in the us and nonus jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions could create greater risk of loss for group incs security holders the application of group incs proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for group incs security holders table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries our commodities activities particularly our physical commodities activities subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks including environmental reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs competition our results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the composition of our client base the financial services industry is highly competitive the growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new products and technologies including trading and distributed ledger technologies including cryptocurrencies has increased competition our businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees market developments and general business environment our businesses financial condition liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by unforeseen or catastrophic events including pandemics terrorist attacks extreme weather events or other natural disasters climate change could disrupt our businesses and adversely affect client activity levels and the creditworthiness of our clients and counterparties and our efforts to address concerns relating to climate change could result in damage to our reputation our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by russias invasion of ukraine and related sanctions and other developments certain of our businesses our funding instruments and financial products may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of interbank offered rates ibors in particular usd libor certain of our businesses and our funding instruments may be adversely affected by changes in other reference rates currencies indexes baskets or etfs to which products we offer or funding that we raise are linked our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations may be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by escalating tensions between the us and china we face enhanced risks as new business initiatives and acquisitions lead us to engage in new activities operate in new locations transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us to new asset classes and markets we may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits or synergies from acquisitions or other business initiatives in the time frames we expect or at all the following are detailed descriptions of our risk factors summarized above market our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and broader economic conditions many of our businesses by their nature do not produce predictable earnings and all of our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally both directly and through their impact on client activity levels and creditworthiness these conditions can change suddenly and negatively our financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate a favorable business environment is generally characterized by among other factors high global gross domestic product growth regulatory and market conditions that result in transparent liquid and efficient capital markets low inflation business consumer and investor confidence stable geopolitical conditions and strong business earnings unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by low levels of or declines in economic growth business activity or investor business or consumer confidence concerns over a potential recession changes in consumer spending or borrowing patterns pandemics limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital illiquid markets increases in inflation interest rates exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates high levels of inflation or stagflation concerns about sovereign defaults uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy government shutdowns debt ceilings or funding the extent of and uncertainty about potential increases in tax rates and other regulatory changes limitations on international trade and travel laws and regulations that limit trading in or the issuance of securities of issuers outside their domestic markets outbreaks of domestic or international tensions or hostilities terrorism nuclear proliferation cybersecurity threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication energy transmission or transportation networks or other geopolitical instability or uncertainty corporate political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets extreme weather events or other natural disasters or a combination of these or other factors the financial services industry and the securities and other financial markets have been materially and adversely affected in the past by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes by a serious lack of liquidity and by high levels of borrower defaults in addition concerns about actual or potential increases in interest rates inflation and other borrowing costs a resurgence of covid19 cases european sovereign debt risk and its impact on the european banking system and limitations on international trade have at times negatively impacted the levels of client activity table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries general uncertainty about economic political and market activities and the scope timing and impact of regulatory reform as well as weak consumer investor and ceo confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty has in the past negatively impacted client activity which can adversely affect many of our businesses periods of low volatility and periods of high volatility combined with a lack of liquidity have at times had an unfavorable impact on our marketmaking businesses changes or proposed changes to us international trade and investment policies particularly with important trading partners have in recent years negatively impacted financial markets continued or escalating tensions may result in further actions taken by the us or other countries that could disrupt international trade and investment and adversely affect financial markets those actions could include among others the implementation of sanctions tariffs or foreign exchange measures the largescale sale of us treasury securities or other restrictions on crossborder trade investment or transfer of information or technology any such developments could adversely affect our or our clients businesses financial institution returns may be negatively impacted by increased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceived government support of such institutions in the event of future financial crises relative to financial institutions in countries in which governmental support is maintained in addition liquidity in the financial markets has in the past been and could in the future be negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures adjust to evolving regulatory frameworks in january the outstanding debt of the us reached its statutory limit and the us treasury department commenced taking extraordinary measures to prevent the us from defaulting on its obligations if congress does not raise the debt ceiling the us could default on its obligations including treasury securities that play an integral role in financial markets a default by the us could result in unprecedented market volatility and illiquidity heightened operational risks relating to the clearance and settlement of transactions margin and other disputes with clients and counterparties an adverse impact to investors including money market funds that invest in us treasuries downgrades in the us credit rating further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs and a recession in the us or other economies even if the us does not default continued uncertainty relating to the debt ceiling could result in downgrades of the us credit rating which could adversely affect market conditions lead to margin disputes further increases in interest rates and borrowing costs and necessitate significant operational changes among market participants including us a downgrade of the federal governments credit rating could also materially and adversely affect the market for repurchase agreements securities borrowing and lending and other financings typically collateralized by us treasury or agency obligations further the fair value liquidity and credit ratings of securities issued by or other obligations of agencies of the us government or related to the us government or its agencies as well as municipal bonds could be similarly adversely affected our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by declining asset values particularly where we have net long positions receive fees based on the value of assets managed or receive or post collateral many of our businesses have net long positions in debt securities loans derivatives mortgages equities including private equity and real estate and most other asset classes these include positions we take when we act as a principal to facilitate our clients activities including our exchangebased marketmaking activities or commit large amounts of capital to maintain positions in interest rate and credit products as well as through our currencies commodities equities and mortgagerelated activities in addition we invest in similar asset classes substantially all of our investing and marketmaking positions and a portion of our loans are markedtomarket on a daily or other periodic basis and declines in asset values directly and promptly impact our earnings unless we have effectively hedged our exposures to those declines in certain circumstances particularly in the case of credit products including leveraged loans and private equities or other securities that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets it may not be possible or economic to hedge our exposures and to the extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the assets sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate the trading markets for certain assets which may make it difficult to sell hedge or value such assets we may incur losses from time to time as trading markets deteriorate or cease to function including with respect to loan commitments we have made or securities offerings we have underwritten the inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets has in the past negatively affected and may in the future negatively affect our capital liquidity or leverage ratios our funding costs and our ability to deploy capital in our exchangebased marketmaking activities we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market including by purchasing securities in a declining market in markets where asset values are declining and in volatile markets this results in losses and an increased need for liquidity we receive assetbased management fees based on the value of our clients portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and in some cases we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments declines in asset values would ordinarily reduce the value of our clients portfolios or fund assets which in turn would typically reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries we post collateral to support our obligations and receive collateral that supports the obligations of our clients and counterparties when the value of the assets posted as collateral or the credit ratings of the party posting collateral decline the party posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral or if possible reduce its trading position an example of such a situation is a margin call in connection with a brokerage account therefore declines in the value of asset classes used as collateral mean that either the cost of funding positions is increased or the size of positions is decreased if we are the party providing collateral this can increase our costs and reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving collateral this can also reduce our profitability by reducing the level of business done with our clients and counterparties in addition volatile or less liquid markets increase the difficulty of valuing assets which can lead to costly and timeconsuming disputes over asset values and the level of required collateral as well as increased credit risk to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate collateral in cases where we foreclose on collateral sudden declines in the value or liquidity of the collateral have in the past resulted in and may in the future despite credit monitoring overcollateralization the ability to call for additional collateral or the ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation result in significant losses to us especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation in addition we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that the foreclosure was not permitted under the legal documents was conducted in an improper manner including in violation of law or caused a client or counterparty to go out of business our marketmaking activities have been and may in the future be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility certain of our marketmaking activities depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities to our clients and decreases in volatility have reduced and may in the future reduce these opportunities and the level of client activity associated with them and adversely affect the results of these activities increased volatility while it can increase trading volumes and spreads also increases risk as measured by valueatrisk var and may expose us to increased risks in connection with our marketmaking activities or may cause us to reduce our inventory in order to avoid increasing our var limiting the size of our marketmaking positions can adversely affect our profitability in periods when volatility is increasing but asset values are declining significantly it may not be possible to sell assets at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts in those circumstances we have been and may in the future be forced to either take on additional risk or to realize losses in order to decrease our var in addition increases in volatility increase the level of our rwas which increases our capital requirements our investment banking client intermediation asset management and wealth management businesses have been adversely affected and may in the future be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and ceos due to declines in economic activity and other unfavorable economic geopolitical or market conditions our investment banking business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by market conditions poor economic conditions and other uncertain geopolitical conditions may adversely affect and have in the past adversely affected investor and ceo confidence resulting in significant industrywide declines in the size and number of underwritings and of advisory transactions which would likely have an adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins in particular because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues is derived from our participation in large transactions a decline in the number of large transactions has in the past and would in the future adversely affect our investment banking business similarly in recent years crossborder initial public offerings and other securities offerings have accounted for a significant proportion of new issuance activity legislative regulatory or other changes that limit trading in or the issuance of securities outside the issuers domestic markets that result in or could result in the delisting or removal of securities from exchanges or indices have in the past adversely affected and would in the future adversely affect our underwriting and client intermediation businesses furthermore changes or proposed changes to international trade and investment policies of the us and other countries could negatively affect market activity levels and our revenues in certain circumstances market uncertainty or general declines in market or economic activity may adversely affect our client intermediation businesses by decreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing volatility but at other times market uncertainty and even declining economic activity may result in higher trading volumes or higher spreads or both market uncertainty volatility and adverse economic conditions as well as declines in asset values may cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other products or their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues principally in our asset management and wealth management businesses even if clients do not withdraw their funds they may invest them in products that generate less fee income table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries our asset management and wealth management businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the poor investment performance of our investment products or a client preference for products other than those which we offer or for products that generate lower fees poor investment returns in our asset management and wealth management businesses due to either general market conditions or underperformance relative to our competitors or to benchmarks by funds or accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or sell affect our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients this could affect the management and incentive fees that we earn on aus or the commissions and net spreads that we earn for selling other investment products such as structured notes or derivatives to the extent that our clients choose to invest in products that we do not currently offer we will suffer outflows and a loss of management fees further if due to changes in investor sentiment or the relative performance of certain asset classes or otherwise clients continue to invest in products that generate lower fees eg passively managed or fixed income products our average effective management fee would continue to decline and our asset management and wealth management businesses could be adversely affected inflation has had and could continue to have a negative effect on our business results of operations and financial condition inflationary pressures have affected economies financial markets and market participants worldwide inflationary pressures have increased certain of our operating expenses and have adversely affected consumer sentiment and ceo confidence central bank responses to inflationary pressures have also resulted in higher market interest rates which in turn have contributed to lower activity levels across financial markets in particular for debt underwriting transactions and mortgage originations and resulted in lower values for certain financial assets which have adversely affected our equity and debt investments higher interest rates increase our borrowing costs and have required us to increase interest paid on our deposits if inflationary pressures persist our expenses may increase further we may be unable to achieve our efficiency ratio target activity levels for certain of our businesses in particular debt underwriting and mortgages may remain at low levels or decline further our interest expense could increase faster than our interest income reducing our net interest income and net interest margin certain of our investments could continue to incur losses or generally low levels of returns aus could decline reducing management and other fees economies worldwide could experience recessions and we could continue to operate in a generally unfavorable economic and market environment liquidity our liquidity profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets liquidity is essential to our businesses it is of critical importance to us as most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access secured andor unsecured debt markets an inability to raise or retain deposits an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments lack of timely settlement of transactions unusual deposit outflows or other unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral such as in march when corporate clients drew on revolving credit facilities in response to the covid19 pandemic this situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control such as a general market or economic disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us or even by the perception among market participants that we or other market participants are experiencing greater liquidity risk we employ structured products to benefit our clients and hedge our own risks the financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are often complex and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress our investing and financing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets which could restrict liquidity for our positions further our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is not generally a liquid market for such assets as well as in circumstances where other market participants are seeking to sell similar otherwise generally liquid assets at the same time as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis or in response to changes to rules or regulations for example in an investment management firm with large positions with several financial institutions defaulted resulting in rapidly declining prices in the securities underlying those positions in addition clearinghouses exchanges and other financial institutions with which we interact may exercise setoff rights or the right to require additional collateral including in difficult market conditions which could further impair our liquidity numerous regulations have been adopted that impose more stringent liquidity requirements on large financial institutions including us these regulations require us to hold large amounts of highly liquid assets and reduce our flexibility to source and deploy funding in addition our need to manage our operations in light of certain regulatory requirements when applicable thresholds are met has in the past limited and may in the future limit our ability to raise deposits in gsib or other funding which could adversely affect our liquidity or ability to respond efficiently to liquidity stress table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries our businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit widening credit spreads as well as significant declines in the availability of credit have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future we fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing longterm debt and commercial paper by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking entities we seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses if our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding both of which could reduce our profitability particularly in our businesses that involve investing lending and market making our clients engaging in mergers acquisitions and other types of strategic transactions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions a lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size volume and timing of our clients merger and acquisition transactions particularly large transactions and adversely affect our advisory and underwriting businesses our credit businesses have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets a lack of liquidity reduces price transparency increases price volatility and decreases transaction volumes and size all of which can increase transaction risk or decrease the profitability of these businesses reductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding our credit ratings are important to our liquidity a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position increase our borrowing costs limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts under these provisions counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with us or require us to post additional collateral termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements as of december our counterparties could have called for additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements in an aggregate amount of million in the event of a onenotch downgrade of our credit ratings and billion in the event of a twonotch downgrade of our credit ratings a downgrade by any one rating agency depending on the agencys relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies for further information about our credit ratings see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management liquidity risk management credit ratings in part ii item of this form 10k our cost of obtaining longterm unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this funding changes in credit spreads are continuous marketdriven and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements our credit spreads are also influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to our longterm debt the market for credit default swaps has proven to be extremely volatile and at times has lacked a high degree of transparency or liquidity table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries group inc is a holding company and its liquidity depends on payments and loans from its subsidiaries many of which are subject to legal regulatory and other restrictions on providing funds or assets to group inc group inc is a holding company and therefore depends on dividends distributions loans and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund share repurchases and dividend payments and to fund payments on its obligations including debt obligations many of our subsidiaries including our brokerdealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc in addition our brokerdealer and bank entities and their subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses additional restrictions on relatedparty transactions increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts as well as lower earnings can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of group inc including under the frbs source of strength requirement and even require group inc to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries restrictions or regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc needs to make payments on its obligations including debt obligations or dividend payments in addition group incs right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors there has been a trend towards increased regulation and supervision of our subsidiaries by the governments and regulators in the countries in which those subsidiaries are located or do business concerns about protecting clients and creditors of financial institutions that are controlled by persons or entities located outside of the country in which such entities are located or do business have caused or may cause a number of governments and regulators to take additional steps to ring fence or require internal total lossabsorbing capacity which may also be subject to bailin powers as described below at those entities in order to protect clients and creditors of those entities in the event of financial difficulties involving those entities the result has been and may continue to be additional limitations on our ability to efficiently move capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities or to group inc including in times of stress thereby increasing the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis furthermore group inc has guaranteed the payment obligations of certain of its subsidiaries including gsco and gs bank usa subject to certain exceptions in addition group inc guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transactionbytransaction basis as negotiated with counterparties these guarantees may require group inc to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when group inc is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations the requirements for us and certain of our subsidiaries to develop and submit recovery and resolution plans to regulators and the incorporation of feedback received from regulators may require us to increase capital or liquidity levels or issue additional longterm debt at group inc or particular subsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or duplicative operational or other costs at multiple entities and may reduce our ability to provide group inc guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries or raise debt at group inc resolution planning may also impair our ability to structure our intercompany and external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient furthermore arrangements to facilitate our resolution planning may cause us to be subject to additional taxes any such limitations or requirements would be in addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions described above on our ability to engage in capital actions or make intercompany dividends or payments see business regulation in part i item of this form 10k for further information about regulatory restrictions table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries credit our businesses profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of or defaults by third parties we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will not perform their obligations these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons a failure of a significant market participant or even concerns about a default by such an institution could lead to significant liquidity problems losses or defaults by other institutions which in turn could adversely affect us we are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances in addition deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold including a deterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure their obligations to us under derivative contracts and loan agreements could result in losses andor adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes a significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results while in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets the termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights default rates downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral typically increase significantly in times of market stress increased volatility and illiquidity as part of our clearing and prime brokerage activities we finance our clients positions and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients although we have limits and regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our marketmaking underwriting investing and financing activities concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our marketmaking underwriting investing and financing activities the number and size of these transactions has affected and may in the future affect our results of operations in a given period moreover because of concentrated risk we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors disruptions in the credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or economically in addition we extend large commitments as part of our credit origination activities disruptions in the credit markets have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate the trading markets for loans we originate these disruptions may make it difficult for us to sell or value such assets which may result in losses for us from time to time rules adopted under the doddfrank act and similar rules adopted in other jurisdictions require issuers of certain assetbacked securities and any person who organizes and initiates certain assetbacked securities transactions to retain economic exposure to the asset which has affected the cost of and structures used in connection with these securitization activities our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling syndicating or securitizing these positions including during periods of market stress could negatively affect our results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions including due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of borrowers as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans in the ordinary course of business we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty borrower issuer including sovereign issuers or geographic area or group of related countries such as the eu and a failure or downgrade of or default by such entity could negatively impact our businesses perhaps materially and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities industries countries and regions may not function as we have anticipated regulatory reform including the doddfrank act has led to increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearinghouses central agents or exchanges which has significantly increased our concentration of risk with respect to these entities while our activities expose us to many different industries counterparties and countries we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties engaged in financial services activities including brokers and dealers commercial banks clearinghouses exchanges and investment funds this has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to these counterparties table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries derivative transactions and delayed documentation or settlements may expose us to credit risk unexpected risks and potential losses we are party to a large number of derivative transactions including credit derivatives many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and nonstandardized which can make exiting transferring or settling positions difficult many credit derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security loan or other obligation in order to receive payment in a number of cases we do not hold the underlying security loan or other obligation and may not be able to obtain the underlying security loan or other obligation this could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk as well as increased costs to us derivative transactions also involve the risk that documentation has not been properly executed that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty or that obligations under such agreements may not be able to be netted against other obligations with such counterparty in addition counterparties may claim that such transactions were not appropriate or authorized as a signatory to the isda universal protocol or us isda protocol isda protocols and being subject to the frbs and fdics rules on qfcs and similar rules in other jurisdictions we may not be able to exercise remedies against counterparties and as this regime has not yet been tested we may suffer risks or losses that we would not have expected to suffer if we could immediately close out transactions upon a termination event the isda protocols and these rules and regulations extend to repurchase agreements and other instruments that are not derivative contracts derivative contracts and other transactions including secondary bank loan purchases and sales entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a timely basis while the transaction remains unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce our rights in addition as new complex derivative products are created covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs the provisions of the doddfrank act requiring central clearing of credit derivatives and other otc derivatives or a market shift toward standardized derivatives could reduce the risk associated with these transactions but under certain circumstances could also limit our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and to hedge our own risks and could adversely affect our profitability in addition these provisions have increased our credit exposure to central clearing platforms operational a failure in our operational systems or human error malfeasance or other misconduct could impair our liquidity disrupt our businesses result in the disclosure of confidential information damage our reputation and cause losses our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor on a daily basis a very large number of transactions many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies these transactions as well as the information technology services we provide to clients often must adhere to clientspecific guidelines as well as legal and regulatory standards many rules and regulations worldwide govern our obligations to execute transactions and report such transactions and other information to regulators exchanges and investors compliance with these legal and reporting requirements can be challenging and we have been and may in the future be subject to regulatory fines and penalties for failing to follow these rules or to report timely accurate and complete information in accordance with these rules as reporting requirements expand compliance with these rules and regulations has become more challenging as our client base including through our consumer businesses and our geographical reach expand and the volume speed frequency and complexity of transactions especially electronic transactions as well as the requirements to report such transactions on a realtime basis to clients regulators and exchanges increase developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure has become more challenging and the risk of systems or human error in connection with such transactions has increased as have the potential consequences of such errors due to the speed and volume of transactions involved and the potential difficulty associated with discovering errors quickly enough to limit the resulting consequences these risks are exacerbated in times of increased volatility as with other similarly situated institutions we utilize credit underwriting models in connection with our businesses including our consumeroriented activities allegations or publicity whether or not accurate that our underwriting decisions do not treat consumers

use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows we increasingly face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay with respect to our clients systems there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents exchanges and clearinghouses and an increasing number of derivative transactions are cleared on exchanges which has increased our exposure to operational failure or significant operational delay termination or capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and costeffective alternatives in the event of any such failure delay termination or constraint industry consolidation whether among market participants or financial intermediaries increases the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay as disparate complex systems need to be integrated often on an accelerated basis the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents exchanges and clearinghouses and the increased centrality of these entities increases the risk that an operational failure at

impede their ability to provide products or services to us we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors use of common service providers additionally although the prevalence and scope of applications of distributed ledger technology cryptocurrency and similar technologies is growing the technology is nascent and may be vulnerable to cyber attacks

mobile and cloud technologies and as we provide more of these services to a greater number of individual consumers the migration of our communication from devices we provide to employeeowned devices presents additional risks of cyber attacks as do workfromhome arrangements in addition due to our interconnectivity with thirdparty vendors and their respective service providers central agents exchanges clearinghouses and other financial institutions we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event these impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the third party subject to the cyber attack or other information security event or could result in unauthorized access to or disclosure of client customer or other confidential information which could in turn interrupt certain of our businesses or adversely affect our results of operations and reputation despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information we may not be able to anticipate detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats including because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated change frequently and are often not recognized until launched cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources including third parties who are affiliated with or sponsored by foreign governments or are involved with organized crime or terrorist organizations third parties may also attempt to place individuals in our offices or induce employees clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data or that of our clients and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent although we take protective measures proactively and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access misuse computer viruses or other malicious code cyber attacks on our vendors and other events that could have a security impact risks relating to cyber attacks on our vendors have been increasing given the greater frequency and severity in recent years of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues in addition protective measures that we employ to compartmentalize our data may reduce our visibility into and adversely affect our ability to respond to cyber threats and issues with our systems if one or more of these types of events occur it potentially could jeopardize our our clients our counterparties or third parties confidential and other information processed stored in or transmitted through our computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or those of our clients counterparties or third parties which could impact their ability to transact with us or otherwise result in legal or regulatory action significant losses or reputational damage in addition such an event could persist for an extended period of time before being properly detected or escalated and following detection or escalation it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent amount and type of information compromised during the course of an investigation we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it and actions decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business results of operations and reputation moreover potential new regulations may require us to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident before it has been resolved or fully investigated we have expended and expect to continue to expend significant resources on an ongoing basis to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures but these measures may be ineffective and we may be subject to legal or regulatory action as well as financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us our clients confidential information may also be at risk from the compromise of clients personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company losses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our reputation and may have adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks as can workfromhome arrangements certain aspects of the security of such technologies are unpredictable or beyond our control and the failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation corruption or loss of confidential and other information in addition there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures despite their sophistication may be defeated particularly to the extent that new computing technologies vastly increase the speed and computing power available table start

management processes and strategies we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial credit operational compliance and legal reporting systems internal controls management review processes and other mechanisms our risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from marketmaking investing or lending positions and underwriting activities with our exposure to potential losses while we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes thus in the course of our activities we have incurred and may in the future incur losses market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk the models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated or conversely previously correlated indicators may move in different directions these types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses and they may do so in the future these changes in correlation have been and may in the future be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours in these and other cases it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets in addition the use of models in connection with risk management and numerous other critical activities presents risks that the models may be ineffective either because of poor design ineffective testing or improper or flawed inputs as well as unpermitted access to the models resulting in unapproved or malicious changes to the model or its inputs to the extent that we have positions through our marketmaking or origination activities or we make investments directly through our investing activities including private equity that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with those positions in addition to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation we invest our own capital in private equity credit real estate and hedge funds that we manage and limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of our investments in these funds whether for legal reputational or other reasons may make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures relating to these investments prudent risk management as well as regulatory restrictions may cause us to limit our exposure to counterparties geographic areas or markets which may limit our business opportunities and increase the cost of our funding or hedging activities as we have expanded and intend to continue to expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings of credit and investment products to consumers we are presented with different risks and must expand and adapt our risk monitoring and mitigation activities to account for these business activities a failure to adequately assess and

exercised its right described above to disregard the priority of creditor claims ola also provides the fdic with authority to cause creditors and shareholders of the financial company in receivership to bear losses before taxpayers are exposed to such losses and amounts owed to the us government would generally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims of private creditors including senior creditors in addition under ola claims of creditors including debtholders could be satisfied through the issuance of equity or other securities in a bridge entity to which group incs assets are transferred if such a securitiesforclaims exchange were implemented there can be no assurance that the value of the securities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or any part of the creditor claims for which the securities were exchanged while the fdic has issued regulations to implement ola not all aspects of how the fdic might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible in addition certain jurisdictions including the uk and the eu have implemented resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity such bailin powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured debtholders for example the bank of england requires a certain amount of intercompany funding that we provide to our material uk subsidiaries to contain a contractual trigger to expressly permit the bank of england to exercise such bailin powers in certain circumstances if the intercompany funding we provide to our subsidiaries is bailed in group incs claims on its subsidiaries would be subordinated to the claims of the subsidiaries thirdparty creditors or written down us regulators are considering and nonus authorities have adopted requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of total lossabsorbing capacity that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the toptier bhc and ultimately to security holders of the toptier bhc in the event of failure table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries the application of group incs proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for group incs security holders in our resolution plan group inc would be resolved under the us bankruptcy code the strategy described in our resolution plan is a variant of the single point of entry strategy group inc and goldman sachs funding llc funding ihc a whollyowned direct subsidiary of group inc would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries including through the forgiveness of intercompany indebtedness the extension of the maturities of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loans if this strategy were successful creditors of some or all of group incs major subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims while group incs security holders could face significant and possibly complete losses to facilitate the execution of our resolution plan we formed funding ihc in exchange for an unsecured subordinated funding note and equity interest group inc transferred certain intercompany receivables and substantially all of its gcla to funding ihc and agreed to transfer additional gcla above prescribed thresholds we also put in place a capital and liquidity support agreement clsa among group inc funding ihc and our major subsidiaries under the clsa funding ihc has provided group inc with a committed line of credit that allows group inc to draw sufficient funds to meet its cash needs during the ordinary course of business in addition if our financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent i the committed line of credit will automatically terminate and the unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven ii all intercompany receivables owed by the major subsidiaries to group inc will be transferred to funding ihc or their maturities will be extended to five years iii group inc will be obligated to transfer substantially all of its remaining intercompany receivables and gcla other than an amount to fund anticipated bankruptcy expenses to funding ihc and iv funding ihc will be obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to the major subsidiaries group incs and funding ihcs obligations under the clsa are secured pursuant to a related security agreement such actions would materially and adversely affect group incs liquidity as a result during a period of severe stress group inc might commence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier time than it otherwise would if the clsa and related security agreement had not been implemented if group incs proposed resolution strategy were successful group incs security holders could face losses while the thirdparty creditors of group incs major subsidiaries would incur no losses because those subsidiaries would continue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings as part of the strategy group inc could also seek to elevate the priority of its guarantee obligations relating to its major subsidiaries derivative contracts or transfer them to another entity so that crossdefault and early termination rights would be stayed under the isda protocols as applicable which would result in holders of group incs eligible longterm debt and holders of group incs other debt securities incurring losses ahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee obligations it is also possible that holders of group incs eligible longterm debt and other debt securities could incur losses ahead of other similarly situated creditors of group incs major subsidiaries if group incs proposed resolution strategy were not successful group incs financial condition would be adversely impacted and group incs security holders including debtholders may as a consequence be in a worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented in all cases any payments to debtholders are dependent on our ability to make such payments and are therefore subject to our credit risk as a result of our recovery and resolution

activities subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks including environmental reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs as part of our commodities business we purchase and sell certain physical commodities arrange for their storage and transport and engage in market making of commodities the commodities involved in these activities may include crude oil refined oil products natural gas liquefied natural gas electric power agricultural products metals base and precious minerals including unenriched uranium emission

and evolving federal state and local energy environmental antitrust and other governmental laws and regulations worldwide including environmental laws and regulations relating to among others air quality water quality waste management transportation of hazardous substances natural resources site remediation and health and safety additionally rising climate change concerns have led to additional regulation that could increase the operating costs and adversely affect the profitability of certain of our investments there may be substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations relating to our commoditiesrelated activities and investments compliance with these laws and regulations could require significant commitments of capital toward environmental monitoring renovation of storage facilities or transport vessels payment of emission fees and carbon or other taxes and application for and holding of permits and licenses commodities involved in our

failure of transport vessels storage facilities or other equipment or processes or other mechanical malfunctions fires leaks spills or release of hazardous substances performance below expected levels of output or efficiency terrorist attacks extreme weather events or other natural disasters or other hostile or catastrophic events in addition we rely on thirdparty suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual obligations and any failure on their part including the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to safely transport or store commodities could expose us to costs or losses also while we seek to insure against potential risks we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover some of these risks and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our losses the occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from performing under our agreements with clients may impair our operations or financial results and may result in litigation regulatory action negative publicity or other reputational harm we may also be required to divest or discontinue certain of these activities for regulatory or legal reasons or due to the transition to a less carbondependent economy in response to climate change competition our results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the composition of our client base our client base is not the same as that of our major competitors our businesses may have a higher or lower percentage of clients in certain industries or markets than some or all of our competitors therefore unfavorable industry developments or market conditions affecting certain industries or markets have resulted in the past and may result in the future in our businesses underperforming relative to similar businesses of a competitor if our businesses have a higher concentration of clients in such industries or markets for example our marketmaking businesses have a higher percentage of clients with actively managed assets than some of our competitors and such clients have in the past been and may in the future be disproportionately affected by low volatility correspondingly favorable or simply less adverse developments or market conditions involving industries or markets in a business where we have a lower concentration of clients in such industry or market have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in our underperforming relative to a similar business of a competitor that has a higher concentration of clients in such industry or market for example we have a smaller corporate client base in our marketmaking businesses than some of our peers and therefore those competitors may benefit more from increased activity by corporate clients similarly we have not historically engaged in retail equities intermediation to the same extent as other financial institutions which has in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our market share in equities execution the financial services industry is highly competitive the financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive and we expect them to remain so we compete on the basis of a number of factors including transaction execution our products and services innovation reputation creditworthiness and price there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry this has hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets as a result we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions as we have expanded into new business areas and new geographic regions we have faced competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients regulators and industry participants in the relevant market which could adversely affect our ability to expand our businesses table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries governments and regulators have adopted regulations imposed taxes adopted compensation restrictions or otherwise put forward various proposals that have impacted or may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a costeffective manner or at all in certain or all jurisdictions including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage these or other similar rules many of which do not apply to all our us or nonus competitors could impact our ability to compete effectively pricing and other competitive pressures in our businesses have continued to increase particularly in situations where some of our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing prices for example in connection with investment banking and other assignments in response to competitive pressure we have experienced we have extended and priced credit at levels that in some cases have not fully compensated us for the risks we undertook the financial services industry is highly interrelated in that a significant volume of transactions occur among a limited number of members of that industry many transactions are syndicated to other financial institutions and financial institutions are often counterparties in transactions this has led to claims by other market participants and regulators that such institutions have colluded in order to manipulate markets or market prices including allegations that antitrust laws have been violated while we have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and prevent such activities they may not be effective allegations of such activities particularly by regulators can have a negative reputational impact and can subject us to large fines and settlements and potentially significant penalties including treble damages the growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new products and technologies including trading and distributed ledger technologies including cryptocurrencies has increased competition technology is fundamental to our business and our industry the growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with new challenges securities futures and options transactions are increasingly occurring electronically both on our own systems and through other alternative trading systems and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue some of these alternative trading systems compete with us particularly our exchangebased marketmaking activities and we may experience continued competitive pressures in these and other areas in addition the increased use by our clients of lowcost electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads as our clients increasingly use our systems to trade directly in the markets we may incur liabilities as a result of their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure we have invested significant resources into the development of electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so but there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate return particularly given the generally lower commissions arising from electronic trades in addition the emergence adoption and evolution of new technologies including distributed ledgers such as digital assets and blockchain have required us to invest resources to adapt our existing products and services and we expect to continue to make such investments which could be material the adoption and evolution of such new technologies may also increase our compliance and regulatory costs further technologies such as those based on distributed ledgers that do not require intermediation could also significantly disrupt payments processing and other financial services regulatory limitations on our involvement in products and platforms involving digital assets and distributed ledger technologies may not apply equally or in some cases at all to certain of our competitors we may not be as timely or successful in developing or integrating or even able to develop or integrate new products and technologies such as those built on distributed ledgers into our existing products and services adapting to changes in consumer preferences or achieving market acceptance of our products and services any of which could affect our ability to attract or retain clients cause us to lose market share or result in service disruptions and in turn reduce our revenues or otherwise adversely affect us our businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled people therefore our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses to manage our businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new talented and diverse employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees factors that affect our ability to attract and retain such employees include the level and composition of our compensation and benefits and our reputation as a successful business with a culture of fairly hiring training and promoting qualified employees as a significant portion of the compensation that we pay to our employees is in the form of yearend discretionary compensation a significant portion of which is in the form of deferred equityrelated awards declines in our profitability or in the outlook for our future profitability as well as regulatory limitations on compensation levels and terms can negatively impact our ability to hire and retain highly qualified employees table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry including the technology industry for qualified employees has often been intense we have experienced increased competition in hiring and retaining employees to address the demands of our expanding consumeroriented businesses and our technology initiatives this is also the case in emerging and growth markets where we are often competing for qualified employees with entities that have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region laws or regulations in jurisdictions in which our operations are located that affect taxes on our employees income or the amount or composition of compensation or that require us to disclose our or our competitors compensation practices may also adversely affect our ability to hire and retain qualified employees in those jurisdictions as described further in business regulation compensation practices in part i item of this form 10k our compensation practices are subject to review by and the standards of the frb as a large global financial and banking institution we are subject to limitations on compensation practices which may or may not affect the companies with which we compete for talent by the frb the pra the fca the fdic and other regulators worldwide these limitations have shaped our compensation practices which has in some cases adversely affected our ability to attract and retain talented employees in particular in relation to companies not subject to these limitations and future legislation or regulation may have similar adverse effects our operating expenses and efficiency ratio depend in part on our overall headcount and the proportion of our

a less carbondependent economy may also have a negative impact on the operations or financial condition of our clients and counterparties which may decrease revenues from those clients and counterparties and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients and counterparties in addition climate change may impact the broader economy table start

relating to climate change or our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective insufficient or otherwise inappropriate our business reputation and efforts to recruit and retain employees

clients which may result in financial institutions coming under increased requirements and expectations regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending investment and advisory activities the frb has announced that we are among the six us financial institutions participating in a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise in and we also are subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements relating to climate change such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements the risks associated with and the perspective of regulators shareholders employees and other

countries outside russia and has proposed additional measures aimed at nonrussia owned businesses businesses in the us and globally have experienced shortages in materials and increased costs for

such as generating additional revenues achieving expense savings reducing operational risk exposures or using capital and funding more efficiently engaging in new activities exposes us to a variety of risks including that we may be unable to successfully develop new competitive efficient and effective systems and processes and hire and retain the necessary personnel due to our lack of historical experience with unsecured consumer lending our loan loss assumptions may prove to be incorrect and we may incur losses significantly above those which we originally anticipated in entering the business or in expanding the product offerings for the business in recent years we have invested and may continue to invest more in businesses that we expect will generate a higher level of more consistent revenues in order to develop and be able to offer consumer financial products that compete effectively we have made and may continue to make significant investments in technology and human capital resources in connection with our consumeroriented activities such investments and acquisitions may not be successful or have returns similar to our other businesses we may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits or synergies from acquisitions or other business initiatives in the time frames we expect or at all we have engaged in selective acquisitions and may continue to do so in the future and these acquisitions may individually or in the aggregate be material to us any future acquisitions could involve the issuance of common stock andor the payment of cash as consideration the success of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated synergies cost savings and growth opportunities we may face numerous risks and uncertainties in combining and integrating the relevant businesses and systems including the need to combine or separate accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with clients counterparties regulators and others in connection with acquisitions integration of acquired businesses is timeconsuming and could disrupt our ongoing businesses produce unforeseen regulatory or operating difficulties cause us to incur incremental expenses or require incremental financial management and other resources it is also possible that an acquisition once announced may not close due to the failure to satisfy applicable closing conditions such as the receipt of necessary shareholder or regulatory approvals there is no assurance that any of our acquisitions will be successfully integrated or yield all of the expected benefits and synergies in the time frames that we expect or at all if we are not able to integrate our acquisitions
