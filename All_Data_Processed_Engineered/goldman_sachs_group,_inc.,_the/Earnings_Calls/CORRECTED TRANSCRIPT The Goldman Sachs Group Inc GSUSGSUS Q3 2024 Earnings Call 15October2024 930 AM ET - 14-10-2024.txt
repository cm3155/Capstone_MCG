you may begin your conference david michael solomon chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you operator good morning everyone thank you all for joining us in the third quarter we produced net revenues of billion and generated earnings per share of an roe of and an rote of overall im pleased with our performance especially in a quarter where our results were impacted by selected items including the narrowing of our consumer footprint which reduced our roe by basis points our performance demonstrates the strength of our worldclass and interconnected franchises where we were effectively serving clients in a complex backdrop in global banking markets we remain the premier ma advisor and a leading global risk intermediary across investment banking corporates and sponsors remain actively engaged and we see significant pentup demand from our clients our backlog rose again this quarter driven by advisory and we expect our leading investment banking franchise to benefit from the continued resurgence in activity in ficc we delivered record financing revenues and facilitated our clients risk intermediation needs particularly as activity levels picked up towards the end of the quarter and in equities we reported a very strong performance across both intermediation and financing overall our global broad and deep platforms remain exceptionally well positioned to support our clients evolving needs across products and asset classes and in asset wealth management our position as a leading global active asset manager a top five alternatives player and a premier ultrahigh net worth franchise affords us significant opportunities in secular growth areas our assets under supervision reached another record this quarter surpassing trillion and representing our 27th consecutive quarter of longterm net inflows we demonstrated further growth in more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues which together were a record billion this quarter and up versus last year we remain confident in our ability to grow these more durable revenues at a high singledigit pace over the coming years in alternatives fundraising remains strong we raised over billion yeartodate and now expect fundraising to exceed billion as we see ongoing demand across asset classes including private credit private equity secondaries and infrastructure the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 in wealth management we grew our total client assets to trillion and our ultrahigh net worth franchise is wellpositioned to continue to grow globally as we expand our advisor footprint and our leading offerings and our lending offerings to clients our pretax margin in awm is up meaningfully from last year and in line with our mid target we remain focused on further improving the margins and returns in this business while also investing to drive growth across wealth management alternatives and solutions as i look at the operating backdrop the us economy continues to be resilient inflation has been coming down the recent unemployment data is supportive and while weve seen some softness in consumer behavior the tone of my recent conversations with clients has been quite constructive the beginning of the rate cut cycle has renewed optimism for a soft landing which should spur increased economic activity more broadly clients remain highly focused on the trajectory of rates in jurisdictions around the world the policy implications of global elections particularly in the us and the high levels of geopolitical instability against this backdrop our leading global franchises are supporting our clients as they navigate risks and position themselves for a range of outcomes before i turn it over to denis i want to spend a moment on capital and basel iii revisions although we have closely followed the recent remarks from regulatory officials about the upcoming reproposal we continue to have concerns about the overall regulatory process there remains a lack of transparency and appreciation for the interconnectedness of capital requirements across the proposed fundamental review of the trading book ccar and the gsib buffer we recognize this is an ongoing process that will take time but as weve said before we need to get this right the final rule will have a significant impact on the growth and competitiveness of the us economy requiring too much capital will increase the cost of credit for businesses large and small and will impact growth across the country we look forward to receiving more clarity from our regulators once the reproposal is published and participating in the new comment period we remain very engaged both as an industry and as a firm in closing i feel very good about the trajectory of goldman sachs we are leaning into our strengths our client franchise is stronger than ever and we continue to harness our one goldman sachs approach our worldclass talent execution capabilities and risk management expertise are core to who we are as a firm and allow us to provide differentiated service to our clients and outperform for shareholders through the cycle let me now turn it over to denis to cover our financial results in more detail denis p coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david good morning lets start with our results on page of the presentation in the third quarter we generated net revenues of billion up yearoveryear earnings per share of up yearover year our roe was and an rote of as david mentioned our results were impacted by select items including agreements to transition the gm card platform and to sell our portfolio of seller financing loans in aggregate these items reduced eps by and our roe by basis points now turning to performance by segment starting on page global banking markets produced revenues of billion in the third quarter advisory revenues of million were up both sequentially and versus the prior year period we remain number one in the league tables for announced and completed ma for the yeartodate equity underwriting revenues rose yearoveryear to million as equity capital markets have continued to reopen though volumes are still well below longer term averages the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 debt underwriting revenues rose yearoveryear to million amid higher leveraged finance and investmentgrade activity we are seeing increased client demand for committed acquisition financing which we expect to continue on the back of increasing ma activity overall our investment banking backlog rose quarter onquarter driven by advisory ficc net revenues of billion in the quarter were down from a strong performance last year amid a relatively quieter summer though we saw a meaningful pickup in activity in september a decline in intermediation revenues was partially offset by record ficc financing revenues of million which rose yearoveryear primarily on better results within mortgages and structured lending equities net revenues were billion in the quarter up versus the prior year equities intermediation revenues were billion up yearoveryear primarily driven by strong performance across derivatives and cash products equities financing revenues of billion rose versus the prior year amid higher average balances across ficc and equities financing revenues were a record billion for the yeartodate a direct result of the successful execution on our strategic priority to improve the durability of our revenue base moving to asset wealth management on page revenues of billion were up yearoveryear our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this quarter of billion management and other fees increased sequentially to a record billion for the quarter and billion for the yeartodate well on the way to achieving our billion annual target for private banking and lending revenues rose sequentially to million we are seeing positive momentum in this business and we remain focused on increasing lending penetration and expanding our loan product offerings incentive fees for the quarter were million we continue to expect to reach our annual target of billion over the mediumterm supported by approximately billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of the last quarter equity and debt investments revenues totaled million reflecting nii in our debt portfolio and markups in our public equity portfolio for the yeartodate we generated billion in combined equity and debt investments revenues now moving to page total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of trillion bolstered by billion of liquidity products net inflows and billion of longterm net inflows across asset classes we continue to see traction in our solutions business where we are leveraging our sma capabilities and outsourced cio platform to deliver customized multiasset solutions turning to page on alternatives alternative aus totaled billion at the end of the third quarter driving million in management and other fees gross thirdparty fundraising was billion in the third quarter and over billion for the yeartodate this brings cumulative thirdparty fundraising to more than billion since our investor day in we further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by billion in the third quarter to billion bringing yeartodate reductions to billion on page firmwide net interest income was billion in the quarter up versus the prioryear period reflecting an increase in interestearning assets our total loan portfolio at quarterend was billion up yearoveryear driven by an increase in other collateralized lending for the third quarter our provision for credit losses was million primarily driven by net chargeoffs in our credit card portfolio and partially offset by million of net recoveries on previously impaired wholesale loans the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 turning to expenses on page total quarterly operating expenses were billion our yeartodate compensation ratio net of provisions is quarterly noncompensation expenses were billion down yearoveryear we remain focused on driving efficiencies across the firm given ongoing inflationary pressures competition for talent and our desire to invest in our engineering and technology platforms our effective tax rate for the first nine months of was for the full year we continue to expect a tax rate of approximately next capital on slide in the quarter we returned billion to common shareholders including dividends of million and stock repurchases of billion our common equity tier ratio was at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach during the quarter the federal reserve reduced our scb requirement by basis points to following a successful appeal process resulting in a standardized common equity tier ratio requirement of which became effective october we remain very engaged with our regulators on creating a less volatile and more transparent process given our basis point buffer we continue to have flexibility on capital deployment and are very wellpositioned to serve our clients and return capital to shareholders in conclusion our overall performance reflected the strength of our client franchise and the improving operating environment we are executing on our strategy where we are maintaining and strengthening our leadership positions across global banking markets and leaning into secular growth opportunities in asset wealth management across both businesses we are making strong progress in growing our more durable revenue streams simply put we are playing to our strength as a firm and we remain confident in our ability to drive returns for shareholders while continuing to support our clients with that well now open up the line for questions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much so trading question i mean the markets business has been great markets have been supportive but i guess my question is is to your comments on the regulatory perception perhaps of trading in general and august looked like a spike in volatility but it looks like you did really well this marks many quarters that you and others have done very well for years do you feel the business is managed better do you feel like your results mean anything towards the outcome on the regulatory side im just curious on what the if the evidence matters david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i appreciate the question glenn and i mean its a hard question to answer i think weve been clear on some of the advocacy were doing around the regulatory process but ive also been clear that regulatory environments ebb and flow and that people can be policy and so over time you see shifts in all this and our job i think weve done this effectively over a very long period of time is to adapt and adjust and be nimble to the different regulatory environments with respect to the business of markets which includes ficc intermediation and ficc financing and equities intermediation and equities financing i think we have an extraordinary leading franchise that weve invested in over a long period of time we have deep deep client relationships clients who rely on us for a package of services and thats not going away and certainly in this environment this is an environment thats filled with uncertainty their need to constantly be engaging and repositioning and reshaping continues to make them very very active on a broad global scale i think that weve done a number of things to evolve the way we run the business over time that i think have made the business more durable certainly our focus and our emphasis on financing and the way weve grown and managed the financing businesses puts a level of durability into the business thats different than when the businesses were predominantly intermediation businesses but intermediation continues to be an important service and when you really step back and you step out of quartertoquarter and you look more yeartoyear or yearoveryear these are very broad franchises across numerous silos and they tend to be more resilient and more consistent than one might see when you look quartertoquarter so we feel good about the way the franchise is positioned well continue to invest in it and grow it i think one of the things that people forget is that these businesses are correlated to growth in the world theyre correlated to market cap growth in the world and as long as you believe over the medium and longterm those trends will continue with our capital generation we have the ability to invest in those franchises and grow those franchises over time and we continue to see attractive return opportunities to do that how the regulators respond to that over time i really think is a separate question and well continue to be actively engaged as weve said as weve said to you we are to ensure that we can manage that appropriately the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate that this one will be a short followup with hpi was weak but thatll happen on any given quarter i think if you look over a long period of time youve earned good returns on your historical principal investments but as that book shrinks the billion thats left the billion attributed to it if i take a should i is it okay to take a historical roeish on that capital to think about the lower revenue corresponding to the lower book going forward on hpi denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so glenn its denis i guess what i would suggest you take a look at we have obviously a commitment to reducing the balance of the historical principal investments and as we continue to have success doing that there will be less revenue associated with the positions that have now been moved off of the balance sheet but you will still see revenue generation associated with some of the coinvest positions that we retain as a piece of driving our overall growth of our thirdparty fund management business as to guidance on future projected returns on that portfolio i dont think i have a good answer as to exactly what future returns will be relative to prior returns but i would suggest to you that we have a very diversified portfolio of exposures and a longstanding track record of delivering good returns for our clients operator thank you well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i just had a followup first on trading and maybe david would appreciate your perspective around when we read about nonbank trading venues getting into fixed income markets potentially sort of disrupting the business for the incumbents comment on that if you could in terms of are there parallels to the equity business that we should draw and how much of a competitive threat are the nonbanknonregulated entities especially given your comments around the regulatory backdrop and kind of the basel endgame reproposal and the opaqueness around that thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah sure ebrahim and i appreciate the question and this gets a lot of attention particularly in the press but i think there are a couple of things when you stand back that are important to think about and look the equities journey is a relatively good journey theres been lots of first of all theres lots of competition in all these businesses theres always been competition but there are very few platforms that offer the leading capital allocators and asset managers in the world the scale and the breadth across all the services that they need in an integrated basis and thats very very important to those clients when you go out and you talk to those clients there can always be competition and there always will be competition id just highlight our equity business is as large and as scaled and as profitable as ever even though over the last years theres been enormous competition in the equity business theres been digitization theres been change there are now a handful and by a handful id say less than a handful there are now one or two players that are trying to compete in some of the credit spaces et cetera the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 and will they compete and will they win business of course theyll win business but these are big big markets we offer scaled solutions that are integrated for our clients and we continue to be enormous liquidity provider financier of those clients which by the way is very very important to them for the way their overall ecosystem works so while these businesses always will be competitive and they continue to be competitive again we feel very good about the way our franchise is positioned to continue to be a leading player for our clients in these spaces ebrahim h q poonawala analyst bofa securities inc understood and then just a followup on back to roe and conversation with investors around you all have done a good job over the last year or two performance has been strong stocks reflected that as we think about the journey here from a roe to something thats maybe 15plus what are the building blocks one could argue that the market backdrop not the best but not the worst what needs to happen for goldman to get to a point where we are registering a type roe on a more recurring basis thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i appreciate the question and weve been very clear we have a midteens target and that we believe we are on the journey of executing toward it i think the first thing that has to happen is we need to continue to execute over a period of time to deliver on that and again i think its a pretty simple building block of a story first we have a global banking markets business and you can go look at the performance over the last five years of that business and the returns that that business has delivered i would say that i still believe we have some tailwind dynamics around the investment banking activity and id just highlight that while investment banking revenues have improved and weve made progress we are still not operating at 10year averages in ma and equity volumes ma volumes yeartodate are below 10year averages now thats better than the below 10year averages that they were for the first nine months of last year and equity volumes at below 10year averages now thats better than the that they were below 10year averages for the first nine months last year but theres no reason why were not going to get back to 10year averages and thats a tailwind but you can look at the performance in banking markets and thats one building block in the foundation for midteens returns the second is our continued progress which requires more time and more execution on our part around asset wealth management and while weve improved the margins we still have work to do on the margins and also the returns and we continue to be very focused but we are confident over the course of the next few years that we can bring the returns of our asset wealth management franchise into the midteens the next building block or the last building block is we continue to narrow our consumer footprint and the drag associated with the platforms the platform business that will get to a point where it basically becomes negligible its getting closer to that and so if you put those building blocks together global banking markets its actual performance was a little bit more of a tailwind which obviously it benefits from continued progress on asset wealth management that is our business and we should be able to deliver those returns were focused on it we have more work to do but that is the path and i think its pretty clear operator thank you well take our next question from christian bolu with autonomous research the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning can you hear me good morning can you hear me okay david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yes we can christian thank you christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp okay david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yes we can christian thank you christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp just another question on the trading business and the competitive landscape how are you thinking about the maybe the broader competitive landscape with the with other banks your market share seemed to peak in its been a bit choppy since then as a market share just curious are you seeing signs of competitors coming back increasing competition from anywhere id just be curious on your thoughts there david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc when you have leading market shares in our global banking markets franchise you bounce around at different levels based on shortterm activity but what id say is if you step back and you look over the last five years we took a step function up in our market shares broadly across the plot and so from quartertoquarter youll see variability but i still think those market shares are positioned in a leading position and were zealously focused on them were zealously focused on the top clients which obviously make a huge contribution in the markets business were obviously always focused on our overall banking footprint and the opportunities there and obviously in a better ma environment where theres more largecap ma you do see some movement in our market shares and thats a market share tailwind for us theyve always been competitive businesses christian again we think were very wellpositioned with our clients and have deep trusting longterm relationships and through our one goldman sachs operating ethos a history of delivering for them through the cycle theres always going to be competition but we like the way our business is positioned and i dont see anything that fundamentally changes that but ive operated in these businesses weve operated in these businesses for a long time theyre always going to be competitive businesses christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thank you on private banking just another set of very strong results there i think revenue growth up and if im doing my math correctly organic flows are in the high singledigit range which would put you i think bestinclass so just remind us again like whats driving strength there and then maybe any key initiatives for growth over the next couple of years that should help sustain this growth the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so ill start and i dont know denis might have something to add but on a high level this is a strategic decision that we had this big ultrahigh net worth platform and we were underinvested in lending to those clients and theres a lot of historical reasons for why thats the case starting with the fact that years ago we werent a bank and so we really didnt look at the world that way but lending into an ultrahigh net worth franchise is a very good business and its a very important part of the business and we understand and weve learned and weve seen it through investment banking and weve seen it through markets that when you holistically look at the integration of services that you provide to your clients including lending you improve your market share position so when you look at our wealth franchise versus other wealth franchises weve been underpenetrated for lending to those wealth clients and we put in place resources a leadership team and a focused effort to increase that activity to these clients and while weve moved the needle were still underweighted versus other competitors like jpmorgan and i would expect that we have a relatively good growth trajectory and continue to invest in that capability for our client set and denis i dont know if theres anything you want to add on that denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the only thing id amplify which i think weve mentioned before we feel like weve run this play before so we worked on a strategy to holistically cover clients in banking by integrating lending as part of the holistic suite of services we provided them and improved our market share position with those clients weve implemented the same thing across the gbm public businesses of ficc and equities we stand underpenetrated relative to peers today and we believe that by taking the same holistic approach to clients in the wealth business that we can improve our market shares and the nature of our relationship with those clients as david said we are allocating incremental resources more specialist capabilities and giving our advisors the confidence to offer a competitive product to their clients to improve the overall relationship they have with their clients operator thank you well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi the first question relates to why do you still have platform solutions as a business line and whats happening with the apple card and do you plan to exit that and take charges for that and kind of whats going on with that again twothirds of the firms global banking markets onethird is wealth asset management and then you have this kind of extra business there david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah thanks mike i mean i know theres a lot of focus on that i think weve been pretty clear in our messaging that we are continuing to narrow our consumer footprint i dont have a lot more to say about where we are with apple card other than were running it improving it and thats really all that i have to say but i think the direction of travel at this point is pretty clear the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well back to the core business then you said ma is still below 10year averages to what degree are year averages less relevant because of the sponsor activity you guys have said it seems like everyone has a different number whether its trillion or trillion of dry powder out there by sponsors that are ready willing and able to pursue acquisitions and i dont think youve ever had that level of dry powder before so could this be an ma supercycle because all that money gets put to work and if so how would you change that 10year average to adjust for that david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well if i mean one i think there are longterm secular trends around ma and market cap which by the way are also meaningfully below trend i think thats more driven by the current regulatory environment and the fact that there has not been a lot of largecap ma with the market cap expansion especially around tech that might be permanent it might not but my guess is that will ebb and flow from time to time but your sponsor point mike is a very very good point and the bottom line is the sponsors have been slower to turn on than i would have expected but they will turn on by the way if all that dry powder is deployed okay ma volumes versus the 10year averages will go up but by the way if we were sitting here years ago the year average was lower years ago than it is today because the 10year average is definitely correlated to market cap growth and economic growth so i do think well operate at 10year averages i do think over time by the end of the decade the 10year average will actually be higher than its been with a historical lens but i will say to your sponsor point slower to deploy than we would have expected but we see more activity some of that is indicative of the growth in our backlog that weve highlighted and i do think that sponsor activity will continue to accelerate over the next months operator thank you well go next to betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning can you hear me okay david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay great david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc we can betsy the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yes okay super yeah i totally agree weve been calling for capital markets rebound and its really nice to see it coming through two questions one on the expanding loan offerings that you mentioned earlier and i know we touched on it briefly in the qa just a few questions ago what i wanted to make sure i understood is when you think about the rwa impact of reducing the private investments that youre doing reducing that portfolio and then increasing the expanded loan offerings into asset wealth management do you see that as rwa neutral is the density of the loan offerings higher or lower than the investment the private equity investments that youve got denis p a coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure betsy very good question so generally speaking the density of the hpi that we have left to sell down is high and the density of private wealth loans is low so migrating rwa deployment towards the lending businesses improves the durability the predictability the recurring nature of it it brings forth the holistic access to the clients all of their all their wealth management needs and it is more capitalefficient for us so that is betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc great the other denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc that is an underpinning component of the strategy as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay super right because its collateralized heavily right okay then the other question i had was just on the gm credit i want to make sure i understood this so as far as i can tell its signed but not closed yet so can you give us a sense as to when you think its going to close and are there any trailers in your pl once it does close for example anything we should be aware of with regard to either payments on the contract to gm or is there like a loss cap that you have to be involved in im just trying to make sure i understand how to model this as we go forward denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 sure betsy so in terms of timing its signed but not closed there has to be a conversion to the new issuer and then ultimately a closing of the platform transfer expectations were targeting  of so thats sort of timing from a modeling perspective and i guess what i would tell we obviously have responsibility for operating the platform up until that point in time so we will continue to incur call it the runrate operating losses associated with that business as a guide id point you to where we were in  and  of this year something on the order of negative million or million per quarter just to give you a sense for how that rolls forward from here till closing operator thank you well go next to brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question i wanted to follow up a little bit on the investment banking backlog commentary i know you said that advisory drove a lot of the growth in the backlog but we did see some sponsors recently come to the ipo market with some success and so curious about what youre seeing on the ecm and ipo side particularly as we see early signs of sponsors reengaging with that distribution channel thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so thanks for the question brennan i mean theres no question equity activity picked up but as i highlighted a few moments ago volumes are still running below 10year averages and ipos running even more significantly below 10year averages i do think the sponsors again some of this is sponsor monetization and because sponsors have had their portfolios marked a little bit higher theyve been slow and theyre kind of waiting for growth to bring up some of the values but i do see an acceleration of activity and i expect it to continue and theres no fundamental reason why equity volumes ultimately shouldnt run at 10year averages and if those averages will grow over time with the growth in market cap and a growth in the deployment of sponsor capital brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color david and then weve seen several partnerships and some innovation getting announced in the private credit world recently given your heritage in that business how do you plan to approach and prosecute that opportunity david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure we have a very broad and interesting credit platform that is integrated in a one gs way to some degree and a differentiated way than many of the people we compete with we obviously as a credit originator in our investment banking business are one of the leading credit originators weve had a leading position in leveraged loans and highyield debt for quite some time and a leading position with sponsors and the origination of that we obviously we originate and distribute we also in our asset management business we are a leading player in private credit with billion of private credit assets and growing and investing in that i think one of the things thats interesting when you look at the discussion and the integration of this around the street there is plenty of capital that is interesting and deploying into private credit the valuable part of the ecosystem is origination channels and there are obviously some private credit players that have interesting the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 origination channels and platforms but i would say when you look across goldman sachs our origination ecosystem across both our global banking networks sic markets business and also in our asset wealth management business is unique and differentiated and something that i think will continue to differentiate the firm as we continue to lean into and grow our private credit platform operator thank you well go next to steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so wanted to spend some time david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc wanted to spend some time just looking at or unpacking some of the selfhelp levers recognizing that the business is still burdened by capital consumption from some of the noncore assets whether its in consumer or equity investments denis i believe in your prepared remarks you alluded to an bps drag on roe from consumer and was hoping you could maybe provide a more holistic picture just frame the drag on returns from various noncore activities today and are there any remaining selfhelp levers that could bolster returns which may still be on the come denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i think the basis point drag is the simplest way to understand the impact of those items which we have identified as the selected items which we have announced were in the process of disposing of obviously if we complete if we were to completely exit all consumerrelated activities there would be more associated capital relief potential and we can obviously across the awm franchise move down the vast majority of the hpi exposure that currently has a little over billion of attributed equity associated with it so you have the dynamic of sort of reducing the pl components and then over time we will remove the capital so removing the capital associated with hpi and then ultimately removing the capital associated with the consumer businesses that will provide incremental tailwinds to us over time steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great and just for a followup on buybacks just the stock is currently trading at times book it does suggest some expectation in the market for returns to get closer to that midteens roe target just wanted to hear your perspective on price sensitivity to buyback at current valuation levels and in anticipation at least of davids response citing prioritization of organic growth where do you see the most attractive opportunities to deploy capital organically today denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 sure so i think our capital deployment philosophy unchanged i think if you take some of our comments in the prepared remarks about the outlook that we have some of the engagement were seeing from clients potential opportunities for the capital markets reopening to take the next step forward and see capital committed acquisition financing that is an activity thats very core to goldman sachs we have a historical leading market share position there given knitting up our advisory franchise and our underwriting capabilities and so that would be an attractive place for us to deploy incremental capital continuing to drive the recurring revenue streams across wealth and the financing business and public is an attractive place to deploy capital and that is our priority as we sit here today with our basis point buffer heading into the fourth quarter but we also remain very committed as weve said before to sustainably growing our dividend thats a core part of our philosophy and we do believe its important to also continue to return capital to shareholders we do have a higher valuation we do think about that we are sensitive to that but i dont believe that our current valuation is such that we shouldnt be also returning capital to shareholders operator thank you well go next to devin ryan with citizens jmp devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc thanks so much good morning david and denis a question on just the alternative asset management fundraising and looking at the fee rate so the largest alt bucket corporate equity has seen a declining fee rate since the end of i know there were some legacy funds in there that are sunsetting but it would just be great to get an update on the outlook for the fee rate just given all that fundraising that youve done in alts in recent years and just when we should think about the inflection occurring as recently raised aum moves into fee earning and then how we should think about kind of the right steady state because it would seem like theres a lot of upside there denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you appreciate the question obviously we put that disclosure out there so you can track it and follow it over time its obviously very much mixdependent in terms of the nature of the particular alts assets that are coming in one thing which is a strategic initiative that is very valuable to growth of our asset management franchise and important to a lot of our investment banking and other clients are the services we provide to our ocio offerings but in certain of those portfolios we do bring onboard some alts assets and the effective fee associated with that is lower than call it a goldman sachs fund generated alternative fee so we have a multichannel asset accumulation strategy that were deploying to grow the overall scale and scope of that business and for us having scale is an important contributor ultimately to driving margins efficiencies and returns in the business but not each of the channels comes with the same exact effective fee so you may see some slight variation in that over time devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities llc okay thanks denis and then just a followup on the trading business obviously results have been incredibly resilient and the firm is gaining market share so wanted to get a little bit of a flavor if you can just around how much of trading revenue today is driven by your electronic trading capabilities and how thats evolved over the past handful of years i know theres been a lot of investment there and you guys have some pretty differentiated the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 offerings so would just love to get a little bit of sense of that and then how that plays into the story of market share from here just as you become more relevant with clients thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you thanks for the question i mean when you look at equity and frankly even ficc trading activities the strategy facing clients is multichannel again so we have voice we have high touch voice and we have electronic and increasingly were finding ways to integrate those activities to optimize ultimately the way that we can make markets and deliver solutions for clients so we have both runrate more plain vanilla intermediation activities and then we have the capacity to either take onboard more interesting structured or complicated trades with or without deployment of risk capital in the process and the approach is to have a distributed set of channels across the public side trading businesses operator thank you well go next to dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning denis i want to come back to a comment you made about reiterating the billion goal for performance fees and i think you said billion of unrecognized gains youre obviously runrating well below that here yeartodate can you talk about the time period you think to get to that billion and is there seasonality with certain maybe liquid products that are typically more recognized in the fourth quarter or is this something that should be more pro rata denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so the billion is versus the stock of outstanding funds that are in process of deploying completing harvesting and migrating their way to the end of their investment cycle given a lot of the other commentary that weve been discussing about level of activity strategically openness of capital markets in particular equity capital markets sponsor monetization activity et cetera as it relates to our portfolio where we own some balance sheet investments and we own investments in funds we have not had as much monetization in line with where the market has been generally so as activity improves we will also see more monetization and we expect that over the next several years we will move towards those mediumterm targets of a runrate billion worth of incentive fees but i cant tell you exactly the rate at which that comes in thatll be dependent on how ultimately these funds harvest and when were in a position to ultimately pay carry to investors and recognize our own incentive fees daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc got it and then just a followup on wealth management understanding the strategy of growing lending but can you talk about the growth overall of the advisor base and how youre thinking about that over the next kind of one to two years in terms of net recruiting hires and ultimately investment in that business beyond just diversifying the revenue streams denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 sure so i think we have made a strategic decision that the investment in advisors needs to be a strategic and sustained investment program so rather than having it sort of ebb and flow across different market environments or based on what the firms perceived capacity to invest may or may not have been at different years in the past i think part of the strategy of investing in what is an really outstanding business at goldman sachs where were the premier ultrahigh net worth firm we are making a sustained commitment to invest in advisors over multiple years and so that is sort of a foundational underpinning of how were looking to invest in that business and when david makes comments about our ability to drive growth and returns across awm and that we are focused not just on margins and returns but investing to grow one of the places that we think is an attractive place to invest and grow is actually in the advisor footprint operator thank you well go next to gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi denis hi david can you guys share with us goldmans in a unique position i think to be able to share with investors the benefits of private credit i think david you mentioned you have billion in private credit assets and when you see your clients choosing a channel to access monies from you whether its private credit or just lending can you share with us the advantages that you see through private credit or the regular loan portfolio that your customers may benefit from david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so i appreciate the question gerard i think one of the things thats interesting about this is this gets framed in very binary ways and obviously private credit is a broad term and it refers to a lot of things it certainly refers to a lot of investmentgrade lending a lot of which is on insurance company balance sheets it can refer to direct lending in the below investmentgrade business which by the way is a component of our syndication activity and origination activity particularly with sponsors it can be direct lending for small and mediumsize enterprises so theres a wide range of things when i listened to your question what i pull away is youre asking in particular about leveraged finance activity and how our clients choose channels in terms of where to get capital and id say they dont go in with a bias theyre actually looking for a capital structure that works for their particular solution and i think that one of the things that positions us well is we are a unique player that we have an ability to either syndicate and underwrite and distribute we have an ability to direct lend we have an ability to show clients alternatives that can best meet their needs and their needs might be different in different transactional situations so we like our positioning there i do say that i believe from a secular perspective therell be continued growth in private credit particularly in the leveraged finance space and so were looking to capture that but its more complicated there are different channels theres different origination efforts than sometimes the way this is all portrayed but we feel like were wellpositioned across the spectrum to be a significant participant in the space gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and david just a quick followup on that that was very thorough who do you find is your primary competitors again youre in a unique position i think to be able to benefit from this who do you bump into the most the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well it depends what youre doing so it goes back to exactly what i said it depends what youre doing if youre in the leveraged finance market and youre looking at a syndicated capital structure and youre competing for that youre going to bump into jpmorgan for example if on the other hand youre looking at direct lenders then youre going to bump into a bunch of people that play a leading role in that space which can include people like hps or ares or other direct platforms if youre looking at investmentgrade insurance company balance sheet you might run into apollo i mean it really depends on who the client is what their need is and what the activity is and its actually quite a broad and complicated space denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc and the only thing id add to it gerard if you just think about it i think davids laid this out really well if you think about where goldman sachs is positioned against this opportunity set we have capacity to lend to alternatives clients for example who are deploying into the private credit space we have the capacity to underwrite and distribute different types of investmentgrade and noninvestmentgrade capital structures and we have the capacity to offer investment opportunities to clients who want to get exposure to this asset class and while we compete with all of those different parties that david enumerated im hardpressed to find many people that have the breadth of exposure to each aspect of this ecosystem relative to us so we really like our position in terms of the secular trends there and how we can support clients in each and every aspect of the continuum operator thank you well take our next question from saul martinez with hsbc saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi good morning i wanted to ask about the margin trajectory in asset wealth management yeartodate youre at youve got a pretax margin youve already essentially reached the mid20 mediumterm target i know you talked about that margin expanding beyond the mid but how do we think about where it can ultimately land and the time horizon around it obviously youre growing your alts business you have billion of unrecognized incentive fees you talked about the private banking and lending platform just can you get to a pretax margin of above like your peers and again how do we think about the glide path from here and the time horizon around that denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you saul so obviously weve just arrived at our mid target i think its important that we consolidate our position there we think there are plenty of opportunities to continue to drive that margin higher as we scale top line as we improve the mix of alternatives across our platform and we look to drive other operating efficiencies across the business segment there are plenty of competitors that have margins as you cite that are or higher so our commitment is to continue to improve the margins but were also thinking increasingly about opportunities we have to scale and create value for the longterm so we are going to try and find the balance between incremental margin improvement and making the right investment decisions that unlock long term value in this segment but for the time being we think that both can be achieved saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2024 okay got it thanks thats helpful and then maybe if i could follow up on capital and just how youre thinking i know you talked about your capital strategy a bit but how are you thinking about just capital allocation and buybacks given the uncertainty around basel we have the proposal we have the speech outlining a reproposal we have an agency that seemingly one of the agencies obviously resisting seemingly the reproposal we have an election that could play a big role in terms of influencing whatever outcome happens so just how are you thinking about your capital and why do you think the basis point buffer is the right buffer given all that uncertainty denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc okay thank you look what i i would say for the last period of quarters and years weve been operating in an environment with a bunch of regulatory uncertainty theres also been operating uncertainty as well i think the economic trajectory outlook and client franchise is coming more into focus frankly that presents opportunities so we run a buffer so that we have pentup capacity to support incoming client opportunities but we also run the buffer given other uncertainties in the world which include regulatory as to when we will have the next bit of clarity and be able to interpret exactly what that means for our capital position i couldnt tell you right now but we have a long history of making adjustments to our activities when we get that regulatory feedback from everything we know there are generally timelines associated with those rules coming into effect and we feel like this is the right place to run our capital to support the client franchise and be prepared for other unexpected developments including regulatory operator thank you at this time there are no additional questions ladies and gentlemen this concludes the goldman sachs third quarter
