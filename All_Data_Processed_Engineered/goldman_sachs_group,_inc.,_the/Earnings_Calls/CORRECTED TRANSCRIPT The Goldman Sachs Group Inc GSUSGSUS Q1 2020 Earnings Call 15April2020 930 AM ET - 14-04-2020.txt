banks governments and regulators we commend the rapid forceful and unprecedented fiscal and regulatory responses designed to ensure liquid and wellfunctioning capital markets and to provide emergency

and the us government along with the ecb bank of england and other global the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 central banks have sent a clear message that they will decisively support the broader economy with the global banking system as an active partner goldman sachs alongside many other financial institutions is prepared to play our part to help communities and businesses both small and large suffering from the economic impact of this devastating health crisis we are harnessing our resources experience and network to help where we can we are working with public and private sector clients to partner on new initiatives with a focus on community assistance and economic support for businesses and serving our clients and customers for our part weve taken a number of important steps including making a million commitment to covid19 relief efforts we will help small business owners weather this challenging time through million for small business loans and million in grants to community development financial institutions who have a long track record of reaching underserved communities and businesses we have worked with many of these missiondriven lenders for years through our small business sic small businesses program in addition we launched a covid19 relief fund with million commitment through goldman sachs gives including a special employeematching grant program to help healthcare workers families and the most vulnerable populations lastly in response to the well publicized shortage of equipment for health professionals we continue to donate supplies to frontline workers who need them most across the us and europe we have donated million surgical masks and n95 masks which we acquired over a number of years following prior epidemics like sars as a part of our operational risk management efforts as the situation rapidly evolves we will continue to adapt our response while supporting the broader financial systems our clients our people and our communities more broadly these are defining times for organizations adversity compels us to innovate to leverage new technologies and to find new ways of thinking and interacting at goldman sachs weve always prided ourselves on doing that to help our clients succeed and we continue to execute on this commitment as we move forward with that context i will turn to the quarter on page of the earnings presentation to discuss our financial results in the first quarter net revenues were billion roughly flat versus a year ago net earnings were billion resulting in an earnings per share of and roe of and a return on tangible equity of the first quarter proved to be two very different operating periods with a solid january and february followed by a challenging and volatile backdrop in march in both contexts our franchise businesses performed well from a client perspective we maintained our leading position as a strategic advisor to our investment banking clients in period of stress we delivered solid growth in ficc and equities on high levels of client engagement as we extended balance sheet liquidity to clients during the most volatile markets in march we continued to advise our wealth management clients and accelerated deposit growth in our digital consumer banking business in asset management we saw a direct impact from market dislocation as our on balance sheet equity and debt investments experienced material marktomarket losses from falling asset prices we also recognized higher credit losses and bolstered our reserves challenges notwithstanding we maintained a strong and highly liquid balance sheet with capital ratios above our minimums and robust levels of liquidity importantly our franchise remains strong and we feel wellpositioned to deliver bestinclass advice execution and risk expertise to every client engagement the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 turning to the operating environment on page the financial markets started the year on solid footing fueled by continued economic growth and strong consumer sentiment our business performed well in both january and february as markets notched new highs driven by client confidence and activity this backdrop however deteriorated with unprecedented speed in early march as financial markets began to ph price sensitive the severe risks from the spread of covid19 across the globe and the dramatic measures needed to contain it we witnessed spikes and volatility across most financial assets and global markets the sp declined sharply from alltime highs in february and the vix hit new highs we also witnessed significant widening of credit spreads in both investmentgrade and highyield and derisking from clients across all asset classes given our strong financial position we were able to commit our balance sheet on behalf of clients and support strong volumes across our global markets franchise as investors sought to reduce risk exposure the very high levels of activities of activity demonstrate the strength and scope of our franchise and our ability to serve clients as an important risk intermediary looking forward our economists expect a very significant nearterm decline in growth followed by a rebound in the second half of the year when they expect us to get back about of the decline in output that we lose in the first two quarters more specifically annualized us gdp is forecasted to decline in excess in the second quarter before recovering in the third and fourth quarters resulting in an economic contraction of about of the year this compares to growth expectations of over just a few months ago there is obviously a wide range of uncertainty around forward projections given the unknown duration of the health crisis the reality is that none of us know for sure this is why it is critically important during this difficult period that we maintain a strong financial profile and remain agile and flexible in our service to our clients lastly ill share a few comments on our investor day commitments while january seems distant under these circumstances more distant under these circumstances than the or so weeks that have passed the strategic direction we laid out for the firm remains no less compelling strengthening our core businesses expanding in new and adjacent businesses and operating with greater efficiency remain ever important to the firm we established targets that contemplated a normal operating environment and clearly this is not a normal operating environment yet our targets represent medium and longterm goals which we still aspire to interestingly this environment has created opportunities for us to accelerate our strategic plans in certain areas our transaction banking rollout remains on track and our growth in corporate deposits has exceeded expectations in our alternatives business we have accelerated fundraising on a strategic solutions fund of meaningful size to help clients take advantage of attractive investment opportunities in our high net worth business we completed our rebranding of united capital to goldman sachs personal financial management on schedule in march and our strong growth in consumer deposits continues to underscore the strategic importance of that business you should expect us to manage through the current environment dynamically with our priorities of serving clients and protecting the longterm value of our franchise we will adjust our tactical response as appropriate which may impact the timing cadence or the size of certain investments that said our strategic goals remain in place as we execute we look forward on updating you to updating you on our progress with that i will turn it over to stephen the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 stephen m scherr chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david good morning to you all let me begin with our summary results on page during the first quarter three of our four business segments produced revenue growth in excess of versus the yearago period reflecting the strength of our franchise and the elevated level of activity in march these results were offset by losses in our asset management business due to the significant decline in the fair value of our longterm investments in equity debt securities and loans we also took a material provision for credit losses in the quarter despite the difficult backdrop our overall revenue levels remained relatively flat versus a year ago reflecting the diversification of our businesses before turning specifically to our results i want to reflect for a moment on the financial strength of the firm and the us banking system coming into this period of volatility in terms of capital liquidity and risk i also want to provide insight into where goldman sachs stands on those metrics as we enter the second quarter the industry came into this market dislocation with a robust financial position as the capital levels for large banks more than doubled over the past decade to approximately trillion our capital stands above our minimums with a reduction in our cet1 ratio during the quarter a reflection of a very purposeful deployment of balance sheet on behalf of clients as david noted our liquidity is very strong averaging over billion during the quarter and remains at a level higher than that now our risk positions remain balanced controlled and adequately provisioned for both in terms of counterparty risk and sector exposure our ability to serve as a principal intermediary of risk a source of liquidity and a provider of balance sheet on behalf of clients is rooted in the sound financial footing of the firm and our long history of being a firm that clients turn to in challenging moments across goldman sachs our forward planning and risk management practices enabled us to be well prepared the liquidity and capital buffers we hold are intended for times like these and we prudently deployed our financial resources to serve our clients during the first quarter as a function of the regular stress testing that we and the industry have undertaken over the past decade our liquidity and capital metrics are sized to withstand severely adverse scenarios during a time of increased market volatility and disruption our ability to seamlessly serve our clients while the vast majority of our employees work remotely demonstrates the dedication of our people the strength of our engineering and our business resiliency in addition to the financial standing of the organization in short goldman sachs is open for business lets turn to our business performance on page beginning with investment banking investment banking produced first quarter net revenues of billion up versus the fourth quarter and up versus yearago quarter first quarter financial advisory revenues of million were down sequentially and down versus last year amid fewer deal closings consistent with lower industry volumes during the quarter we participated in nearly billion of announced transactions and closed deals for nearly billion of deal volume we maintained our number one position in both announced and completed ma league table rankings we continued to engage with clients about significant changes in the economic environment and the implications for the ma business given the new set of challenges facing a variety of industries we expect client demand to evolve as they seek our assistance bolstering balance sheets hedging market and financial risks and capturing strategic opportunities while there are clearly some industries that are more directly impacted than others dialogues with clients are at elevated levels across all verticals as this crisis impacts clients of all types and in all regions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 moving to underwriting equity underwriting net revenues of million were flat versus the fourth quarter and up versus a slow period for ipos in the first quarter of last year for the quarter we ranked number two globally in equity underwriting with billion in volume across transactions as we executed a number of key ipos during the first two months of the quarter additionally following the market pullback we helped a number of clients raise capital in the convertible market through public and private transactions notably we led a number of highprofile pipe issuances for a variety of companies including wayfair and twitter turning to debt underwriting net revenues were million down versus the fourth quarter and up from a year ago activity this quarter reflected growth in assetbacked and leveraged finance activity our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our number four global debt underwriting league table ranking and our ability to provide clients access to the investmentgrade and belowinvestmentgrade markets even through the challenging environment in march as david mentioned in the last two full weeks of march we saw record us dollar investmentgrade issuance with over billion of activity of that goldman sachs helped raise nearly billion of financing for clients capturing over share roughly double versus last year evidencing our client engagement and commitment to market access helping clients access public market financing windows also enabled us to better risk manage our portfolio of acquisition finance commitments as certain bridge and other facilities were taken out in permanent financings in the capital markets our investment banking backlog decreased versus the fourth quarter but rose versus a year ago given the environment we expect announcement timelines on several larger transactions in our backlog to be delayed that said we maintain active dialogues with clients across our global franchise and know that market conditions can evolve quickly revenues from corporate lending were million nearly double the fourth quarter and up over threefold versus a year ago driven by approximately million of hedge gains relating to our relationship lending book on wider credit spreads during the quarter we maintain singlename hedges on certain larger commitments as a prudent riskmanagement tool the hedge gains could of course reverse in future quarters should credit spreads tighten as a reminder corporate lending includes middlemarket lending relationship lending and acquisition financing in the quarter gains on singlename and index hedges as well as net interest income on the portfolio more than offset fair value marks on our acquisition financing commitments during the quarter we saw approximately billion corporate commitment drawdowns in relationship lending as we supported our clients liquidity needs during this difficult time while we saw a higher percentage of drawdowns from our noninvestmentgrade clients given the larger size of our investmentgrade book the billion was roughly evenly split on a notional basis between investmentgrade and noninvestmentgrade these draws were within our expectations for a stress scenario and were below the amount prefunded in our liquidity pool during this period we also saw significant inflows in commercial deposit accounts tied to our new transaction banking platform these deposit balances total billion and were now serving over clients reflecting the early diversification benefits of our new business growth strategy moving to global markets on page net revenues were billion in the first quarter up sequentially and up versus last year growth was driven by significantly higher client activity amid wider bidask spreads and solid risk management in a challenging market as we noted at our investor day our results in global markets like all segments include fullyallocated costs as such our reported quarterly results in global markets were the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 burdened by a charge of approximately million related to valuation adjustments on derivatives associated with widening of credit and funding spreads ficc net revenues were billion up sequentially and up yearoveryear growth versus last year was driven by an increase in financing and growth in intermediation revenues within ficc intermediation we saw elevated client flows across all of our businesses with four out of five business lines posting higher first quarter net revenues versus last year again reflecting the value of our standing commitment to a diversified ficc franchise in currencies we saw a very active quarter with meaningful revenue improvement as higher volatility drove significantly higher client volume and strong performance in the americas and asia we continued to onboard new clients to our marquee and efx platforms during the quarter and produced record results in this business reflecting our significant investments in recent years changing client workflows and our willingness to provide liquidity during market stress our rates franchise also performed well given high levels of client intermediation and despite the challenge of managing risk positions through a significant jump in volatility as several banks around the world cut rates and the fed and ecb launched significant quantitative easing programs in commodities our business delivered strong results in oil as we worked with our clients to manage extraordinary price volatility we also generated solid performance in metals these positive results were partly offset by cva from wider counterparty credit spreads in credit our performance was solid across our global franchise we benefited from significantly higher client activity in more liquid index ph cds products and notably in client portfolio trades which more than offset the impact of wider credit spreads amid lower liquidity in cash product trading inventory like in our currencies business our technology platforms in credit enabled us to serve clients in period of market dislocation with both buyers and sellers benefiting from our global franchise capital commitment and the efficiency of our digital platforms in mortgages net revenues fell as significantly higher client activity was offset by wider spreads impacting our inventory particularly in agencies as we saw deleveraging across the market importantly our performance was cushioned by the capital and riskreduction measures we executed over the past several years lastly in ficc financing we saw considerable strength in our repo business as we helped clients navigate dislocated funding markets which have begun to normalize in recent weeks turning to equities on page net revenues for the first quarter were billion up versus the fourth quarter and up versus a year ago equities intermediation net revenues of billion rose versus a year ago aided by derivatives given higher equity market volatility and significantly higher client volumes this was partially offset by a more difficult marketmaking backdrop in europe given unexpected dividend cuts equities financing revenues of million rose yearoveryear driven by higher average quarterly prime client balances moving to asset management on page collectively our asset management activities produced negative net revenues of million in the first quarter first quarter management and other fees totaled million up versus yearago driven by higher client assets under supervision the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 incentive fees increased to million driven primarily by asset harvesting including closing a key special purpose acquisition company or spac transaction growth in management and incentive fees was more than offset by marks our onbalance sheet investment portfolio losses here reflect the sharp market declines during the quarter given the majority of our assets in this segment are accounted for at fair value our equity investments produced million of net losses in the first quarter as material gains generated on the pending or closed sale of certain investments in january and february were more than offset by broader markdowns on our public and private equity holdings in march more specifically on our billion private equity portfolio we generated gains of approximately million from eventdriven items including agreements to sell our investment in a uk student housing portfolio and our investment in airtrunk a data center in australia gains from dispositions were offset by approximately million of marks on our private equity positions reflecting the underlying operating performance of the businesses and roughly million of marks on our billion public equity portfolio including a million loss on avantor and significantly smaller losses across the broader portfolio net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were a negative million attributable to marktomarket closes on debt securities and fair value loans as shown on page this segment houses a billion credit portfolio including billion of fair value debt securities and billion of corporate and real estate loans of which billion are held at fair value this portfolio includes a range of investing activities executed by our private credit group and multistrategy investing teams which have historically generated solid contributions to firm performance over many years that said in the first quarter the fair market value component of the portfolio managed by these teams incurred significant credit spread widening which more than offset the ongoing net interest income from the portfolio itself this drove significant losses across the portfolio of senior and mezzanine corporate loans and our broader portfolio of liquid corporate debt securities as we go forward we will continue to risk manage the credit portfolio prudently with respect to loans while the majority of the portfolio is noninvestmentgrade by design it is wellstructured and over is secured we also would note that if spreads retrace as they have in the first part of the second quarter we could recoup a portion of the first quarters losses but of course there is no assurance of that outcome turning to consumer wealth management on page we produced billion of revenues in the first quarter up versus the fourth quarter and up versus yearago driven by higher average assets under supervision increased transaction volumes and incentive fees and higher consumer banking revenues from deposits and lending products for the quarter wealth management and other fees of million rose versus last year reflecting both organic growth and the united capital acquisition assets under supervision rose versus the prior year to billion we also saw higher incentive fees while private banking and lending revenues declined consumer banking revenues were million in the first quarter rising nearly versus last year reflecting higher net interest income from strong growth in deposits and credit card loan balances consumer deposits at quarterend totaled billion across the us and uk reflecting a record billion of quarterly growth in the consumer platform performance in march was solid with billion of monthly growth providing a valuable source of funding to the firm the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 funded consumer loan balances remain stable at billion of which billion were from marcus consumer loans and billion from credit card going forward we expect to see a more modest level of growth in both marcus unsecured loans and apple card as we seek to manage our risk profile and reduce the pace of origination during this period of market and economic dislocation now lets turn the page for our firmwide assets under supervision total client assets for which we earn a management fee including those in asset management and consumer wealth management totaled trillion in the first quarter down billion versus the fourth quarter but up billion versus a year ago our sequential decline was driven by billion of market depreciation offset by billion of liquidity and billion of longterm inflows switching gears on page lets address net interest income and our lending portfolio total firmwide net interest income was billion for the first quarter up sequentially reflected in global markets and consumer given the impact of lower funding costs and continued deposit growth next lets review loan growth and credit performance our total loan portfolio at quarterend was billion up billion sequentially driven primarily by funded commercial revolvers in investment banking as i noted earlier our provision for credit losses in the first quarter was million up million versus last quarter during the quarter we recognized firmwide net chargeoffs of million resulting in a net chargeoff ratio of on the wholesale portfolio we took impairments and bolstered our reserves particularly for loans in the oil and gas sector given recent price declines in our consumer portfolio provisions related to marcus were higher versus last quarter due primarily to cecl reserve rates even though realized net chargeoffs declined additionally we note our provisions during the quarter were impacted by higher levels of reserving for new loan growth under cecl which we adopted as planned at quarterend our allowance for credit losses stood at billion our allowance for funded loans under accrual accounting was overall our credit performance remains in line with our expectations given the recent economic deterioration that said we continue to monitor the portfolio and broader risk factors closely and well take any and all mitigating actions as appropriate one area of particular focus is our lending and counterparty exposure to the oil and gas sector at the end of march we had approximately billion of total lending and counterparty exposure to the oil and gas sector net of roughly million of hedges approximately billion were funded loans our total exposure is diversified with no single counterparty over million before hedges just over half is noninvestmentgrade of which over is secured and as a proportion of our overall wholesale credit book our oil and gas exposure remains very manageable now lets turn to expenses on page our total quarterly operating expenses of billion increased versus last year driven by significantly higher brokerage clearing and exchange fees attributable to higher client activity higher provisions for litigation and an increase in expenses related to real estate consolidated investments including impairments given the challenging operating environment we are closely reexamining all of our forward spending and investment plans to ensure the best use of our resources consistent with our historical focus on expense discipline and the emphasis on cost control at investor day we will assess the timing magnitude and pace of certain expenses and investments importantly we continue to pursue our mediumterm efficiency target to that the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 end we expect to realize the effect of planned reductions in noncompensation expenses more significantly through the back half of the year finally on taxes our reported tax rate was for the first quarter our lower rate reflected the impact of share based compensation awards and the lower impact or and the impact of lower pretax earnings on permanent benefits as noted previously we expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately turning to select balance sheet data on slide let me begin with capital our common equity tier ratio was at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach down basis points sequentially driven by balance sheet and rwa growth in light of our meaningful client engagement during the quarter our ratio under the advanced approach decreased by basis points to with the incremental decline versus standardized due to higher credit spread volatility our slr was down basis points sequentially also on balance sheet deployment to clients this quarter we returned a total of billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases notably at the beginning of the quarter and common stock dividends our basic share count ended the quarter at another record low of million shares as you will recall goldman sachs and members of the financial services forum voluntarily decided to temporarily suspend buybacks through the second quarter of this pause allows us to continue to deploy our resources to support our clients in the context of the current operating environment we remain committed to allocating capital to accretive highreturn opportunities and when not deployed returning excess to shareholders as it relates to our dividend given our continued earnings generation and solid capital position we feel comfortable maintaining our dividend further to the balance sheet total assets ended the quarter at trillion up versus last quarter we maintain strong liquidity levels as referenced earlier our global core liquid assets averaged a record billion up billion versus the fourth quarter on the liabilities side our total deposits increased to billion up billion versus last quarter with strong flows through our marcus and transaction banking channels as we continue to execute on our longterm strategy to remix our liabilities toward deposits our total unsecured longterm borrowings were billion driven by billion of vanilla debt issuance during the quarter as we accelerated issuance into the first quarter from what was intended for the back part of this year to better position ourselves to be in the service of our clients in conclusion our first quarter results reflected the volatile operating environment and our ability to navigate turbulent markets and support our client franchise as we look toward the balance of the year we take strength from our robust financial position including capital and liquidity our client franchise remains strong and with the ongoing dedication of the talented professionals of goldman sachs we will marshal the full resources of the firm to serve our clients during this unprecedented time with that thank you again for dialing in and well now open the line for questions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions and your first question is from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much appreciate it i guess the tough one on the getting you to talk about the linearity of reserves if possible meaning you laid out the macro backdrop that youve taken reserves under if we roll forward a quarter the worlds a little worse or just delayed could you talk about how reserves shift as we shift out a quarter meaning if you if we start thinking that the economic recovery is more like a event instead of second half event could you talk about the million of provision taken relative to how that changes with the pushing out of a recovery i know thats a hard move stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure glenn thank you so as you note the provision for credit loss we took was million about million of that were in provisions and about million of that related to the relationship loan book with the balance really guided by the crisis relating to covid and growth in the overall portfolio in answering your question ill point out what we did in this quarter because i think itll reflect a process that well continue to look at which is we weigh a variety of macroeconomic scenarios one thats optimistic a base case and one thats downside in a quarter in which we sat and if circumstances played we heavily weighted a downside scenario that doesnt rely exclusively on our own economists but takes a broad look and obviously we dont know what the forward holds in the quarter and so i think we will hone to the very same process we did which is looking at a variety of scenarios putting enough weight on a downside or a base case or for that matter one thats marginally more optimistic its worth pointing out that in these scenarios we take a look at what the contraction of gdp is we look at unemployment but we dont ignore the fact that there are a number of programs in place across a range of countries notably the us where central banks and treasuries have put in place monetary and fiscal stimulus that has the potential to serve as some counter balance if you will to what may play to the extent that holds and that accelerates a recovery i have every expectation that reserves would reflect it if this continued on and that didnt have the efficacy that is otherwise intended one could imagine a scenario that plays more to the downside and i would expect provisions and losses to reflect the same and so again hard to predict what the next quarter or subsequent quarters hold but i think well rely and you should know that well rely on a pretty robust modeling exercise that will reflect the circumstances that we see in front of us glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay i appreciate that maybe one followup on the investment portfolios within asset management and appreciate the detail you gave maybe you could help one on a part a and part b one on equity one on debt on the equity side the publics are the publics and were down about in line with what the markets were the the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 private side is only a few percent so if you could talk to whats differentiated about the portfolio and the cash flow and the composition and the diversity of it and why it would warrant a lesser mark and a different question on the debt side debt and lending side the marks were pretty robust there given the spread widening just curious if all of that was marktomarket and nothing sold because spreads have obviously improved so far in april thank you stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc no not a problem so let me give you kind of a quick decomposition and ill start with equity so we have a billion equity portfolio billion of that is in private billion of that is in the public space when you look at the pl around it i would say that on the positive side we realized about million of gain principally generated around the harvesting of assets one is i mentioned being the uk housing platform and the other being the airtrunk asset in australia so that generated positive revenues of million also embedded in this was a million revenue pickup in the context of cies that we keep independent of the equity portfolio so think of that portfolio generating positive billion or so that was offset by both public and private marks so in the public realm we took down about million of loss most notable within that was million of avantor on the million of losses in the balance of the private portfolio that was spread across about names and so its important just to understand that dispersion i would also say that when you look at the private portfolio you dont hone exclusively to kind of public market comparables you look at the underlying performance of those businesses and just to give you a little bit of insight into that of that private portfolio i would say of it continued to perform well in the context of operating performance in the business about of that portfolio was impacted by covid and was the source of a considerable number of the private marks taken and then of that portfolio was what spawned positive gains in the harvesting that was there just to give you a breakdown and the reliance on underlying performance andor events and not the exclusive reliance on a public sort of analogue in terms of looking at that private portfolio let me turn now to answer your question on the debt side so there its a billion portfolio about billion of that is fair value so debt securities about billion loans about billion the balance of billion are loans on an accrual basis and so as you can imagine the marktomarket on the fair value was largely influenced by dramatic spread widening that was experienced in the quarter we saw highyield spreads in the us gap out by about basis points the same in europe gapped out by about basis points now as i noted we have seen some retrenchment of that in the beginning part of the second quarter that doesnt do anybody any good as it related to marks taken in the first quarter but just to give you a sense of the markets retrenchment as we began early now well see what the rest of the quarter holds but that just gives you a sense of balance in the context of both the equity and the credit portfolio operator our next question is from the line of christian bolu with autonomous please go ahead sir christian bolu q analyst autonomous research good morning david and stephen maybe first on the sustainability of ficc strength i think your sequential quarter performance of up is probably the best of all banks that have reported so far so are you finally seeing payoffs from your growth initiatives and seeing actual share gains in this business and then just given the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 the strength of performance and more importantly the countercyclical nature of the business does it change how you think about allocating capital to ficc over time david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc hi sure thanks christian ill start and stephen might jump in weve been there are two parts to your question in my mind the first is we have been very committed this management team over the last months to running a diversified fixed income business at a point in time where the ability to differentiate in the intermediation part of that business was harder we were in a very lowvolatility environment for a long period of time youve seen us stay committed to a diverse business whereas in some years some businesses do well some businesses do poorly but we really as weve reoriented the client focus of the organization we believe that a full service platform would through cycles pay off for us weve spent a lot of time really thinking about the way we connect with clients and the way were servicing clients and trying to make that business over the last year less transactionoriented and more clientoriented those investments based on the feedback we have and data we have having nothing to do with covid have borne progress over the course of the last year from a market share perspective both on an objective basis and also from the subjective feedback were getting from our clients in this quarter you saw all people that operate the intermediation businesses benefit from higher volatility and more client activity im watching all the reporting of the other banks as you are we think we benefited meaningfully from that because of the way weve invested in that business and were wellpositioned how it continues going forward will depend on the environment and what the environment brings in an environment that continues to have more elevated volatility and more changes in risk patterns for our clients i think our franchise will continue to benefit in terms of capital allocation i think weve got the right amount of capital in that business but look you saw the operating leverage in that business when you look at the returns in that business based on how were operating now so again weve always thought about through the cycle i think our team performed very very well in this business im glad weve stayed in the broad array of businesses given the environment that were now in but youll only be able to judge whether weve got the capital right and we stay zealously focused on this as we continue to run through the cycle so we have no plans to change the capital allocation at the moment other than to try to accommodate clients we grew riskweighted assets in the business which obviously attracts capital well continue to do that if its attractive and it supports our clients stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc i mean christian good morning couple of things i would add to davids answer first to his point on capital allocation its bearing note as we report now in ways we hadnt before that ficc produced an roe of and the reflection of the nimbleness and agility of capital which was a topic discussed at our investor day is the ability to deploy capital where its required and needed by our clients and thats the way balance sheet flows in and around the firm and within the firm in terms of capital allocation id also point out that i think this business benefited and you heard us talk about this over the preceding one or two earnings calls where we took risk down generally speaking within this business and so as a consequence we came into this crisis with a more manageable risk profile and were able to manage flows and be in the service of intermediating clients more thoroughly i should point out as i may have misspoken but growth the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 markets produced an roe as a segment of but obviously ficc a big contributor to it in the context of our overall performance david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc the only other thing christian id add is that weve also been making significant investments in technology platforms to better serve our clients in this business and we saw a real benefit especially with everybody working remote on our technology connectivity and our platforms and we think thats an investment that has paid off christian bolu q analyst autonomous research great great thank you for the color maybe switching to the loan book i think the loan book has more than doubled over the last three years and has been a real source of revenue growth for the firm im just looking forward how are you thinking about loan growth both in terms of customer demand and your risk appetite to lend into a global recession stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so christian ill take that question look the abiding proposition for us obviously is to maintain appropriate risk management and equally be mindful of capital and liquidity and so taking those three as kind of the abiding governors i have every expectation that the firm will continue both aggressively and offensively to extend credit in the interest of clients across a range of our businesses and equally to meet client needs in the context of corporate drawdowns or other liquidity needs of the client itself the book obviously stands at billion there was meaningful growth in the quarter occasioned by the relationship loan book being drawn by about billion but i think risk is obviously an important governor and so i would just point out as an example in the context of the consumer book were ever committed to that business but at this moment in this environment we will be quite cautious in terms of credit extension and growing that book and well return to grow that book once this sort of circumstance and market volatility passes just as an example of how risk needs to be the governor in the context of managing this profile and the loan book overall operator your next question is from the line of michael carrier with bank of america please go ahead michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning and thanks for taking the question first question just a followup on the asset management business and thanks for all the color so far on the private equity portfolio versus the public equity portfolio historically how much of the valuations tend to be fairly close to the public markets versus what could we expect on a lag basis if the challenging backdrop ph ends up continuing stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so the philosophy that we brought and the accounting rigor we brought to marking our private portfolio frankly has not at all changed this quarter relative to what it has been historically meaning we always look at events that play out as a reference point against which names or companies in which theres been an event either a sale or another investment into that name we mark it in that context the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 where there isnt an event we look at the underlying performance in the business in just the way i described we did it this way and so the underlying performance of those businesses is ph guiding the true north in the way in which we look to mark that portfolio now as we look forward to the extent that we come into a quarter or multiple quarters which ultimately weigh on the underlying performance and the underlying profitability of that portfolio company or set of companies there obviously then could be further marks and loss occasioned by that and that would therefore be a lag but i just want to lay out the methodology we use in the context of how we mark it and equally point out that this quarter is no different than any other in the way in which we mark that book michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay that makes sense and helpful stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and just as a followup results in trading and banking held up well and i realize its impossible to predict or to have too much clarity but could you help us out or provide some context or color on where youre continuing to see elevated activity versus the areas where we could expect some normalization or falloff just given some of the pocket that weve seen over the past couple of months david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure sure michael i mean ill take a stab at talking a little bit about that first in the investment banking business the advisory business is always a lag so we have a backlog of ma deals that were struck earlier many of them will continue to close that will bring some revenue into the second quarter but as we go longer and we continue to be in an environment where theres very very low confidence obviously as youve witnessed over the last few weeks theres been very little new ma activity thats been initiated during a time of low confidence i would expect that to continue so over time the velocity of revenue accrual on the ma side will slow until we get to a period of higher confidence with respect to the financing side of the investment banking business youve obviously seen in the last few weeks record levels of investmentgrade issuance one record week after another and so debt financing has been very strong youve seen some equity issuance and certainly with more stability in equity markets the companies are trying to bolster their balance sheets bolster their liquidity and position themselves to ride out what may be a longer period of economic contraction that actually should accrue to our benefit in that business because i think were well positioned to capture our fair share of providing that liquidity and financing support in the trading businesses in the early part of the quarter weve seen heightened levels of activity in the early part of the quarter theres no guarantee obviously that continues as we go through the quarter but in the early part of the quarter weve seen our investing clients continue to be very very active i think were going through a period we were going through ph in march a period of significant derisking weve now been going the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 through a period of repositioning so our clients have been active as you point out its very hard to say what thats going to look like two three months from now but thats the view id give you at the moment operator your next question is from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start off with a question on funding one of the biggest drivers of the rotce build you laid out at investor day was the billion benefit from funding optimization and we tracked the deposit cost pretty closely weve seen a lot of your competitors aggressively match the fed rate cuts but you maintained very competitive deposit payouts certainly helped contribute to strong deposit growth this quarter i was just hoping if you could update us on how your deposit strategy is evolving in the low rate environment and whether the flat yield curve and still elevated deposit payouts could impact that billion fund benefit you cited at investor day stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thank you steve so let me start with so the strategy around rate we took our rate down actually yesterday in the us relative to where it had been our strategy remains unchanged in that regard which is we name to be certainly not the toprate payer but somewhere in the three or four category and well continue to do that with an eye toward building out greater product attributes and a more formidable relationship with depositors such that we rely less on rate in the context of both drawing and maintaining deposits but its against that strategy that we saw at least for us record inflows on the deposit side in terms of the mediumterm target which we set out in investor day of achieving billion of savings occasioned by the migration of our funding mix thats no less an imperative for us now than it was then and id simply point out that the market will pull some volatility into that measurement though again this is a medium term target that we will achieve we will move closer and closer to of our funding in deposits the amount or the delta of savings if you will will be both a function of where we take deposit rates inasmuch as where wholesale funding obviously takes itself and i think particularly in this market and most notably in march this was a really good very stable source of funding for us but i think the forward trajectory both as a strategy and then equally as it relates to our ability to harvest the kind of savings that we talked about over the mediumterm is one that we are going to continue to adhere to and watch and achieve the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that and stephen just for my followup relating to expense management i wanted to unpack some of your comments a bit more you talked about savings initiatives helping reduce noncomps in the back half of this year but just in terms of a nearterm outlook are you still comfortable with maintaining i believe the guidance was calling for flat noncomps exlitigation in and just given some of the recent disruption from covid whether that has informed or changed your strategy around executing on the longterm savings target of billion stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so theres no change relating to our mediumterm term target of achieving billion now the early pace of that during this period pandemic will obviously be slower but this is a mediumterm or threeyear target and i think we will come out of this experience with an even clearer view as to where changes can be made and where we can harvest expense reduction in the near term im very much minded to achieve flat noncomp expense relative to where we were but let me just be open and point to the variables one is obviously bce this is a variable expense that obviously plays in the context of market activity weve seen more of it and so as a consequence weve seen more expense in that regard on consolidated investments it would have been my preference in a calmer market for us to have exited more of those consolidated investments and shed ourselves of some of those expenses whether the market permits that to happen over the balance of the year well have to see obviously honing to flat noncomp was exlitigation so im just leaving that aside but the two variables really just to be candid about it are bce relative to volumes and cies to the extent we can harvest it otherwise were quite focused on trying to sort of live to a flat noncomp expense yearoveryear operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i just wanted to test your conviction on how much of a counter balance the economy should have for the monetary and fiscal actions and your conviction seems to be important because it goes to your provisioning level which you said you had considered as part of that provision and the pace of additional financing for your clients and frankly for the advice that you give to your clients i mean you are the biggest advisor to corporations out there i mean what are you telling them as far as how they should proceed david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so thanks mike ill start stephen might join in but youre asking a multilayered question so on the first part of the question theres no question that the response the fiscal and monetary response is going to have a stimulative effect theres no question when we come out of this and im not making a prediction of when well come out of it but when we come out of it it will have a stimulative effect versus a scenario where it didnt exist the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 the question thats so hard to answer and in my conversations with clients im having it constantly we have to rebuild confidence in peoples security and safety around the virus we can all have economic forecasts and we can all talk about the economic consequence of this but unless people feel safe and secured and confident around the virus the economic impact will continue in some way shape or form that is a very very hard thing to predict so ive tried to encourage companies that weve talked to and individuals for that matter to hope for the better but plan for the worst and so certainly i think if youre trying to prepare for an economic environment you have to view something that is a slower economic recovery as you come out of this and look even if you look at the goldman sachs scenario of a very steep decline with a sharp increase in the second and third quarter theyre still only predicting a recovery of the output that was lost so i think for anybody operating a business you have to be planning on an assumption that were going to be operating in a recession through into and you have to and plan accordingly will the monetary policy and fiscal policy be a benefit to the positive of what that trajectory looks like in the third fourth quarter and into the first half of next year yes but its very hard to quantify what that will be because the uncertainty around the course that the virus will take and how it will affect human behavior is still very uncertain and anyone whos telling you theyre sure that itll look like this or theyre sure that itll look like that i dont think anybodys sure and so i think this will be a gradual path and as we have more information well be able to better evaluate what were trying to do is ensure that in our organization were risk managing and provisioning appropriately as we can based on the information we can looking forward with that kind of a mindset mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well and well the other part of the question is given that how aggressively are you pursuing financing is this a time to gain share by stepping in when others might not david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc look we are actively we are focused on helping our clients across the organization if you looked at investment grade just taking investmentgrade which has been very very obvious and transparent we picked up significant share over the course of the last four weeks and so we think were wellpositioned to capture share were going to do it with prudence and a longterm view of our client franchise and so we are longterm investors on our client franchise we always have been there isnt an institution that does not have to make certain choices around how it allocates its capital at a time like this we think were good at that we think were nimble but of course were going to lean into our client relationships and take a longterm view stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc mike i also would say that as a byproduct of advice if you look at the roster of corporations that have issued into both the investmentgrade and belowinvestmentgrade market what youll find are companies that are in certain industries that have been meaningfully impacted by the virus yet saw the utility of taking access in the market so that they can better weather the storm and the uncertainty thats in the market itself the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 you also saw issuers who are not impacted to the same extent but they too saw the utility of tapping the market and looking to take themselves to the other side of this moment of volatility and sort of comport themselves and carry their business that way and i think thats a reflection of advice that we and certainly others have been giving to issuing clients operator your next question is from the line of kian abouhossein with jpmorgan please go ahead kian abouhossein q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thanks for taking my question the first question is related to your comments on your global markets equities you mentioned the dislocation on dividends and i was wondering if you could give quantify the impact that it had on your results and in that context on equities also we clearly hear that a lot of investment banks have been having gamma positions in that context i was hoping if its material if you could indicate if that was a positive or negative impact on your results as well stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so what we experienced in equities over the quarter was the negative consequence of the suspension by certain companies of dividends mostly in europe and so it had a european tilt to it rather relative to other geographies i wouldnt call this out as being material im not in a position to call out the precision of its impact but i would say that there were certain industries that were subject to kind of an outright suspension of dividends there were others in the context of the circumstances of the virus that werent able to convene agms and as a consequence could not declare dividend obviously we facilitate client flows that trade in dividends its a bigger business in europe than elsewhere and the consequence of those suspensions was a negative impact to overall revenue in that business but nothing that i would call out as being material kian abouhossein q analyst jpmorgan securities plc and in respect to looking at the trends through the quarter because clearly we are trying to understand a little bit how is the sales and trading franchise impacted and you clearly mentioned at the beginning that the first half was excellent the second half was dislocated but clearly the trading revenues and volumes when you look at the volumes were holding up extremely well and generally in a downturn what we see is a dryup of volumes which we havent really seen so just from your experience how should we think first of all about the trend line that we saw through the quarter if you can comment on that both on fixed income sales and trade and equities and secondly how should we think about the trend generally for the industry when we compare to historic levels where we really see a dryup post a material dislocation or decline in markets stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc go ahead david david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc you can go ahead stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc no no i was just going to comment that i can speak to the trend that we saw in the quarter and david can offer some further comment of what were seeing in the beginning of the second to the extent that sustains itself but while david rightly pointed out that the quarter was on one hand january and february and then on the other hand march in march we saw very high volumes through our sales and trading businesses and took advantage of that at wider bidoffer spreads id also point out that and particularly using marquee and some of our electronic platforms we were engaging in very large portfolio trades on behalf of clients and i think those electronic platforms were busy and were useful particularly because its not just we who were at a workfromhome posture but equally clients were and so these digital platforms across geographies proved to be quite useful and it proved to be a positive consequence to the overall pl and certainly to the business of sales and trading to the extent that continues to play forward one could assume youd see the very same phenomenon but thats difficult obviously to project david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i dont have anything stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc really to add i think weve kind of covered this the first part of the quarter things were going well in the trading businesses but customer activity in the trading businesses accelerated in march and its continued to remain just in the first two weeks higher than what we would have seen as an average level of activity before the crisis operator your next question is from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 hi good morning thanks for taking the question im sorry i wanted to circle back on the provision assumptions i know youve spoken about it a couple times but its just still a little confusing to me because youve referenced sort of what the goldman sachs economists think but it seemed as though you suggested thats not what was necessarily an input into your own provision assumptions and then i think david you referenced a recession when advising clients that a recession might go into and but im not sure whether or not that was the advice to clients or that was the input into provisioning and i think stephen you referenced three scenarios could you maybe give a little bit more clarity on what those assumptions are and given that you have both debt securities and loans when we look at the debt securities should we like add in the mark you took which looks like about a mark on the billion that you laid out as almost like a quasiprovision in how we think about it holistically thank you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc okay so brennan im going to start and ill pass to stephen to talk about the provision stuff but first we are mixing certain things i was asked a question about advice to clients and im going to be a little bit more specific in my words we all understand that a recession is two quarters in a row of economic decline okay and if you looked at the goldman sachs scenario that would say thered be a recession from the first and second quarter but we would then have economic growth in the third and fourth quarter there wouldnt technically be a recession however if youre advising clients and you took the goldman sachs economic model that says that you only recover of the output that you lost in the decline in output during the first and second quarter and so if youre giving someone advice about how to position their business even though technically we wouldnt be in a recession as you got to the end of the year and early we would not have recovered the output that had declined and so certainly if youre operating a lot of these businesses its still going to feel like youre operating in a recession and so the advice to clients is to think about when you get your business back to where it was and that obviously takes a longer time thats client advice that has nothing to do at all with how we model or think about our provisioning and ill let stephen go talk about that a little bit more stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so brennan let me just let me directly address your question on kind of process and what we go through so we obviously have an independent risk group that assigns and works with controllers to an economic scenario that serves as a backdrop that influences the direction they take as they look name by name through both the equity and the credit portfolio and so it is an input it is not a formula if you will that sort of bleeds out a percentage thats applied to the whole each name is reviewed in the portfolio its done by an independent risk group and that independent risk group uses as an input a macroeconomic backdrop that they assemble theres no question that the goldman sachs research group is an input to that but what jan hatzius puts out is not the sole determination the independent risk group goes about establishing their perspective their backdrop with that as an input but not exclusive and so that gives rise obviously to an environment against which our controllers approach every position in the book and ascribe an appropriate mark or a reserve against it and thats the process that we take the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 on the question you asked about the mark on our fair value debt and lending portfolio i would just draw a very big distinction between marks taken on that versus provisions obviously very different accounting regime depending upon the nature of the portfolio itself i would also be very reluctant to try to ascribe a single percentage to the entire book because the duration on that book is very different meaning it runs a gamut and so you need to be quite careful in the context of how you mark it and so id just offer you that detail just to be super clear about the process we run brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you for all that color and clarification stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc ph not a problem brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thats helpful quick my followup being i think in your guys in your discussion of the equities business you flagged growth in balances of equity financing but i believe stephen it was average balanced and so given what happened in the quarter this the number might have been skewed are you seeing sustained strength in that average balance on the pb side just given some of the degrossing we hear from some large hedge funds it seemed to run counter now you guys might be picking up share in that business so just hoping to understand how its proceeding here in thank you stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so your observation was the right one which is average balances were up end of period was lower and so just to avoid any confusion than that i would say that theres nothing when we look out over the client base in prime thats to be called out as any particular category of client was challenged any more than the other meaning i think all of them whether it was quant hedge funds and the like all kind of were performing without any particular issue to be called out as against one or the other i would say as a general observation that deleveraging among that client base was less significant than perhaps one might imagine from the outside looking in but again no particular issue and this is a business that remains strategically important to us as we continue to go forward operator your next question comes from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc thank you good morning david and stephen stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc morning devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc i guess first question here on just some of the puts and takes of the move in interest rates and obviously goldman is going to be less levered to interest rate movements than some of the large banks but just with the dramatic shift across the curve in the back half of the quarter just if you can maybe help us think about some of the implications of the move on the model going forward whether it be on funding or revenues and then any other second derivatives sounds like debt issuance might be one area that benefits but anything else we should be thinking about stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so as ive said in the past and i sense from your own question net interest income is roughly of the firms overall revenues and so its not near the driver that it is for some of the larger big commercial banks i think that if you look at where rate moves are and where interest rates have come it probably plays more favorably to us in the context of funding and i would point out that again apropos of the answer i gave to the question on deposits as we continue to shift our funding mix with greater proportionality given to retail deposits and a bigger broader consumer business that well build it will become less rate reliant rates will come down in that regard and so our expectation is that this will play favorably to us more from a funding point of view than anything else but it is not a big driver in the overall composition of firmwide revenue devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc sure appreciate that and then just one on the investment banking outlook obviously you heard the commentary on the backlog and debt issuance doesnt have the same lead time as ma or ipos for that matter im just curious if the expectation is that ma and equity issuance are going to track the economic recovery which obviously could be slower here or are you seeing signs of engagement with clients that could suggest maybe a more material snapback recovery as the economy opens back up david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so devin i would say a couple of things on that first the engagement level with clients is extremely high extremely high across the organization and this is a different kind of recession we were operating in an economy that was really operating quite well was functionally fine and we turned it off with a sudden demand shock and thats kind of unprecedented and its also unprecedented in that or its uncertain in exactly how it turns back on and what the path of that is and so i can see a lot of scenarios as theres a clear understanding of the trajectory of the virus and how the virus is going to affect kind of the reengagement economically of businesses across the economy that there will be an opportunity for more consolidation or some activity in a whole variety of industries that probably wouldnt have been anticipated had the economy just kept chugging along so im not going to predict that but id say the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 engagement is high and i could certainly see that if we got to a place where the virus seemed under control and confidence was building i think that level of engagement could potentially pick up quite quickly operator your next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning i had a question on the impairment coming back to that i think you guys told us that we really shouldnt look from a on the private equities side the direction of the public markets they dont necessarily reflect whats going on fundamentally with those private equity companies that you have an investment in can you share with us some metrics we can look to from the outside to take a look at how those marks may move going forward stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc well it would be hard to get i mean shy of handing you a sheet which had every company and every industry it would be hard to do that ill just come back to the commentary i made before which is on billion of private equity positions twothirds of that portfolio in the context of our look and evaluation of their operating performance continued to perform well now that doesnt necessarily lead to the conclusion that they will continue or that number doesnt come down but in the quarter they performed well about of them were directly impacted by the virus we saw it in the operations of that business and then the balance obviously has been harvested roughly producing the gains that we saw and so its the ebitda performance of individual portfolio companies that really lays on and guides the direction that price action is allocated to those names and so owe think that weve invested in companies that have the capability as the goingin investment thesis to sort of weather a variety of different economic environments and i think the portfolio is obviously intended to hold up that well that way but its not immune by any means from broader macroeconomic circumstances and the marks will reflect the sort of assessment of performance as we move through uncertain quarters operator your next question is from the line of jeremy sigee with exane bnp paribas please go ahead jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas good morning thank you you talked about your willingness to deploy more balance sheets when you see opportunities i just wondered if you could talk more about what your expectations are for total balance sheet assets expanding further in the next couple of quarters and also riskweighted assets so i wondered if you could talk about both aspects of that the volume trends that you expect to see in terms of overall assets but also the riskweighted inflation that we have seen and whether we need to be ready for more of that looking forward stephen m scherr a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc it was an excellent question i appreciate you asking it on one hand as david and i have said now many times on this call part of the purposeful inflation of balance sheet and by extension riskweighted assets was in the the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 15apr2020 utility of serving our clients and the history of this firm strategically has been for that to happen meaning balance sheet moves because client demand is there the counter to that is that from a prudent risk management perspective we set boundaries for ourselves as to sort of what the consequence and tolerable consequence of that should be on capital and so were obviously well north of where we would otherwise be invading buffers and so weve got flexibility in that regard and we equally need to be mindful of what the forward calendar may be with respect to ccar and scb on the forward but its in the context of that that we will be prudent in the expansion of balance sheet and riskweighted assets mindful of where we think its appropriate for us to be from a capital point of view again given the fluid and attending guideposts that the regulatory issues will have for us and so that push and pull continues but we feel quite comfortable with where we are and with our ability to continue to put balance sheet in deployment at the service of our clients stephen m scherr chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc okay since we there are no further questions id like to take a moment just to thank everybody for joining the call on behalf of our senior management team we look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming weeks and months we obviously wish you all well in the context of this environment if there are any additional questions that arise in the meantime please dont hesitate to reach out to
