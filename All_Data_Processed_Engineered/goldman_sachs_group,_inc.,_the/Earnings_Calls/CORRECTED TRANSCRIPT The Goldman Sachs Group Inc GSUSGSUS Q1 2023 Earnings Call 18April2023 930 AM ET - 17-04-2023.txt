executive officer david solomon and our chief financial officer denis coleman let me pass the call to david david michael solomon chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks carey and good morning everyone thank you for joining us in the first quarter we delivered solid performance in a challenging environment we produced net revenues of billion and generated earnings per share of and an roe of and an rote of the first quarter was certainly volatile particularly for the banking sector after a fairly benign operating environment at the start of the year in march we witnessed the collapse of two regional banks in the united states stress quickly spread to a number of institutions across the financial sector where we saw ratings downgrades and steep valuation declines in very short order these stresses were not limited to the us as we saw when regulators help arrange the combination of switzerlands two largest financial institutions its important to appreciate the size of the disruption some of the market moves during the period were staggering particularly in interest rates to give you a sense of the magnitude there have been just four days in the past years that have seen twoyear yields move by basis points or more intraday one was in september and three of them occurred in midmarch this year monday march was the biggest oneday move in us treasury twoyear yields in over years as we sit here today it appears that the worst of the volatility is behind us prompt action by regulators was vital in bolstering confidence and stabilizing market sentiment the events of the first quarter acted as another reallife stress test and they demonstrated the resilience of the countrys largest financial institutions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 the gsibs have been a source of strength for the financial system we joined a consortium with other large institutions in making a billion uninsured term deposit into first republic bank to send a strong vote of confidence and a commitment to the us banking sector as for goldman sachs a longstanding and deeply rooted risk management culture helped us navigate this unusual environment in our 154year history we have lived and managed through many periods of disruption and its our rigorous processes and planning for tailwind scenarios before the stress enable us to react quickly and effectively when they do occur while its impossible to predict the exact form a market stress will take and we wont always execute perfectly our risk management culture strong liquidity and robust capital position have allowed us to navigate a complex environment while also continuing to actively support our clients given this backdrop it was clear our clients needed help managing the risks and turn to us for our expertise and execution capabilities both ficc and equities had a strong quarter as we help clients with their intermediation and financing needs underwriting activity however remained extremely muted and below recent averages as capital markets were further delayed from reopening in a meaningful way given the market disruption all in global banking markets delivered industryleading returns of in line with our throughthecycle targets even while advisory and capital markets activity remained muted this franchise continues to show impressive resilience in a variety of market environments given our broad and diversified set of businesses management fees across asset wealth management grew sequentially but segment returns were in the mid single digits as our onbalance sheet investments remain susceptible to volatility in asset prices it is a strategic priority to continue to reduce these positions and while we have made progress there is still work to do in platform solutions we saw positive underlying trends this quarter with revenues greater than provisions and we remain focused on driving this business towards profitability we also continue to explore strategic alternatives within our consumer platform businesses in the first quarter we sold a portion of our marcus loan portfolio and transferred the remainder to held for sale while this activity is now reflected in our awm segment it is an example of our narrowing our focus in the consumer space denis will take you through the financial impact of that momentarily additionally we are now initiating the process to explore the sale of greensky we believe greensky is a good business and its performing well with first quarter originations and our core home improvement loans up over yearoveryear and a weighted fico on total originations of over given our current strategic priorities however we may not be the best longterm holder of this business we will update you on our progress if and when there are material developments as i close id like to say a few words about the forward outlook the recent events in the banking sector are lowering growth expectations and there is a higher risk of a credit contraction given the environment is limiting banks appetites to extend credit this is an acceleration of a trend and a situation we are watching closely businesses and consumers continue to adjust the higher interest rates while the forward trajectory is still unclear we continue to be cautious about the economic outlook and we are operating the firm such that we are well prepared in the event that the environment weakens further overall i feel very confident about the state of our client franchise and the longterm opportunity set for goldman sachs as the events of the past quarter have illustrated we are operating from a position of strength and we have the people in place around the world to continue serving the broad range of clients needs with excellence and while much has transpired since we held our investor day at the end of february we remain focused on our the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 strategy to strengthen our leading global banking markets franchise and grow our asset wealth management business and we are committed to delivering for clients and shareholders i will now turn it over to denis to cover our financial results for the quarter in more detail denis p coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david good morning lets start with our results on page of the presentation in the first quarter we generated net revenues of billion and net earnings of billion resulting in earnings per share of turning to performance by segment starting on page global banking markets produced revenues of billion in the first quarter which generated industryleading roe for the segment of advisory revenues of million were down amid lower industry completions underwriting revenues continue to be below recent averages and were lower yearoveryear despite the difficult backdrop we were number one in the league tables for completed ma and highyield debt underwriting we also ranked second for equity and equityrelated underwriting our backlog fell quarteronquarter primarily in advisory but we remain cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the second half of the year and particularly for strategic ma we also expect investors will need more certainty before financing markets reopen broadly but we have seen an increase in underwriting dialogues in the first two weeks of the second quarter ficc net revenues were billion in the quarter down as one of our strongest sets of results in rates was more than offset by significantly lower currencies and commodities revenues which were very strong in the first quarter of in ficc financing revenues rose slightly yearoveryear equities net revenues were billion in the quarter down yearonyear a decline in intermediation revenues was partially offset by record financing revenues of billion with the sequential increase driven by higher activity and increased balances coupled with improved customer spreads moving to asset wealth management on page revenues of billion rose yearoveryear given improved results in equity and debt investments and as management and other fees increased yearover year to a record billion though underlying trends in the business remained strong private banking and lending revenues of million fell yearoveryear driven by the partial sale of our marcus unsecured loan portfolio as well as a transfer of the remaining portfolio to held for sale in line with our strategic decision to narrow our consumer ambitions the associated revenue reduction of million was largely offset by a reserve release of million additionally we benefited from nii and incremental reserve releases associated with paydowns all in the marcus loan portfolio was profitable for the quarter net revenues for equity investments were million driven by million in revenues related to cies and million of gains related to our billion public portfolio partially offset by million of net losses on our billion private equity portfolio primarily within real estate this quarter we experienced approximately million of impairments on our cie portfolio which are reflected in operating expenses debt investments revenues were million driven by net interest income of million the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 moving on to page total firmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record trillion driven by billion of market appreciation as well as billion of longterm net inflows representing our 21st consecutive quarter of longterm feebased inflows we also saw meaningful strength in liquidity products with billion of net inflows from new and existing clients amid the industrywide flows into money market funds turning to page on alternatives alternative assets under supervision totaled billion at the end of the first quarter driving million in management and other fees for the quarter gross thirdparty fundraising was billion relatively solid given the current environment and bringing total thirdparty fundraising since our investor day to billion while we expect the pace of fundraising to slow for the rest of we continue to feel good about the path forward and remain confident in achieving our target of billion onbalance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately billion of which billion was related to our historical principal investment portfolio despite the challenging environment we reduced these onbalance sheet historical investments by billion in the quarter we are committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density including reducing historical principal investment portfolio to less than billion by yearend ill now turn to platform solutions on page revenues of million more than doubled yearoveryear driven by growth in loan balances in consumer platforms this week we announced the launch of a savings account for apple card users we are excited to deepen our partnership with apple through this additional offering and to introduce another source of deposit funding for the firm in transaction banking deposit balances ended the quarter slightly higher versus yearend while revenues of million were modestly lower quarteroverquarter amid higher deposit costs as we spoke about at our investor day in february were focused on further scaling this business with new clients and deepening our relationships with existing clients as we aspire to become their primary service provider in this regard we continue to see positive momentum on the platform as our client count grew by approximately in the first quarter on page firmwide net interest income of billion in the first quarter was down relative to the fourth quarter driven by increased funding costs supporting trading activities within global banking markets our total loan portfolio at quarterend was billion essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of million including the previously mentioned reserve release associated with the marcus unsecured lending portfolio and model updates which were only partially offset by roughly million in consumer net chargeoffs spending a moment on our commercial real estate lending portfolio as of quarterend we had billion of funded cre loans this portfolio is diversified by property type and includes million of exposure in the form of conservatively structured warehouse lending with typical ltvs of approximately turning to expenses on page total quarterly operating expenses were billion our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was quarterly noncompensation expenses were billion essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter but up versus last year the majority of the yearoveryear increase was driven by the aforementioned cie impairments as well as expenses related to nnip our effective tax rate for the quarter was for the full year we expect the tax rate between and the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 turning to capital on slide our common equity tier ratio was at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach basis points above our current requirement and at the top end of our management buffer in the quarter we returned billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of over billion and common stock dividends of roughly million while we expect to continue to focus on sustainably growing our dividend we would note that repurchases in any given quarter will vary though we find our stock price attractive at current levels in light of the current environment we expect to moderate our repurchase levels in the second quarter relative to the first quarter in conclusion our first quarter results were solid in the context of a volatile environment our robust financial position allowed us to focus on serving our clients and helping them navigate this period of market disruption across our leading businesses in global banking markets and asset wealth management we remained well positioned to continue to support our clients and execute on our strategic priorities with that well now open up the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi there curious you mentioned being optimistic about ma in the back half particularly on the strategic side im curious what youre seeing that gives you that confidence obviously it must be conversations and then what about the sponsor community thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah thanks glenn and so appreciate the question and youre right it has to do with dialogues and things that we can see id say as we came into the new year theres no question dialogues have picked up theres no question and i always talk about this when we talk about it broadly confidence affects the ability for people to move forward and be active in the ma market and certainly whats going on over the course of the last four weeks has slowed down some of the dialogues but when you think about big strategic activity i think most big companies continue to operate from a position where theyre trying to make sure they have the scale and the strength competitively to advance their strategies and so those strategic dialogues are quite active and if you actually look over the course of the last week or two there have been a handful of deals that have been announced that highlight that were seeing more dialogues like that and so were hopeful that more of that will come to fruition i just think thats a steady part of the diet the companies need to continue to execute on to improve their strategic position now with respect to financial sponsors were still going through a reset im encouraged by the fact in the quarter we saw one or two deals where kind of the bid offer between the value that a financial sponsor could achieve and the financing price came to meet there was a good data point and a selldown of a legacy deal in the market but i would say the financial sponsor activity is still muted and theres more upside as the reset on both value and financing costs continues i think were going to get there id expect more on the second half of the year unless the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 there was a really strong a much more pronounced economic disruption because it just takes time for people to reset weve now kind of gone through five quarters of reset and so generally speaking historically you kind of see these things turn on after four to six quarters so i would just expect more of a base level of activity from whats been very very muted glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc appreciate that and building on that your comment about companies wanting to build on their strategic position maybe we could talk a little bit about your transaction banking platform because its still growing im just curious in the march events that we saw did it cause any rethinking or maybe encouragement in terms of the direction of what youre doing with transaction banking and taking on those deposits and did you notice any was there any noticeable behavior of how those deposits acted during the march crisis thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc glenn its denis thanks for the question id say that our conviction around the transaction banking business remains very very strong i think what we were able to observe in the first quarter i highlighted in my script and its something that we are focused on strategically is we grew the client count by about in the quarter which is a similar amount to all of last year and were very very focused on continuing to improve our position with our clients offer them more and more services and grow this business steadily over the long term to create value i think in terms of how the deposits themselves performed over the course of the quarter they were in line with our expectations and as we indicated they ended on a quarteroverquarter basis up just about billion operator thank you well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess two questions one david you referred to the hyper volatility in the rates market but would appreciate if you can address just fixed income trading what happened there this quarter clearly there was some lagged performance versus peers to the extent you can just give us a flavor of what happened and your expectations around how things evolve from here how clients macro funds holding up in the face of this volatility david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so i appreciate the question i mean its been interesting this morning just watching what id highlight is i think we had a very solid quarter in ficc we had nearly a billion quarter and just to put that into perspective i think thats a topdecile quarter for that i think weve had i think it was the eighth best ficc quarter on record and i think weve had quarters so it was a solid performance and just a headline number of billion the way we look at it thats a very solid ficc quarter it was certainly a quarter with volatility in client activity throughout the quarter and i think we were well positioned to serve our clients and served our clients well now some of the noise that i see just in the early morning release our ficc business was down versus the first quarter of last year by but in the first quarter of last year we had the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 significant outperformance if i remember correctly our ficc revenues in the first quarter of last year were up yearoveryear when the competitor average was kind of flat or down and you can go look at that from a base perspective we had much more significant outperformance in the first quarter of because of our commodities business and the breadth of our commodities business so if you remember back in the first quarter of the war with ukraine started there was more volatility in commodities and clients were very active in commodities and so it was an outsized quarter in commodities in the first quarter of but overall i think ficc performance in the quarter was strong we were there to serve our clients and by any standards it was a good quarter i think given the environment that were operating in i would expect activity to continue to be active with our clients its certainly an uncertain period of time and theres a lot of movement in positioning and so were finding our clients active at the moment ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for that and then just separately i guess a big focus post investor day was picking up pace on asset sales how does the environment over the last month influence debtequity markets obviously held up pretty well ex the financials so give us a sense of just asset sale pace of debt how youre thinking about that and any change today versus investor day and how does that translate into pace of buybacks maybe in the back half of the year david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so we commented in the script about the fact that we made more progress on the disposition of our historical principal investments and we highlighted that we reduced them from just under billion to just over billion during the quarter denis also highlighted in the script that we feel on track to get to the billion target number that we laid out over the course of the next months we feel good about that progress and were going to continue to move to reduce that to zero over time there a lot of positions theres no question when there are market headwinds some of that might go a little bit slower but were on pace with what were trying to do and are committed to it and obviously we see a big change in that business as we grow management fees and we take the legacy investments that the volatility in that business we believe will change meaningfully operator well take our next question from christian bolu with autonomous research christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning david and denis just to follow up on the question on the markets business march did feel like a very tough month for some of your institutional clients we saw hedge fund closures were hearing of deleveraging so how does that inform your view of the outlook for the trading businesses and your market share particularly given i guess goldmans exposure to the hedge fund community david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so i appreciate that question were obviously very focused on share and our share gain we do participate with the hedge fund community but when you look at our big competitors they participate very actively with the hedge fund community too we also are very significant with the broad institutional community as i said just in the the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 previous question our clients are active at the moment because theres a lot going on were very focused on our market share as we said in our investor day we laid out more metrics and more of a focus on continuing to look at where we can advance our position with the top clients that we deal with in our markets business we continue to be optimistic about our share position our overall ability to serve our clients and we do think in this environment clients will continue to be active christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp great thank you and then maybe a question on capital return could you just clarify why you are slowing buybacks your capital ratio seems very healthy to your point that the stock is attractive at this level so not sure that i get it and then any comments on your appetite for strategic acquisitions here theres been a lot of stress in the wealth management space which is a space i know you guys are interested in so curious here if youre conserving capital to go on the offense denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure christian its denis thank you for the question around capital and obviously in this case appreciating the starting point in  where we significantly increased the amount of buyback activity in  we remained very committed to return of capital to shareholders committed to sustainably growing our dividend committing to the overall capital return profile but were also observing opportunities to deploy into the franchise on behalf of clients and there are elements of uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic environment and so our expectations is that buyback activity would be moderated but well monitor that over the course of the quarter as you say we do like the stock price and remain committed to return of capital to shareholders operator well take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start off with a question on platform solutions the business saw a stepup in expense i just wanted to understand how we should be thinking about the trajectory for expenses in the segment and similarly for provision going forward just following this quarters significant reserve release we know youd accrued reserves pretty conservatively for that segment but the top line momentums good would just be helpful to get some perspective on how we should think about both the expense as well as the credit trajectory from here denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 sure thanks in terms of the overall trajectory for the segment i think we have to step back our number one focus is driving towards profitability we also mentioned that we look to continue to improve the efficiency ratio thats certainly over the course of a period of time maybe not every given quarter but we remain committed to what we outlined as you say weve seen good top line performance of the business and on the reserve release it was a function of owning our pointofsale business for some period of time been able to observe it taken more data and greenskys actually performing better than we had modeled so that was a contributor to the reserve release in the segment as we think about it on a goforward basis its obviously going to be a function of origination activities across the platform we now have a reserve level of roughly in the consumer space so that can give you a sense of how to model provisions based on forward origination activity steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great denis and just for my followup on expense and really more of like a tickytack modeling question the expenses were a bit higher than expectations but i recall you noted at investor day the need to absorb some severance charges you also had some pretty outsized impairments related to the cie portfolio was hoping you could maybe help us quantify the level of onetimers in the expense base this quarter just as we think about benchmarking versus some of your longerterm efficiency targets denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you thank you very much so let me take that in pieces in terms of on the compensation expense any charges associated with severance and some of the actions that we took in the first quarter are included within our overall comp accrual which is at of our revenues net of provisions thats embedded inside of that number in terms of the change in noncompensation expenses they were flat on a quarteroverquarter basis but did include as you know million of cie impairments and so we thought it was important to call that out and that also explains a bunch of the yearoveryear delta between  and  that together with full quarter impact of nnip helps explain the delta in that line for the first quarter of this year operator well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 so just a couple quick questions here one on the consumer repositioning that you talked about today with the marcus loan sales and with your comments around greensky would you say that as those are done and dusted that would be it for the consumer repositioning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i think betsy what we said clearly is were narrowing focus we continue to be focused on our deposit platform and our credit card platform i do think there are opportunities for us to do other interesting things strategically and how we think about operating it but were going to continue to examine all the things that we can do to make that as successful as possible as i just highlighted we dont think were necessarily the best owner of greensky so were taking action on that and then well continue to move forward to bring the consumer platform the card platforms to profitability betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and so theres some nice capital release that comes from that how should we anticipate youre going to be utilizing that as we look forward here denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so as we see the capital release from some of those activities that just gives us incremental flexibility with respect to how we ultimately deploy that either back into the franchise andor returning that capital back to shareholders operator thank you well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just a little bit more on the consumer repositioning strategy how much in the marcus loans i think they were billion at yearend did you sell and what do you intend to do with the rest denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so we sold about billion of the marcus loans and the balance has been moved to heldforsale and so well be looking at moving down that position over time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and so the marks that you took on these loans how much of those marks were in the billion was it only a subset or the entire portfolio denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so we marked the entire we sold a portion of the portfolio and then we marked the balance to market and youll see that reflected in the million number moving through net revenues and our reserve release was million if you think about the portfolio overall for the quarter we generated incremental nii and we had the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 other net paydowns so for the whole quarter we generated revenues north of million and it was profitable for the quarter as we move forward into the second quarter well continue to generate net interest income on that portfolio and move down the balance of those exposures operator well take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions id like to follow up first on a question that glenn asked about the transactional banking in the past in conversations i believe that youve indicated that a lot of the competitors are the regional banks there so i want to confirm that thats the case and then given some of the stress that weve seen and concerns around some of those providers how are you adjusting your strategy in order to continue to build on the momentum that you seem to have shown here in the first quarter and if we see that continued stress would you pursue inorganic venues to add scale or capabilities david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yes so appreciate the question brennan we think in transaction banking we have a very good platform and a very good product and the feedback that were getting from clients about the product offering how it works what it allows corporate treasurers and cfos to do is very positive its obviously attractive for us to take deposits but we want deposits that are stickier and are here because people are operating on our platform and so were working hard to make sure as were adding clients were bringing the value that attaches the technology to what theyre doing in a way that grows that platform we are seeing positive results but this takes time these are longcycle decisions theyre not daytoday decisions and short term trades as denis highlighted we had good momentum in terms of customer count where people added themselves to our platform and so were going to continue to focus on that i do think given the size and the strength of goldman sachs as a gsib and the way were positioned were well positioned to compete with our clients for this business coupled with the fact that we have an excellent product offering so we are going to stay focused on that and we expect the business to grow over time brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color appreciate it and then for my followup you just announced this morning the new deposit arrangement with apple and the yield on that is pretty close to marcus a little above how should we think about the economics of that apple relationship and the deposit specifically and then how do you manage potential risks for cannibalization with your own marcus offering thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so thank you for the question so obviously this is something that we launched yesterday that gives us another deposit channel its the opportunity for somebody whos a credit cardholder to put a deposit on weve obviously looked very closely at the overlap between who holds credit cards and who holds who has a marcus deposit and that overlap is small but well obviously watch closely to see whether or not theres any cannibalization the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 but this is a way for us to try to open up another deposit channel and its always good for us to broaden our deposit base and so this is small at the moment and well watch it carefully but i think its an interesting opportunity for the firm operator well take our next question from devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning david denis i want to just touch on the equity financing strength in the quarter i know you kind of highlighted spreads and customer activity but also appreciate this is an area of focus for the firm bigger picture so just love to think about kind of where were jumping off of into the second quarter and whether the first quarter benefited from the march stress and then maybe idiosyncratic things that happened during the quarter or if this is actually a reasonable kind of jumping off point and just maybe a better outlook for that business for the rest of the year denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure i appreciate that question ill give you some context to help you understand sort of the sequential activity and the direction so our overall balances were a lot lower into the end of last year based on overall market levels and also as we reduced our footprint and so as we came into the first quarter were able to reexpand the capacity clients engage with us we saw an increase in balance increase in client activities increase in customer spreads weve had in place for some time a strategy to identify new types of clients that could come onto the platform and engage with us and so id say that were working sort of full speed ahead on that and continue to be very very focused on this as one of the key priorities within the global banking markets business devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay thanks denis just a bigger picture a followup here so it feels like goldman generally takes market share during periods of stress and so we just went through a pretty extreme period of stress in the banking system and maybe were getting on the other side of it but perhaps not and so with credit suisse now forcing an acquisition and capital likely becoming tighter in the banking system more broadly are there new areas of maybe opportunity for goldman to take market share or just in terms of where youre going to lean in with your balance sheet as youve done in the past how should we think about maybe a couple of the top areas where you feel like you can maybe incrementally take market share just as a result of what happened over the last month or so david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think our core banking markets franchise is incredibly well positioned you can see the performance this quarter i certainly wouldnt call it a top quartile for investment banking traditional capital markets ipos ma activity but with a roe in our banking markets segment i think its performing well we have the breadth the footprint the global franchise i think to continue to strengthen our share and as i commented a little bit earlier we continue to be focused on looking at our performance on the top now expanded to top clients and making sure that were moving up and capturing share and serving them well i do think given some of the things that have gone on there are other opportunities i think one of the interesting opportunities is the private wealth opportunity over in europe we see lots of customers that had had accounts at the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 both large swiss institutions with a consolidation were certainly seeing opportunity in our private wealth business as people want to diversify the private wealth relationships we have and so thats an area for sure that were focused on so we continue to look across both global banking markets and also asset wealth management for opportunities that we can strengthen our position and we think both franchises are very well positioned operator well go next to dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning wanted to follow up on the thirdparty fundraising youre having another great quarter but certainly highlighted that could slow this year and i guess thats not surprising given the environment but could you talk kind of longer term as you think about maybe a rebound as the economic conditions pick up and also the cycling of your vintages of funds in terms of what could be coming on line this year that might result in continued strength or some pockets of slowness as you kind of go through that cycle denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so thanks a lot for the question obviously this remains a big area of strategic focus for us with billion raised in the first quarter and now up to billion we feel very good about that we indicated that the pace could slow over the balance of the year but we do have about offerings in market on diversified basis across asset classes where were actively looking to raise funds i think its really the breadth and the diversity of our franchise thats going to enable us to continue to raise those types of assets different strategies will play towards different types of environments and having the breadth of offering i think is proving to be beneficial so even though we indicated it may slow later in this year strong conviction that well be on pace for the total amount that we had indicated just given what we see across our platform david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc and id just say dan that one of the things that happened to this business is as you scale and you have the breadth that we have in this business we set a target for but theres a longerterm goal and target and theres lots of room for us to grow and continue to expand our footprint and position given the offering that we have across the broad alternative spectrum the global nature of our platform and so this is still these are long dated fundraisings longcycle stuff but theres a lot of runway for us once we get past the target too daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks and then just a followup denis on the expense side the billion dollars of savings from realization of programs that you highlighted at investor day what was realized in the first quarter or maybe just remind us on the pacing of some of those savings as we think about the remainder of this year the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so at investor day we outlined that over the course of the year wed have run rate payroll expense of about million and noncomp efficiency about million and wed see about half of that reflected in this year and the balance thereafter id say were on target for those initiatives those efficiencies and we continue to look at it and we continue to see other opportunities to incrementally drive efficiency across our platform one area we had focused on for quite some time was the overall level of professional feels we continue to grind that down and if you look at some of the sequential components of our overall noncompensation expense youll see were making good progress against most of the line items operator well take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning david good morning denis denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc david in your comments about your principal investments you mentioned obviously market conditions will impact how quickly you get to your targeted goal of billion by the end of in those market conditions is it more the ipo and ecm markets that have a bigger headwind for you in this area or is it just general market levels and the activity were seeing david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i appreciate the question gerard and i think all these things contribute financing availability contributes on certain assets ipo market can contribute on certain assets and just general valuations contribute on certain assets i want to put the comments in perspective because i think that appropriately we want to make sure people understand obviously that when theres a lot of volatility or there are tough markets it might slow this down but we laid out at our investor day a plan to move over the coming few years to close to zero on the historical principal investments we continue to have a target to get to billion by the end of were confident that were going to execute on that target so i think the way to think about this is we laid out a multiyear plan to reduce this down to close to zero and were moving along on that target i wouldnt take the comments that on a quartertoquarter basis things can slow down i wouldnt overstate that but i want people to be aware that if the market or the environment turns more difficult that could potentially slow us down but were very focused on this and were going to continue to work to execute on a quartertoquarter basis gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 very good and i know you guys touched on the share repurchases slowing it down a bit and here in the second quarter youre very well capitalized if market conditions or i should ask i guess how important is it that the financial markets need to stabilize for you guys to maybe get more aggressive in the second half of the year in buying back the stock denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thanks for the question look i think it just gets back to how we think about our overall capital allocation framework and were looking at opportunities to deploy against our client franchise where there could be opportunities for incremental deployment given some of the disruption that were seeing in markets we want to remain mindful of that we want to remain committed to return of capital to shareholders and so were looking to strike the right balance while being mindful of the overall operating environment david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah id also i also just want to highlight when we spoke at investor day we said clearly that we are focused on accelerating buybacks that is still in place quartertoquarter may vary but that is still in place and so i just want that also kept in perspective too operator well take our next question from jim mitchell with seaport global jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning i think you hinted at improved dialogue levels in underwriting to start the quarter so can you just give a little more color at what youre seeing in the market and maybe how you see the ecm and dcm environment evolving assuming we dont have another major stepback in the macro david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah i think there have been some green shoots there were certainly some green shoots in february levels are still muted there were obviously a number of things out there that would like to get done and were seeing some indication of some significant transactions starting to prepare to get to move forward given markets seem to have settled down a little bit but i still think were at a belowtrend level as i said earlier in the conversation history tells you that theres plenty of capital raising that needs to get done generally speaking people have to use the capital markets to execute on these strategies but when you have these slowdowns and these windows closed they typically you get that rebalance after four to six quarters were kind of five quarters in and so my expectation or hope is we will see improvements from what have been very muted levels but at this point we had a very volatile march and id say things are still slow but we are starting to see some more green shoots again and well just have to watch and see how things unfold in the quarter and into the back half of the year jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 okay thats helpful and then maybe just on ficc financing i know thats been a focus of growth as well outside of equities saw a pretty strong improvement in spreads and volume but it doesnt look like we saw that in ficc anything to think about on the ficc side on the financing space and how you see that going forward denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure still very very committed to the ficc financing business which as we indicated was up slightly yearover year there continue to be good opportunities to deploy on behalf of clients i think a lot of the market share progress and client engagement progress that we made over the last couple of years sets us up as one of the go to calls for the provision of financing across the ficc space so that combined with the equity financing remain real priorities for our global banking markets business we feel good about it operator well take our next question from jeremy sigee with bnp paribas jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas thank you good morning could i get you to talk a bit more about the credit suisse opportunity in wealth management you mentioned europe but could you also talk a bit about asia and latin america are those regions where you as a firm have sufficient strength in wealth management to take more share from the swiss banks since theyre disrupted or is that a bit more marginal for you david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc on the second part of the question i think when you look at latin america its more marginal for us but theres we really do have a global footprint and there are opportunities for us especially as so many very wealthy individuals deal in dollars around the world we also have very very strong latin american presence that comes into our presence in florida obviously where our private wealth business is focused on latin america so there is opportunity there we continue to have a broad private wealth footprint in asia we havent been as focused on growth and investment in asia as we have been in europe over the course of the last couple of years we did launch a private wealth joint venture over in asia over the course of the last couple of months with icbc which i think is a small and slow opportunity but is an opportunity for us i think the interesting thing is whenever there is consolidation as we look at very wealthy individuals that are on our private wealth platform they tend to have multiple providers so whenever theres consolidation there are opportunities to talk to people as people then rethink their footprint and the diversification of their footprint and so our private wealth teams are very focused on that and the way we serve those clients jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas its very helpful thank you operator thank you well take our next question from andrew lim with société générale the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi good morning so my first question is about your focus on credit cards on the consumer side perhaps you can talk more specifically about what you see as your competitive advantages there and how you think about sizing up in credit cards in this point of the cycle its perhaps arguably quite late and some would argue that credit card growth tends to be a reflection of individuals not being able to manage their expenses in a high inflationary environment denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks so as you know we have our card platform business weve been building that over the last several years we have partnership with general motors a partnership with apple and weve been steadily investing in those relationships and building our balances as you indicate given the overall environment the total balances actually were down sequentially just given seasonality and given some of our credit underwriting standards and origination volumes but this is a business that we continue to invest in and believe its an overall piece of the firm that is diversifying andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk great okay ive got a second question more broadly about the crisis that we saw in march and how you think about how it evolved and maybe the repo situation as well so if we think about the svb situation obviously they decided to sell a lot of their assets below market value and in the process crystallizing a lot of those losses and i guess in retrospect it would have been a lot easier for them to repo those assets with the fed and avoid those marktomarket losses and i was just wondering if you could share your thoughts as to maybe why that didnt happen it would have been an obvious way to avoid a lot of the crisis of confidence that emerged from that situation david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i dont have a comment on that andrew there are a variety of factors in the actions that they took ultimately there was a bank run at svb and that led to the situation we are but im not going to go back and recount what decisions that management and that board made around that operator thank you well take a followup from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi first goldman specific and then general the goldman specific is why now on the consumer repositioning greensky sale and marcus loans and then more general question to what degree did silicon valley impact the capital markets and the advisory appetite out there thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah thanks mike so first why now its actually not why now its why over the last months is as you know we made a strategic decision kind of months ago at this point to really narrow our consumer focus and weve been executing on it and its not narrowing that focus making those decisions and executing on it are not the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 18apr2023 things that can be done instantaneously so weve gone through a very very thoughtful process and were moving forward in the execution of that again i think these things also i just felt like theyre small in the overall scope of goldman sachs the marcus loan portfolio was profitable but small it wasnt strategic greensky as we highlighted today we think its good business good platform and actually as we watch it perform its performing well but given the way weve narrowed our focus not strategic for us and so were simply executing on the decisions that we laid out and well continue to execute on them to do the things that we think are right over time to deliver for our shareholders on the second question which is just what happened in march how did it affect capital markets and ma i think it has an effect it was a highly as i highlighted in my comment it was kind of an unusual a twoweek period with really really outsized volatility as you and i discussed before whenever you have that kind of volatility it slows down capital markets activity so i thought we were starting to get a little bit more capital markets activity at the end of february ive noticed now equity markets seem to be behaving well debt markets are behaving reasonably well i cant say that there wont be some other event that creates stress there certainly are other things on the horizon that you could see that could create volatility like negotiation around the debt ceiling just to point to an example but i do think when you have that kind of volatility it slows down or has people push out things that they were thinking about bringing into the capital markets so yes i do think it has an effect and you can look at the performance in our investment banking lines in the quarter it was certainly a pretty muted quarter for investment banking activity for us and for the market as a whole operator well take a followup from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you just one quick question denis maybe around the apple savings deposit how do you intend to use the funds that come in appreciate early days in terms of the level of inflows that you may get on that product but is that money just going to sit in cash earning fed funds just trying to figure out what the nii revenue impact could be tied to those deposits denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks thanks ebrahim so across the firm we have multiple funding channels multiple sources that we tap in our bau activities we have multiple deposit channels that we also actively work with each and every day we view this as one incremental and diversifying source of deposits it enables to deepen our relationship with apple tap into their ecosystem and the clients that we serve together who are cardholders and want to sort of take advantage of the ease of moving into a deposit account and well take those deposits along with all the other deposits in our portfolio and deploy it into the client franchise operator that will conclude our questionandanswer session id like to turn it back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks carey halio chief strategy officer global
