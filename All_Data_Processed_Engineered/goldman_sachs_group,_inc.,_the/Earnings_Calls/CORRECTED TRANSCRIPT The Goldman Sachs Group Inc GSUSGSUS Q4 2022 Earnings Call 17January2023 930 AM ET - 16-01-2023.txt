good morning everyone thank you all for joining us today ill begin with a review of our financial performance simply said our quarter was disappointing and our business mix proved particularly challenging these results are not what we aspire to deliver to shareholders we generated revenues of billion and net earnings of billion and earnings per share of after nine straight quarters of doubledigit returns fourth quarter performance was certainly an outlier results were impacted by several nearterm challenges given the difficult operating environment on the revenue front underwriting volumes remained extremely muted despite green shoots that appeared at the end of the third quarter thinking equity activities activity levels dropped after a busy and volatile year for many of our clients and our equity investments portfolio saw continued headwinds we also saw higher loan loss provision and expenses while compensation expenses were down for the year quarterly expenses rose modestly versus the third quarter we always strive to maintain a pay for performance culture with revenues down compensation was lower that said we also recognize that we operate in a talentdriven business and we must continue to invest in our people whose dedication is critical to our worldclass franchise on our earnings call last july we first spoke about the challenging operating environment and the proactive measures we were taking on expenses including slowing hiring velocity and reducing certain components of our noncompensation costs the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 we have and continue to be incredibly focused on managing our financial resources especially in light of the worse than expected backdrop in the fourth quarter specifically we reduced the size of our balance sheet further optimized and reduced our rwa footprint and managed down our gsib score to hit our target we have also started firmwide expense reduction efforts to offset inflationary pressures and right size the firm for the current environment we made the difficult decision to conduct a head count reduction exercise earlier this month as we said we had paused our regular performance managementrelated reductions during the pandemic and also had a period of strong growth in head count given the opportunity set in we feel deeply for the individuals that were impacted by these reductions they are extremely dedicated and talented individuals and we wish them the best additionally were taking a number of strategic actions to help us reach our financial targets and create shareholder value for instance this quarter we completed our reorganization which will further strengthen our core businesses help us scale our growth platforms and improve efficiency this is an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey we also narrowed our ambitions in our consumer strategy and made some key decisions we started a process to cease offering new loans on the marcus platform we will likely allow the book to roll down naturally although were considering other alternatives in addition we have postponed the launch of our checking product at the right time in the future we intend to offer checking to our wealth management clients for now our priority is to strengthen our deposit franchise card partnerships and greensky our narrowed approach will allow us to reduce our forward investment spend and rationalize expenses were very focused on developing a path toward profitability in platform solutions and well provide more detail at our investor day next month as you can see from our new segment reporting we are committed to providing continued transparency for you to hold us accountable i want to spend a moment on the broader operating environment the backdrop over the last year has been incredibly dynamic there were headwinds we expected like high inflation but some we never thought wed see like the ongoing land war in ukraine there arent many signs of widespread distress balance sheets and company fundamentals are relatively healthy but its clear that the outlook for remains uncertain in the us central bank rate increases have started to have an impact on inflation but theyre also lowering the growth trajectory of the economy and the labor market remains remarkably tight with an estimated job openings available for every unemployed american our clients are thinking a lot about how to navigate this complex backdrop ceos and boards tell me theyre cautious particularly for the near term theyre rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more stability before committing to longerterm plans many firms have started preparing for tougher times focusing on factors within their control taking a step back i am proud of the significant progress we have made in our strategic evolution since investor day despite a more challenged fourth quarter performance we delivered for shareholders in we generated doubledigit returns in a year where rapid monetary tightening and ongoing macro uncertainty drove significant market disruption with both equity and fixed income markets falling for the first time in over years the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 we grew management and other fees by yearoveryear and grew net interest income by we reduced our onbalance sheet alternative investments by billion we also returned billion of capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we grew our book value by this brings our book value growth since our first investor day to almost roughly twice as much as our next closest competitor that said we remain focused on the work ahead of us and we believe we have a lot to play for as we go forward we are executing on three key priorities weve laid out for the businesses number one growing management fees on our asset wealth management business number two maximizing wallet share and growing financing activities at our global banking markets business number three scaling platform solutions to deliver profitability we have a proven track record of navigating a wide range of operating environments and we will continue to execute our longterm clientoriented strategy regardless of where we are in the cycle we have the people in place around the world to serve our clients broad range of needs with excellence and we are operating from a position of strength with robust capital levels and a clear focus on the path forward i remain optimistic about the future of goldman sachs and confident that we will continue to deliver for shareholders we look forward to speaking more about this with all of you at our investor day on february ill now turn it over to denis denis p coleman chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you david good morning lets start on page of the presentation in we generated net revenues of billion net earnings of billion and earnings per share of as david highlighted we have implemented our organizational changes which form the basis for our earnings presentation today turning to performance by business starting on page global banking markets generated revenues of billion for the year down as higher ficc revenues were more than offset by a steep decline in investment banking fees versus record results last year the exceptional performance of our global banking markets business over the last three years including the market share gains we have generated has served a strong ballast for firmwide performance in the fourth quarter investment banking fees fell yearoveryear driven by a significant decline in both equity and debt underwriting as issuance volumes remain muted amid continued market uncertainty advisory revenues however were billion the third highest in our history rising quarteroverquarter on higher completed deal volumes for we maintained our number one league table position completed ma as we have for of the last years and we ranked second in equity and equityrelated underwriting we also ranked second in high yield debt underwriting up from number three last year our backlog fell quarteronquarter on lower levels of activity but remain solid particularly in advisory that being said clients are focused on stability and financial conditions pushing out the timing of transactional activity while we expect investors will need more certainty before financing markets reopen more broadly we are seeing some positive signs of activity particularly in investment grade markets which have had a strong start to the year in both the united states and europe the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 ficc net revenues were billion in the quarter up year on year in intermediation we saw strength in rates and commodities amid elevated levels of client engagement catalyzed by increased central bank activity and rate volatility and improved marketmaking conditions if ficc financing we saw increases in secured lending driven by higher balances full year ficc revenues of billion rose equities net revenues were billion in the quarter down yearonyear the yearoveryear decline in intermediation revenues was driven by lower levels of client activity particularly in derivatives after strong engagement levels throughout the year financing revenues of million were relatively resilient despite a decline in prime balances as clients took risk off throughout the quarter across ficc and equities financing revenues were up in consistent with our strategic priority to grow clientfinancing activities moving to asset wealth management on page for revenues of billion were down yearover year as a steep decline in revenues from equity and debt investments offset an additional billion of management and other fees and a strong increase in private banking and lending revenues fourth quarter management and other fees of billion were up yearoveryear full year management and other fees were billion putting us well on track to hit our billion target in fourth quarter private banking and lending net revenues reached a record million up yearoveryear due to higher deposit spreads and higher lending and deposit balances equity investments produced net revenues of million driven by million of gains on our billion private equity portfolio and roughly million in operating revenues and gains related to cies partially offset by million of net losses related to investments in our billion public portfolio debt investments revenues were million including net interest income up million moving on to page total firmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record trillion driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inflows across fixed income and liquidity products lets now turn to page where i will review a new page in our presentation focused on our alternatives franchise alternative aus totaled billion at the end of the fourth quarter driving million in management and other fees for the quarter and billion for the year we remain on track to reach our billion target in gross thirdparty fundraising was billion for the quarter and totaled billion for the year thirdparty fundraising since investor day stands at billion the table on the bottom left shows our onbalance sheet alternative investment portfolio which totaled billion despite the challenging environment we reduced onbalance sheet investments by billion in of which billion was in the fourth quarter we remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more thirdparty funds ill turn to platform solutions on page full year revenues were billion more than double versus full year losses of billion were driven by billion of provisions as we built reserves to reflect billion of loan growth across the portfolio we also incurred billion in expenses as we continue to build out and run these businesses this included over million of transaction and integrationrelated cost driven by greensky and gm card portfolio acquisitions we expect these costs to also impact results though at a lower level and decline materially over subsequent years as david said our number one priority for this segment is to reach profitability and we look forward to providing you with further details at our investor day next month the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 on page firmwide net interest income of billion in the fourth quarter was up relative to the third quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances our total loan portfolio at quarterend was billion modestly higher versus the third quarter reflecting growth in collateralized lending and credit cards our provision for credit losses was million for our wholesale portfolio provisions were driven by impairments and portfolio growth the overall credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient in relation to our retail portfolio provisions were driven by continued portfolio growth net chargeoffs and a worsening of our baseline scenario were seeing early signs of our credit deterioration that are in line with our expectations we anticipate further pressure in given the vintage and nature of our portfolio lets turn to expenses on page quarterly operating expenses were billion total operating expenses for the year were billion down compensation expenses fell despite a increase in head count and were partially offset by higher noncompensation expenses the increase was primarily related to acquisitions transactionbased costs and continued investments in technology in addition clientdriven market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic as previously discussed were actively engaged in expense mitigation efforts this includes targeted reductions across communications and technology spend professional fees and advertising costs as well as the recent head count reduction exercise we expect that the impact of these actions will become more fully reflected in our results over time we remain highly focused on operating efficiency and are committed to our efficiency ratio target as the right place to run the firm turning to capital on slide our common equity tier ratio was at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach up basis points sequentially this represents a 130basispoint buffer to our new capital requirement of in the fourth quarter we returned billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of billion and common stock dividends of million based on our capital levels at the end of the quarter we started with a strong capital position enabling us to support our clients and return excess capital to shareholders as it relates to our funding plan based on current expectations we intend for issuance to run significantly below levels though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities in conclusion despite the challenging operating environment in we delivered doubledigit returns for shareholders returned billion of capital and made material progress on our strategic initiatives to better serve clients and strengthen and diversify the firm we remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and creating value for our shoulders and we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming investor day in february with that well now open up the line for questions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now take a moment to compile the qa roster operator instructions please limit yourself to one question and one followup question well take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much so given the capital rwa and expense actions that youve already taken if is a little bit better in banking but its kind of the same atmosphere weve been in because it feels like its lingering can you all get closer to your return targets this year i know its very difficult in this backdrop but what im getting at is do we need investment banking to be a lot better to get there or have the actions youve taken start closing the gap thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so thanks glenn and i appreciate the question obviously an improved capital markets environment would certainly help in that direction we talk about our targets in a normalized environment one thing i just want to make sure people are focused on is we have to do better in asset management this certainly has been a part of our strategy over the last three years is to reduce our balance sheet in asset management and weve made real progress on that over the last three years but we still have a very significant asset management balance sheet larger than wed like to have we reduced it by billion this past year and we intend to move forward but given the disruption in asset prices and the density of that balance sheet its not surprising when you have billion of capital allocated to that segment and if you look at the fourth quarter the fourth quarter it earned zero even with some businesses in there that are highly profitable i dont think thats normal i dont think our expectation is that continues exactly the same way and so i think a combination of some normalization in capital markets activities and a more balanced environment with respect to the asset management balance sheet certainly would have a big impact id highlight last year we way outperformed the peer average roe by about basis points because of kind of the massive outperformance of that balance sheet given all the stimulus and a bunch of that reversed and were just more sensitive to that denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc i mean things i might add glenn is in addition to our business mix on the forward i think the reason why were taking action with respect to our head count footprint and some of our noncompensation expenses is to drive efficiency even further and as you point out with the capital build that we have as at the beginning of the year were in a pretty flexible position in terms of how we can deploy that either in support of attractive opportunities within the business andor returning incremental capital to shareholders glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 okay i appreciate that and then maybe ph staying of the transaction banking is good but its unfortunately a small revenue base consumer may be music to some investors ears or is being de emphasized so i guess my question is wheres your goal is to build a more durable firm and i share that goal where do you think that comes from going forward if some of the pieces are either small or being deemphasized from the past strategy thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think glenn that the big thing in that and its always been a big part of it is the shift from a balance sheet intensive asset management business to a clientoriented feebased business our organic growth across our asset management business on a relative basis was still good in when you look broadly across the industry we continue to grow our management fees in the asset management business were continuing to grow our wealth business our wealth business overall grew nicely during the course of and so its that mix change less balance sheet intensive growth in asset wealth management continued financing growth in our core global banking markets business which youve seen and continue to grow and then getting these platforms that we have to operate profitably which we believe we can do we believe theyre good businesses at scale but theyre in a different stage of their development those things should make the business more resilient and thats not inconsistent with the strategy we laid out three years ago and we will amplify again next month at investor day what i think was an outlier for sure in this environment is the massive quick swing in asset prices and the impact that our capital marketsheavy and balance sheetintense business had of course was a drag from some of the investments were making in other things operator thank you well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thank you i guess maybe david just sticking to that as you make the asset management business less dense in terms of balance sheet consumption how do we think about the rote target you put out last year is that still achievable within the threeyear time period that you had laid out or does that get pushed out given the work that needs to be done and in a way that consumer is being deemphasized david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i think candidly that it depends on the environment an environment with massive swing in asset prices continues well push it out if that simply normalizes then the overall economic picture of the firm in addition to the work were doing on the expense side that weve gotten focused on will show a very very different picture im not going to guess on how that will play out but again id amplify that i dont think what we saw in was normal and certainly if you go back and look at years of history it wasnt ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc noted and i guess just as a followup in terms of growth in asset management wealth management significant asset price dislocations does that create some ma opportunities when you think about inorganic growth in those businesses or for the time being is the expectation that most of this is going to be organic the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i think at the moment were extremely focused on in executing on the decisions we made to invest in our platform and moving forward from here i do think that in the future there still could be inorganic opportunities to accelerate the journey in asset wealth management but certainly this year were focused on the execution we made an acquisition in asset management last year we want to integrate nnip we want to move forward with that so i think this year well be focused on execution ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator well take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so david and denis wanted to start off with a question just on the provision outlook admittedly the loan loss provision came in higher than we had anticipated i was hoping you could just speak to how much of it was growth math related versus deterioration in the macro and given some of the planned actions youre going to take for that business how should we think about like normalized level of loan growth and provision expectation that we should expect going forward denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning thank you thank you for that so let me help with some color as it relates to provisions particularly in the fourth quarter so order of magnitude the component of that build attributable to growth was about net chargeoffs about and the balance attributable to our scenario i think what you can see in the build of the provisions over the course of the fourth quarter and we do expect some of this to continue over the course of is that we began the onbalance sheet originations and our pointofsale lending platform greensky and so that obviously brings with it an upfront reserve build so thats something that initiated over the balance of this past year and will continue through the following year steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and maybe just for a followup on capital as it relates to the discussion tied to glenns question i was hoping you could speak to how youre scenario planning for basel iv basel iii end game recognize we dont the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 have a proposal yet but certainly it has significant implications for future returns you can generate youre running with a healthy level of cushion at the moment but just wanted to understand how you see it impacting your various businesses what planned actions can you take to maybe mitigate some of the pain denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure fair questions on everybodys mind as you note we dont yet have the details but we give it a lot of thought weve taken a number of steps in terms of building out our modeling capabilities to make sure as and when we do get an actual rule that well be in a position to respond quickly to that we do have a longstanding track record of responding to changes to regulatory guidance you can see over the course of the fourth quarter across a number of our financial resources that we were able to maneuver them very very quickly to build capital and change our rwa footprint given our view of the environment and some strategic decisions there so were standing by for more detail on the rule but confident that when we get it well be able to manage accordingly steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great thanks for taking my questions operator thank you well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions one followup on the consumer business i heard you on the markets pullback youre going to cease originating there does that give you more room to lean into growth and we should expect acceleration in the partner card greensky those pieces that youre keeping or is this markets pullback going to feed either capital increase or the ability to lean in other business lines like the isg business denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure betsy its denis ill start with that so as we indicated were going to cease the originations under markets lending and then furthermore expect for that portfolio actually to roll off or we may pursue other alternatives that should free up a bunch of financial resources were continued within the overall asset wealth management segment where the deposit business is resonant within the private banking and lending line that remains a the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 strategic priority for the firm and weve experienced very good growth there that business is achieving more and more scale so that will remain an ongoing focus i think once we have reduced some of the resourcing allocated to markets and lending well continue to narrow the focus of our ambitions and our investment spend and within the platform solutions business were now down to three different businesses transaction banking the cards platform and our pointofsale lending business greensky and our focus is really on just narrowing to drive those businesses across the segment to profitability betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay then separate question just on the expenses in this quarter i know you had the action of a head count reduction is there a severance embedded in this quarter that we should strip out because obviously its not ongoing or does that hit maybe you could speak to how we should think about that thanks denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks betsy because we communicated the reductions in any associated severance expense associated with those reductions will be expenses betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks operator thank you well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc oh hi i have one hey david i think its your birthday today right i think you announced that a few years ago david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yes good memory mike it is my birthday and i couldnt be happier to be on this call with you but thank you thank you for that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well since its your birthday do you want the positive question or the negative question first david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i want im happy to take any question that you have mike you know that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right well the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc were happy to take questions both positive and tough i mean it wasnt a great quarter so i dont expect all the questions to be easy mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well i mean it is concerning in terms of the reorg i mean well get more at the investor day and just a comment i hope you give us more data here we have three new sectors and you only give us the prior four quarters and the prior two years without much detail so i hope you give us more ahead but the question is you present the firm differently but will the firm actually be run differently other than the more narrow focus on consumer david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah and so i appreciate that and two comments first just on the transparency and information comment i think this management team mike over the last fourandahalf years has been super focused on increasing the transparency of goldman sachs and we remain focused on that if you have certain feedback on things youd like to see et cetera we really welcome that and carey will reach out to you and well take that feedback but were focused on giving our investors more and more and creating the right kind of transparency around what were doing second on the evolution and the move to this what id say and this has been something thats been a journey that we started a number of years ago but the firm is now organized and presented externally the same way we run it internally and that candidly is a difference than the way goldman sachs has been during my tenure at the firm in terms of our core business of banking markets there are synergies that weve been driving as these businesses cooperate that we think we can now get more out of in our client orientation across our broad franchise that this organization of those businesses together really helps i highlight that we feel great about the performance of those businesses since our investor day its long forgotten but when we did our investor day back in nobody believed that we could get the roe of the markets business above that was a big question on the minds of investors and we look now at our combined banking markets business this business we think is a leader it outperforms in terms of its market share it outperforms in terms of its returns relative to competitors and we continue to grow it and continue to stay laser focused on the client experience and also the returns and the performance of that business we also think there continues to be opportunity to grow our financing business there and were very very focused on that in asset wealth management weve worked hard to bring a number of businesses together into an integrated franchise so we can really have transparency and focus on our ability to grow management fees and drive performance and serve more clients in that business and as weve said over the last few years reduce the balance sheet intensity of that and were on a journey would i like it to be further along yes if it was further along there would have been less volatility particularly in the context of this year and the fourth quarter but we continue thats something we laid out three years ago and we continue to move at that the change strategically of a narrowing of our focus on certain things in consumer the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 business i think is a change we continue to feel very good about the deposit platform and the contribution it makes we think our partnership with apple will provide meaningful dividends for the firm over time we think greensky is a good business that can be accretive but the platforms are in a different stage of development than our other businesses theyre small in the overall scale of goldman sachs but we think there are benefits to that for the firm well communicate more as we move forward around that but were making progress and well continue to run that narrow focus in a way that we think can drive profitability so thats a highlevel response i dont know if theres something else you want me to drill into but thats a highlevel response mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah the followup is more specific i mean look you said its a disappointing quarter your returns are well below where you want them to be and variable revenues and variable costs not so much your efficiency ratio has gone the other direction so i mean i think investors would appreciate some detail on some of the benefits of what you might get on the expense side okay youre scaling back consumer as i asked you last quarter you said you were losing money maybe you lose less money the head count reduction should allow you to save money so can you ballpark the benefits to expenses from the moves in consumer and the head count reduction and along those lines now that youve moved capital well above the regulatory and your own firms target buybacks so cost and buyback kind of what to think about for denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure mike let me take that so unpacking a couple components so we exercised head count reduction earlier this year approximately employees left the firm the run rate expense associated with that group was approximately million and we expect to benefit in north of million associated with that beyond that we have a series of noncompensation expense initiatives were setting out guardrails for our business leaders to drive more efficient levels of noncompensation spend the narrowing of the focus in consumer is important there are a number of ways in which we could have chosen to expand the offering and capabilities of that but the focus is now narrow and then finally as you identify we have more flexibility with respect to capital deployment which we intend to take advantage of operator thank you well take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to follow up on some of those questions from mike and just really to be honest kind of surprised to not hear that there were restructuring and severance charges in the fourth quarter just given how elevated the expenses were so i guess can you provide a little bit of color on the inflexibility revenues down for the full year and i understand that of course markets are competitive but the positioning of comp in was to it was a remarkable year some of it even identified or segregated as special and therefore shouldnt be expected to repeat so was the discipline fully there are you doing enough on comp you have reiterated the focus on efficiency but the results here in i get it nobody is buying goldman today for results but still the results seem to set up sort of a challenging entry point for the beginning of the year the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so brennan a couple of questions as for the reasons to take severance expense in thats the accounting rules with respect to the timing of our communication to those employees so thats what explains the timeframe in which the expense is going to be booked as it relates to compensation expense variable expense flexibility in the fourth quarter i guess i would point out a couple of things one overall comp and benefit expense were down we had grown head count by additionally and when you thats over billion of less compensation and benefit expense so its a meaningful number and if you look at the components of our employee base we have a very large number of people that own relatively less money are impacted by inflation and are really important to the overall operation and delivery of our firm on behalf of our clients and we have relatively fewer employees that are higherearning employees face clients and generate revenue and were able to reduce the compensation substantially there in line with the performance but ultimately its a balance and we have excellent people we depend on them to deliver for clients the market for talent remains really robust and we had to strike the right balance between taking down that variable expense in respect of our performance while maintaining the franchise to make sure were in the position that we can deliver for clients and shareholders in and beyond certainly were going to have brighter opportunity sets on the forward and we want to make sure that were positioned to capture that brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thanks thanks for that color denis i appreciate that this one might end up being moot but i just kind of want to confirm that i was spending some time yesterday looking at previous disclosures of j curve expectation and whatnot but it seems as though exiting marcus and the tone down should we not even be thinking about a j curve for the consumer business is that not a consideration here any longer because it does seem as though the cross through from the breakeven even exprovision has been a lot longer than expected so should we just forget about that chart given the pivot or does that still remain part of the consideration denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc so a couple things i would point out as people would have seen in the earnings release this morning the platform solutions segment on a quarteroverquarter basis actually had reduced operating expenses so we remain really focused on continuing to drive at the expense of these platforms in aggregate and we expect to drive a lot of benefit at scale but as weve discussed and youll observe we also continue to build provisions as we scale some of those activities and so our focus remains singularly on driving towards profitability of the segment but there will continue to be a period of time during which we lose money until we reach that point of ultimate profitability and we do look forward to trying to help people to understand and map out that progression across the various businesses within that segment at investor day operator thank you well take our next question from devin ryan with jmp securities the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning david and denis and happy birthday david david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc thank you devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc i guess just first want to zero in on transaction banking here in platforms million for transaction banking and other in was up yearoveryear so you guys have really had great growth from scratch just a couple years ago but still obviously immaterial so just want to talk a little bit about how you feel like progress is going in that part of the business can this get to a multibilliondollar business just doing kind of what its already doing i know you just launched in europe there im really just trying to think about kind of the execution roadmap for that part of the business denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure thanks for that question were very pleased with the progress of the transaction banking business and its a business that has particular benefits as we scale activities on it we have our ph tac platform up and running we continue to grow our clients on the platform they unanimously continue to give us the feedback that it is a very differentiated and attractive platform to be part of and we have taken that business as you say from its inception to larger scale we think theres a lot of potential for that business on the forward and were very focused at this point in time in continuing to drive deposit balances continuing to drive our customer count further penetrate as you mention our international expansion continues weve opened in our fifth country we now have increasing capabilities to serve clients across the world there are true benefits to the network effect of a business like this with global reach and we continue to see very very good opportunities for this business devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay great thanks a followup here just on the markets financing opportunity so thats already obviously been a nice part of the story for goldman what do you need to do to grow financing further is it just a lot of the same kind of blocking and tackling are there specific things you can point to that could drive kind of another step function there and then just kind of more near term you talked about prime brokerage balances being down and declining through the quarter has that changed at all just to start this year with risk appetites maybe a bit better today than through most of fourth quarter denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah a couple comments i would make so i think as it relates to ficc financing we have a very good opportunity set in front of us the progress that weve made with the client franchise and our market shares and given the overall backdrop and the availability of financing in the world right now our clients continue to come to the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 us and given the capital position that we sit with at the beginning of the year we have capacity to fuel incremental financing activities in the ficc business on the equity side of the equation obviously asset markets moved around quite severely particularly in the end of the year which drives prime brokerage balances but as you know were also working very hard to reduce our financial resource footprint particularly our gsib level that brought with it significant rwa reductions and it was not really the environment that we were pushing on growth certainly in the fourth quarter i think as we turn the page on a new year there is lots of opportunity for us to continue to drive our equity financing activities and we have less constraints given that weve now achieved the gsib target devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay thank you operator well take our next question from dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning wanted to expand upon the new slide and ask as you look at the different buckets in asset classes how much of these funds are evergreen and open or are going through periodic fundraises and closings and i was hoping you can maybe provide some context on what the fundraising has been for subsequent funds meaning the size increase that youve typically seen for second or third funds from the previous ones to give us a sense of the momentum youre seeing in that business denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so we always have a very very broad portfolio of funds and weve been in this investing business for a number of decades its one of the contributors to our position as the number five largest active asset management firm in the world and across the portfolio of different funds we have some extremely mature businesses our gs capital partners equity investing business our mezzanine funds some of our loan funds we have multiple mature businesses that are frequently deploying successfully and then going back to raise new monies and continue to support sort of the franchises that we have in that channel and we continue to diversify and expand our offering and open up new strategies in response to what we see are pockets for client demand so as we think about the overall opportunity set we have a global broad and deep investing platform that has offerings for many different types of investors many of which are very very mature in terms of their track record and some of which are newer daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc okay and then just following up on the earlier question around kind of the ficc and trading backdrop it sounds like youre through kind of the optimization of rwas but maybe can you talk about where you see on the broader intermediation side the backdrop maybe the backdrop today and maybe where you see market share opportunities into the rest of the year the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so we continue to focus on market share market share data lags but through the third quarter of last year it shows that we continued to grow market share in ph part of those businesses sales and trading so that remains a very very core focus of the firm we continue to make progress and we think we can make incremental progress one of the attractive things about that business for us is that we have a number of different business lines which have enabled us to perform across a variety of environments the last year given what happened with rate normalization and energy markets around the world were a particular tailwind to the interest rate products business the commodities business meanwhile we had softer performance in credit mortgages and some of the equity intermediation activities certainly if the new issue debt underwriting markets come back online as early indications from the investment grade side of things suggest and if the equity underwriting activities are to open up theres a lot of activity that takes place with investors as they position in advance of and after new offerings that we should be able to capture given the investment that weve made in the client franchise so i cant predict exactly where activity will come from certainly some of it may be a continuation of those areas that were active in but its quite possible that certain activities that were softer in could rotate and become more relevant in operator thank you well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning you mentioned continued interest in asset wealth management deals kind of over time it sounds more like bolton but i guess just are you more openminded towards maybe a transformational deal as we think out not necessarily this year but just the next couple of years i mean todate youve what i would characterize i think most people would characterize youve ph piecemealed some deals youve done some organic expansion and mixed results in different areas but just thoughts on maybe more openness of something transformational down the road david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc i think weve been asked this question i appreciate the question weve been asked it a bunch over time i think in certain businesses like asset wealth management there are significant things that could meaningfully accelerate the platform and we have the fifth largest active asset manager in the world now that weve stood up all the businesses inside goldman sachs and so that scale is real and there certainly could be opportunities to increase that scale and certainly there are opportunities in wealth for us to do things that are more significant i would say that the bar to do those things is extraordinarily high there are not a lot of opportunities out there necessarily to do it certainly over the last five years the prices have been eye popping maybe were in a different environment where that will normalize but were always open to things that we think can strengthen goldman sachs but also as somebody thats been a ma banker for a significant part of my career i know the bar to do that the cultural issues the integration issues the bar has to be very very high so id say were always open but at the moment our focus is on executing on the plate of opportunities we have in front of us and we think we can drive good the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 returns good book value growth good performance for our shareholders as we look forward in the coming few years with what we have on our plate matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay that was clear thank you very much operator thank you well take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning david in your opening comments you gave us your three priorities of growing management fees in the asset wealth management business maximizing the wallet share and growing financing activities in global banking markets and then scaling the platform in the number two maximizing the wallet share can you share with us where are you today with the wallet share both in investment banking and markets and how are you pursuing to grow that over the next couple of years david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah so we you can take a look at our performance of these businesses and you can see that the performance is quite strong a couple of things ill point to even in this quarters performance you can look at our relative ma revenue performance you can look at our relative ficc performance and even our equities performance in whats been a tough quarter the relatives look pretty good we set out three years ago and this was a big structural change we had never really thought about client market shares in our markets business we had always thought about them in our investment banking business and we really we brought that ethos into the markets business and i know everyone on this call has heard us talk about how three years ago we set out to say there are clients that contribute meaningfully to our ficc and equities businesses and we are top with only of them we are now top with of those top and now we have shifted the focus to really look at okay top three but why arent we one and two what are the number of clients that we can be number one and two with and we think theres more room that we can drive on wallet share by really focusing on ficc and equities on that number one and number two position in banking the wallet share has really come from footprint growth that footprint growth candidly has been a little bit expensive when theres been zero capital markets revenue because that footprint growth does tilt toward capital markets activity but we think that will serve us well if you take a three or a fiveyear view looking forward so again theres a lot of attention paid to some of the things that were investing in the core of the firm is very strong those wallet shares are strong but we still see more opportunity and were laserfocused on continuing to execute on it and i dont think theres any business in investment banking and markets that is as strong and powerful as this business so well continue to focus on strengthening it as we move forward gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup on the shift in strategy on the consumer business youve been very clear obviously on how youre positioning this going forward i may have missed this so i apologize but what went wrong when you go back to when you guys started to move into these businesses three years ago or so i know the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 marcus deposits has been around longer than that but when you look back on what you were hoping to do and how it turned out what went wrong david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think there are a bunch of things that went right and there were some things that did not go well i think we executed well on some things and we didnt execute on others but the simple thing that i would phrase gerard and i think its a fair question is we tried to do too much too quickly and of course in the environment that were in its hard to go back where we started on that strategy six years ago we obviously built the deposit business the loan business and we talked about a much broader platform and i think we came to the conclusion that there were some changes one of the big changes that affect the pace of the ability to do this and its different in scaling things like this is cecl was a big change cecl changed the curve on growing these lending businesses at scale from scratch so weve had to adjust to that the regulatory environment has also changed over the course of the last couple of years but i think it became clear to us early in that we were doing too much it was affecting our execution i think we probably in some places havent had all the talent that weve needed to execute the way weve wanted were making adjustments on that but by narrowing down the three core things that were going to focus on that we actually think are good businesses that can be accretive to the firm i think weve got it in a place now where we can create a more cogent path forward and so thats what were doing and i the takeaway id like investors to understand is when we see things we look at things and we pivot were not married to things were willing to change i think when i go back to our investor day and i look at what we laid out during that period of time weve accomplished and have executed on the vast majority of things weve laid out that doesnt mean theres not more work to do but you know what we didnt execute perfectly on some so weve taken a hard look at those and you make adjustments and thats kind of the ethos of the nimbleness of goldman sachs that i want to amplify were always willing to make changes were always going to focused on shareholders and even though everythings not gone perfectly again id point to our book value growth since our investor day and id map that out our book value per share growth i believe its more than double the next nearest competitor so were going to continue to stay focused on the medium and long term i think were good at nimbly making adjustments and well always be very clear ph that when we get things right or we get things wrong operator thank you well take our next question from jim mitchell with seaport global jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just your thoughts on the outlook for investment banking appreciate denis comments weve seen a big increase in debt issuance saw some improving liquidity in the debt marks at least is that in your mind a leading indicator for beginning to monetize backlogs and just generally how are you thinking about the outlook for investment banking thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah sure i think that one of the things were dealing with and its overamplified in our very capital market centric business is that was not normal the second half of and were not normal they were way the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 inflated by the massive fiscal stimulus that created kind of id call on the spectrum of activity excess activity pulled a lot of activity forward and then because of market disruption weve tightened monetary conditions meaningfully in its the first year in over years that both fixed income and equity markets were down we had the sp down the nasdaq down you had a real change in asset values across the spectrum and when that happens it takes a period of time for people to adjust my historical experience would be that period of time is kind of four to six quarters and so if you think about it if somebody had a stock that was trading at and the stock goes down by certainly for the next couple of quarters theyre still thinking of but if its at for four five six quarters then its and suddenly when you look ahead and you think about either an ma transaction or financing you have more realism about the reset in values so i think were well into that journey of a reset in expectations think it might have another quarter or two to further reset but i think were starting to see some additional improvements people point to the investment grade debt market that would obviously be where it would come first but my expectations would be in the back half of meaningfully better and also its interesting and ill be heading to davos tonight with others but i was watching some of the commentary the macro commentary people are softening their view of and id say its getting a little bit more dovish or a little bit more of a softer landing than kind of where people were a quarter or two ago and that too will affect capital marks opportunity because its really tied to confidence so i think were going through that i dont think anything is fundamentally changed i think these capital markets businesses are still very big businesses but you shouldnt look at as normal just as you shouldnt look at as normal theyre normalized somewhere in the middle jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right and maybe just to follow up on the reserve and provisioning thats obviously been a big drag on profitability as you grow the platform business but as you shrink marcus is there also any desire to kind of slow i know greensky is growing on balance sheet but the rest of the business does that slow do we start to see provisioning slow given how high your reserve levels already are just trying to get a better picture on how to think about that cadence and maybe where your macro assumptions are in your reserve levels denis p coleman a chief financial officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so as it relates to slowing growth we actually did slow origination activity over the course of the fourth quarter over the course of the year weve implemented a number of changes to our credit underwriting tightening some of those provisions and so we actually did see a slowing of new originations that being said the vast majority of the provision build was attributable to the existing balances as opposed to the new originations so thats also something that were going to watch very carefully as things develop you noticed our overall coverage ratio increasing thats a function of what weve observed in our portfolio but as well as our macroeconomic outlook and so weve made some adjustments which reflect our best estimates for performance in the economy going forward operator at this time there are no further questions please continue with any closing remarks carey halio chief strategy officer global headinvestor relations the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript  earnings call 17jan2023 since there are no more questions wed like to thank everyone for joining the call and certainly
