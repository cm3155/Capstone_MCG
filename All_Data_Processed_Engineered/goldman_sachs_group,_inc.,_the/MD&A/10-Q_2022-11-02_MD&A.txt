liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure liquidity held directly in each of our major brokerdealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to group inc or funding ihc unless i legally provided for and ii there are no additional regulatory tax or other restrictions in addition the modeled liquidity outflow and intraday liquidity model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our gcla directly at group inc or funding ihc to support such requirements other unencumbered assets in addition to our gcla we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and

other subsidiaries we monitor local regulatory liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance for many of our subsidiaries these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the basel committees framework for liquidity risk measurement standards and monitoring as well as other regulatory developments the implementation of these rules and any amendments adopted by the regulatory authorities could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future credit ratings we rely on the short and longterm debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our daytoday operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings credit ratings are also important when

management our corporate governance and the external operating and economic environment including in some cases the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations such as potential resolution certain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings we manage our gcla to ensure we would among other potential requirements be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a twonotch reduction in our longterm credit ratings as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties but is available to them see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with creditrelated contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one or twonotch downgrade in our credit ratings cash flows as a global financial institution our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets consequently we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and assetliability

discussion and analysis market risk management overview market risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory investments loans and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value due to changes in market conditions we hold such positions primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities and therefore these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities since these positions are accounted for at fair value they fluctuate on a daily basis with the related gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of earnings we employ a variety of risk measures each described in the respective sections below to monitor market risk categories of market risk include the following interest rate risk results from exposures to changes in the level slope and curvature of yield curves the volatilities of interest rates prepayment speeds and credit spreads equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities baskets of equities and equity indices currency rate risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices forward prices and volatilities of currency rates and commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices forward prices and volatilities of commodities such as crude oil petroleum products natural gas electricity and precious and base metals market risk which is independent of our revenueproducing units and reports to our chief risk officer has primary responsibility for assessing monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses managers in revenueproducing units and market risk discuss market information positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis managers in revenueproducing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits these managers have indepth knowledge of their positions markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures market risk management process our process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the overview and structure of risk management as well as the following monitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures diversifying exposures controlling position sizes and evaluating mitigants such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives our market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of valueatrisk var and stress measures capture risk measures at individual position levels attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position report many different views of the risk measures eg by desk business product type or entity and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner risk measures we produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits these measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product business and firmwide levels we use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short and longterm time horizons our primary risk measures are var which is used for shorterterm periods and stress tests our risk reports detail key risks drivers and changes for each desk and business and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenueproducing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions valueatrisk var is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level for assets and liabilities included in var see financial statement linkages to market risk measures we typically employ a oneday time horizon with a confidence level we use a single var model which captures risks including interest rates equity prices currency rates and commodity prices as such var facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics var also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level goldman sachs september form 10q the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis we are aware of the inherent limitations to var and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process inherent limitations to var include var does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme var does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions and previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves to comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our var calculation we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position these market factors include spot prices credit spreads funding spreads yield curves volatility and correlation and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions as well as variations in market conditions we sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our var calculation the historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time this gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss as a result even if our positions included in var were unchanged our var would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa given its reliance on historical data var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions our var measure does not include positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures and the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected we perform daily backtesting of our var model ie comparing daily net revenues for positions included in var to the var measure calculated as of the prior business day at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries stress testing stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios we use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures we use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios including firmwide stress tests sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis the results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes see overview and structure of risk management for information about firmwide stress tests sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions eg equity prices or credit spreads using a variety of defined market shocks ranging from those that could be expected over a oneday time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur we also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously for example for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions as well as the corresponding debt equity and currency exposures associated with our nonsovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress when conducting scenario analysis we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts in addition these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forwardlooking hypothetical scenarios unlike var measures which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur instead stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors when estimating potential loss we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so limits we use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures these limits are set based on var and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures see overview and structure of risk management for information about the limit approval process market risk is responsible for monitoring these limits and identifying and escalating to senior management andor the appropriate risk committee on a timely basis instances where limits have been exceeded eg due to positional changes or changes in market conditions such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold andor a temporary or permanent increase to the limit if warranted goldman sachs september form 10q the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis metrics we analyze var at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels including by risk category business and region diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total var

increased to million for the three months ended september from million for the three months ended june primarily due to increased exposures the total increase was primarily driven by increases in the currency rates and interest rates categories partially offset by a decrease in the commodity prices category our average daily var increased to million for the three months ended september from million for the three months ended september due to increased exposures and higher levels of volatility the total increase was primarily driven by increases in the interest rates commodity prices and currency rates categories partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect our average daily var increased to million for the nine months ended september from million for the nine months ended september due to increased exposures and higher levels of volatility the total increase was driven by increases in the interest rates commodity prices and currency rates categories partially

increased to million as of september from million as of september due to higher levels of volatility and increased exposures the total increase was primarily driven by increases in the interest rates and currency rates categories partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect during the nine months ended september the firmwide var risk limit was exceeded on six occasions all of which occurred during march primarily due to higher levels of volatility generally resulting from broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns these limit breaches were resolved by temporary increases in the firmwide var risk limit and subsequent risk reductions during this period the firmwide var risk limit was also permanently increased due to higher levels of volatility during the firmwide var risk limit was not exceeded and there were no permanent or temporary changes to the firmwide var risk limit the table below presents our high and low var three months ended september june

september goldman sachs september form 10q the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis the table below presents by number of business days the frequency distribution of our daily net revenues for positions included in var three months ended september nine months ended september in millions total daily net revenues for positions included in var are compared with var calculated as of the end of the prior business day net losses incurred on a single day for such positions did not exceed our oneday var ie a var exception during the three months ended september and exceeded our oneday var on two occasions during the nine months ended september there was one var exception during both the three and nine months ended september during periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days we expect to have fewer var exceptions because under normal conditions our business model generally produces positive net revenues in periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected we generally have more loss days resulting in more var exceptions the daily net revenues for positions included in var used to determine var exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity including bidoffer net revenues which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature sensitivity measures certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in var because var is not the most appropriate risk measure other sensitivity measures we use to analyze market risk are described below sensitivity measures the table below presents our market risk by asset category for positions accounted for at fair value that are not included in var as of september june september in millions equity debt total in the table above the market risk of these positions is determined by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues of a decline in the value of these positions equity positions

and june in addition the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of million as of september and million as of june however the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity duration and convexity as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken interest rate sensitivity loans accounted for at amortized cost were billion as of september and billion as of june substantially all of which had floating interest rates the estimated sensitivity to a basis point increase in interest rates on

potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty eg an otc derivatives counterparty or a borrower or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in otc derivatives and loans and lending commitments credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks securities financing transactions ie resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities and customer and other receivables credit risk which is independent of our revenueproducing units and reports to our chief risk officer has primary responsibility for assessing monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses in addition we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk eg bonds and secondary bank loans these credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures which are monitored and managed by market risk we also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures such derivatives also give rise to credit risk which is monitored and managed by credit risk credit risk management process our process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the overview and structure of risk management as well as the following monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our credit exposures and credit concentrations establishing or approving underwriting standards assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default using credit risk mitigants including collateral and hedging and maximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims we also perform credit analyses which incorporate initial and ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations for substantially all of our credit exposures the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit evaluation or more frequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances we determine an internal credit rating for the counterparty by considering the results of the credit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterpartys industry and the economic environment the internal credit rating does not take into consideration collateral received or other credit support arrangements senior personnel with expertise in specific industries inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings our risk assessment process may also include where applicable reviewing certain key metrics including but not limited to delinquency status collateral values fico credit scores and other risk factors goldman sachs september form 10q the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis our credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries these systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product internal credit rating industry country and region risk measures we measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of nonpayment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure for derivatives and securities financing transactions current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements for loans and lending commitments the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position stress tests we conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors eg currency rates interest rates equity prices these shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements including shocks to multiple risk factors consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event in the case of sovereign default we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default unlike potential exposure which is calculated within a specified confidence level stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring we also perform firmwide stress tests see overview and structure of risk management for information about firmwide stress tests to supplement these regular stress tests as described above we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant we also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above the parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test we review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude highlight potential loss concentrations and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary limits we use credit risk limits at various levels as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring review escalation and management of credit risk concentrations see overview and structure of risk management for information about the limit approval process credit risk is responsible for monitoring these limits and identifying and escalating to senior management andor the appropriate risk committee on a timely basis instances where limits have been exceeded risk mitigants to reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties we may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis andor to terminate transactions if the counterpartys credit rating falls below a specified level we monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized we seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive for loans and lending commitments depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants risk mitigants include collateral provisions guarantees covenants structural seniority of the bank loan claims and for certain lending commitments provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts pricing structure and other terms as market conditions change the type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment when we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterpartys financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent we may obtain thirdparty guarantees of the counterpartys obligations we may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements goldman sachs september form 10q the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis credit exposures as of september our aggregate credit exposure increased as
