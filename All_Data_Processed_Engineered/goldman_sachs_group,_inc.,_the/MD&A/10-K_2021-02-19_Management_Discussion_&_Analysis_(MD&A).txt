consolidated subsidiaries of group inc references to this in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy in addition we have established a triggers and alerts framework which is designed to provide the board of directors of group inc board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for group inc rating agency guidelines the credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of group inc which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations gsco and gsi have been assigned long and shortterm issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies gs bank usa gsib and gsbe have also been assigned long and shortterm issuer ratings as well as ratings on their long and shortterm bank deposits in addition credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of group inc the level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation see risk management liquidity risk management credit ratings for further information about credit ratings of group inc gs bank usa

investment opportunities since these positions are accounted for at fair value they fluctuate on a daily basis with the related gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of earnings we employ a variety of risk measures each described in the respective sections below to monitor market risk categories of market risk include the following table start interest rate risk results from

measures to individual risk factors of each position report many different views of the risk measures eg by desk business product type or entity and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner risk measures we produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits these measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product business and firmwide levels we use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short and longterm time horizons our primary risk measures are var which is used for shorterterm periods and stress tests our risk reports detail key risks drivers and changes for each desk and business and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenueproducing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis valueatrisk var is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level for assets and liabilities included in var see financial statement linkages to market risk measures we typically employ a oneday time horizon with a confidence level we use a single var model which captures risks including interest rates equity prices currency rates and commodity prices as such var facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics var also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level we are aware of the inherent limitations to var and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process inherent limitations to var include table start var does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme table end table start var does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions and table end table start previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves table end to comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our var calculation we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position these market factors include spot prices credit spreads funding spreads yield curves volatility and correlation and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions as well as variations in market conditions we sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our var calculation the historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time this gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss as a result even if our positions included in var were unchanged our var would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa given its reliance on historical data var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions our var measure does not include table start positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures and table end table start the impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected table end we perform daily backtesting of our var model ie comparing daily net revenues for positions included in var to the var measure calculated as of the prior business day at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries stress testing stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios we use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures we use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios including firmwide stress tests sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis the results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes see overview and structure of risk management for information about firmwide stress tests sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions eg equity prices or credit spreads using a variety of defined market shocks ranging from those that could be expected over a oneday time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur we also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously for example for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions as well as the corresponding debt equity and currency exposures associated with our nonsovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress when conducting scenario analysis we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts in addition these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forwardlooking hypothetical scenarios unlike var measures which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur instead stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors when estimating potential loss we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis limits we use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures these limits are set based on var and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures see overview and structure of risk management for information about the limit approval process market risk is responsible for monitoring these limits and identifying and escalating to senior management andor the appropriate risk committee on a timely basis instances where limits have been exceeded eg due to positional changes or changes in market conditions such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold andor a temporary or permanent increase to the limit metrics we analyze var at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels including by risk category business and region diversification effect in the tables below

group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis during periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days we expect to have fewer var exceptions because under normal conditions our business model generally produces positive net revenues in periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected we generally have more loss days resulting in more var exceptions the daily net revenues for positions included in var used to determine var exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity including bidoffer net revenues which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature sensitivity measures certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in var because var is not the most appropriate risk

management overview credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty eg an otc derivatives counterparty or a borrower or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in otc derivatives and loans and lending commitments credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks securities financing transactions ie resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities and customer and other receivables credit risk which is independent of our revenueproducing units and reports to our chief risk officer has primary responsibility for assessing monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses in addition we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk eg bonds and secondary bank loans these credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures which are monitored and managed by market risk we also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures such derivatives also give rise to credit risk which is monitored and managed by credit risk credit

exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default table end table start using credit risk mitigants including collateral and hedging and table end table start maximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims table end we also perform credit reviews which include initial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties for substantially all of our credit exposures the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit review a credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations resulting in an internal credit rating the determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterpartys industry and the economic environment senior personnel with expertise in specific industries inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings our risk assessment process may also include where applicable reviewing certain key metrics including but not limited to delinquency status collateral values fico credit scores and other risk factors table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis our credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries these systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product internal credit rating industry country and region risk measures we measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of nonpayment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure for derivatives and securities financing transactions current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements for loans and lending commitments the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position stress tests we conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors eg currency rates interest rates equity prices these shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements including shocks to multiple risk factors consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event in the case of sovereign default we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default unlike potential exposure which is calculated within a specified confidence level stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring we also perform firmwide stress tests see overview and structure of risk management for information about firmwide stress tests to supplement these regular stress tests as described above we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant we also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above the parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test we review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude highlight potential loss concentrations and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary limits we use credit risk limits at various levels as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring review escalation and management of credit risk concentrations see overview and structure of risk management for information about the limit approval process credit risk is responsible for monitoring these limits and identifying and escalating to senior management andor the appropriate risk committee on a timely basis instances where limits have been exceeded risk mitigants to reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties we may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis andor to terminate transactions if the counterpartys credit rating falls below a specified level we monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized we seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive for loans and lending commitments depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants risk mitigants include collateral provisions guarantees covenants structural seniority of the bank loan claims and for certain lending commitments provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts pricing structure and other terms as market conditions change the type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment when we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterpartys financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent we may obtain thirdparty guarantees of the counterpartys obligations we may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis credit exposures as of
