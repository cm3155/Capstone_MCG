goldman sachs will finish rolling out its first generative artificial intelligence tool for code generation to thousands of developers across the company by the end of the month chief information officer marco argenti said the companys approach to generative ai involved centralizing all proprietary uses of the technology on an internal platform and restricting them elsewhere it might have slowed us down initially but then we definitely gained a lot of velocity afterwards argenti said taking this centralized approach obviously has pros and cons he added argenti said he had to push back against those who wanted to move faster and contend with some frustration over the banks decision to ban the use of openais chatgpt within its walls a step taken by other companies cios across industries facing pressure from chief executives and corporate boards to leverage generative ai are stuck between moving fast enough to achieve competitive gains but not so fast they leave themselves vulnerable to dangerous hiccups a number of efforts remain in the pilot or proofofconcept phase although ideation is gradually moving to more implementation this year said chirag dekate a vice president analyst at research firm gartner goldmans generative ai platform known as the gsai platform grew out of an existing machinelearning platform and is the single point of entry for all generative ai use at the company goldmans approach also included tapping partnerships with openaibacker microsoft to use gpt35 and gpt4 models and google for its gemini model the platform also uses open source models including meta platforms llama the ability to switch between models for different use cases is a key benefit of the approach argenti said critically the internal platform also allows goldman to finetune the models with its own internal data in a safe way and that complies with regulations argenti said controls are embedded to ensure that models arent serving up data to employees who shouldnt have access to it for example select goldman employees can access the platform directly to interface with various models and developers are using it to build custom applications on top of the models such as a copilot assistant tool for investment bankers that searches a large body of public and proprietary documents to answer questions and extract analysis the other benefit of the platform is being able to build more applications faster argenti said developers dont have to start from scratch with every application a copilot for asset managers can lean heavily on the copilot for investment bankers and all the safety guardrails are already builtin from the beginning argenti said the speed at which developers are building generative ai applications has shortened from months to weeks as a result but at the same time the company isnt rushing them into production ai is a new thing he said safety and responsibility is absolutely our no priority the need to safeguard data remain compliant with existing data regulations and prepare for any new ai regulations are key factors that help determine the speed with which financial services adopt ai said gartners dekate financial services is one of the most regulated ecosystems he added code generation is a common starting point for many entities because it is textcentric and provides clear tangible efficiency gains he said goldmans generative ai coding assistant microsofts github copilot is the firms most scaledout use of ai so far argenti said it is giving developers about a increase in efficiency the company is also in earlier stages of rolling out an ai tool that translates documents into other languages and an application that summarizes proprietary research to provide insights to advisers generative ai remains a relatively small part of the technology budget argenti said a crypto enthusiast approached sharmin mossavarrahmani a couple of years ago asking why she was so negative about digital currencies mossavarrahmani was accustomed to defending her stance as the chief investment officer of goldman sachs wealth management for the past years she has guided thousands of wealth advisers clients and traders and regularly appears on television this time she was being questioned by a goldman sachs intern who said she owned cryptocurrencies mossavarrahmani dismissed investing in crypto as nothing more than a means of speculation have you thought about what its worth mossavarrahmani recalled asking in that summer of have you thought about at what point youll get out the intern didnt give much of an answer she also didnt seem eager to sell her crypto so it goes for mossavarrahmani a highprofile market prognosticator who has gotten a lot right over the past few years since the global financial crisis she has urged clients to stay fully invested in us stocks and minimize their exposure to china and other emergingmarket countries advice that has made investors money amid the markets climb since that perilous period when it comes to crypto mossavarrahmani remains skeptical even as bitcoin has soared this year to nearly her position puts her at risk of costing goldman clients potential gains while appearing out of step with markets wall street giants including blackrock and fidelity have embraced bitcoin launching funds in january that make it easy for everyday investors to invest in it some financial advisers also have begun advising clients to include crypto in their portfolios mossavarrahmani couldnt care less what the others do we do not think it is an investment asset class she said in an interview comparing the recent crypto enthusiasm to the tulip mania of the were not believers in crypto she says clients are well aware of her teams crypto criticisms and havent asked about jumping in mossavarrahmanis view is based on the fact that it is nearly impossible to accurately value cryptocurrencies which dont produce earnings cash flow or dividends if you cannot assign a value then how can you be bullish or bearish she asks rhetorically in june mossavarrahmani and her colleagues published a critique of crypto titled digital assets beauty is not in the eye of the beholder the 50page piece argued that bitcoin is too volatile to be a reliable medium of exchange and that it is unlikely that it will be used broadly the observations have held up but bitcoins price has more than doubled since then mossavarrahmani says she isnt feeling pressure to alter her views in fact she is as skeptical as ever on bitcoin which she says creates absolutely no value in any shape or form whats more she says crypto bulls all proclaim democratization of finance yet the main decisions end up being driven by a few controlling people plenty of people disagree with her conclusions matt hougan chief investment officer of crypto asset manager bitwise argues that just because an investment doesnt have cash flow doesnt mean it doesnt have value bitcoin had no cash flow years ago and yet its up hougan says adding that it has done well in periods of high and low inflation as well as rising and falling interest rates the world is full of things that produce no cash flow but have value he says pointing to gold art and collectibles bitcoin also offers a service hougan says the ability to securely store wealth without relying on a centralized institution mossavarrahmani and her colleagues acknowledge the potential benefits of converting assets like real estate into digital tokens and say centralbank digital currencies could eventually be useful mossavarrahmani acknowledges that gold too doesnt produce earnings and is hard to value yet has been historically popular as an investment and for jewelry that isnt enough of a reason to own crypto though she says at least you can hold onto physical gold and store it you cant do that with crypto she says and anyway we dont encourage people to own gold
