weather events our business continuity technology resilience program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities or

misappropriation corruption or loss safeguards are designed to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of information human capital management we believe that a major strength and principal reason for our success is the quality and dedication of our people and the shared sense of being part of a team we strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism excellence diversity cooperation among our employees worldwide and high standards of business ethics table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries instilling our culture in all employees is a continuous process in which training plays an important part all employees are offered the opportunity to participate in education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various locations throughout the world another important part of instilling our culture is our employee review process employees are reviewed by supervisors coworkers and employees they supervise in a 360degree review process that is integral to our team approach and which includes an evaluation of an employees performance with respect to risk management compliance and diversity as of december we had headcount of competition the financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive and we expect them to remain so our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking including transaction banking marketmaking investment management services and commercial andor consumer lending and deposittaking products as well as those entities that make investments in securities commodities derivatives real estate loans and other financial assets these entities include brokers and dealers investment banking firms commercial banks credit card issuers insurance companies investment advisers mutual funds hedge funds private equity funds merchant banks consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internetbased companies we compete with some entities globally and with others on a regional product or niche basis we compete based on a number of factors including transaction execution products and services innovation reputation and price we have faced and expect to continue to face pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks in particular corporate clients seek such commitments such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets as a result we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions to take advantage of some of our most significant opportunities we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the us we also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services such as independent advisory firms some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are and as described below our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them a number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking marketmaking and asset management businesses for example the increasing volume of trades executed electronically through the internet and through alternative trading systems has increased the pressure on trading commissions in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for nonelectronic trading it appears that this trend toward lowcommission trading will continue price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it ie bidoffer spread which has affected our marketmaking businesses in addition we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution we also compete on the basis of the types of financial products that we and our competitors offer in some circumstances our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer the provisions of the us doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act the requirements promulgated by the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee and other financial regulations could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitations on activities increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply or do not apply equally to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions for example the provisions of the doddfrank act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between usbased and nonusbased banking organizations and give nonusbased banking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the us and to form and invest in funds outside the us table start goldman sachs form 10k table end the goldman sachs group inc and subsidiaries likewise the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under title vii of the doddfrank act depend in part on the location of the counterparties to the transaction the impact of the doddfrank act and other regulatory developments on our competitive position has depended and will continue to depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve the extent of international convergence and the development of market practice and structures under the new regulatory regimes as described further in regulation below we also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees our ability to continue to compete effectively has depended and will continue to depend upon our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by and the standards of the frb and other regulators inside and outside the us including the prudential regulation authority pra and the financial conduct authority fca in the uk we also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight see regulation compensation practices and risk factors our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees in part i item of this form 10k for further information about such regulation regulation as a participant in the global financial services industry we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide the regulatory regimes applicable to our operations worldwide have recently been and continue to be subject to significant changes the basel committee is the primary global standard setter for prudential bank regulation however its standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules to implement its standards the implications of these regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally and the market practices and structures that develop new regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide as described below recent developments have added additional uncertainty to the implementation scope and timing of regulatory reforms and potential for deregulation in some areas the effects of any changes to the regulations affecting our businesses including as a result of the proposals described below are uncertain and will not be known until the changes are finalized and market practices and structures develop under the revised regulations our principal subsidiaries operating in europe goldman sachs international gsi gsib and goldman sachs asset management international gsami are incorporated and headquartered in the uk as a result of the uks withdrawal from the eu brexit we expect considerable change in the regulatory framework that will govern transactions and business undertaken by our uk subsidiaries the eu and the uk agreed to a withdrawal agreement the withdrawal agreement which became effective on january when the uk ceased to be an eu member state the transition period under the withdrawal agreement will last until the end of december and the uk government has stated that it does not intend to agree to an extension to this period during the transition period the uk will be treated as if it were a member state of the eu and therefore our uk subsidiaries will still benefit from nondiscriminatory access to eu clients and infrastructure at the end of the transition period firms established in the uk including our uk subsidiaries are expected to lose their paneu passports and generally to be treated like entities in countries outside the eu whose access to the eu is governed by eu and national law and may depend on the making of eu equivalence decisions or on their obtaining licenses or exemptions under national regimes subject to any other arrangements such as a free trade agreement after the end of the transition period the uk will not be required to continue to apply eu financial services legislation and may not adopt rules that
