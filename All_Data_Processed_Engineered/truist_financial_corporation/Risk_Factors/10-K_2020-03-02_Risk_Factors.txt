item risk factors the following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect truists financial condition and operations when a risk factor spans several risk categories the risks have been listed by their primary risk category the risks described are not all inclusive additional risks that are not presently known or risks deemed immaterial may have a material adverse effect on truists financial condition results of operations business and prospects mergerrelated risks truist may not be able to successfully integrate the companies or to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger the company was formed by the merger of bbt and suntrust on december truist anticipates further integration of systems operations and personnel of bbt and suntrust over the next several years the successful integration of bbts and suntrusts operations will depend substantially on the companys ability to successfully consolidate operations management teams corporate cultures systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs truist may encounter difficulties during integration such as the loss of key employees and clients the disruption of operations and businesses inability to maintain and increase competitive presence loan deposit and revenue attrition inconsistencies in standards control procedures and policies unexpected issues with planned branch and other facilities closures unexpected issues with costs operations personnel technology and problems with the assimilation of new operations sites or personnel integration activities could divert resources from regular operations in addition general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit the companys successful integration of these entities bbt and suntrust merged with the expectation that the merger would result in various synergies including among other things benefits relating to enhanced revenues a strengthened and expanded market position for the combined organization technology efficiencies cost savings and operating efficiencies achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether the company integrates the institutions in an efficient and effective manner as well as general competitive factors in the marketplace failure to achieve or delays in achieving these anticipated benefits could result in a share price reduction as well as increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy and could materially and adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations business and prospects truist will continue to incur substantial expenses related to the merger and the integration there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated in addition the merger may increase the companys compliance and legal risks including increased litigation or regulatory actions such as fines or restrictions related to the business practices or operations of the combined business while the company has assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred there are many factors beyond the companys control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the expected savings from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale the amount and timing of future charges to earnings as a result of merger or integration expenses are uncertain truist financial corporation market risks changes in interest rates could adversely affect revenue and expenses the value of assets and liabilities as well as the availability and cost of capital cash flows and liquidity truists balance sheet can be sensitive to movements in market interest rates and spreads as well as basis risk arising from the companys alm activities which management must closely monitor in addition to the impact of the general economy changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact the company in one or more of the following ways the yield on earning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities may change in disproportionate ways or the value of financial instruments held could change adversely regional and local economic conditions competitive pressures and the policies of regulatory authorities affect interest income and interest expense when interest rates rise funding costs may rise faster than the yield the company earns on assets causing net interest margin to contract higher interest rates may also result in lower mortgage production income and elevated chargeoffs in certain categories of the loan portfolio conversely when interest rates fall the yield the company earns on assets may fall faster than the companys ability to lower rates paid on deposits or borrowings certain investment securities notably mbs are very sensitive to changes in rates generally when rates rise prepayments will decrease and the duration of mbs will increase conversely when rates fall prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mbs will decrease the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on profitability changes in monetary and fiscal policies including frb policies can adversely affect profitability and cannot be controlled or predicted by the company frb policies can significantly impact the cost of funds as well as the return on assets both of which can have an impact on interest income materially affect the value of financial assets adversely affect borrowers through higher debt servicing costs and potentially increase the risk that they may fail to repay their loan obligations and artificially inflate asset values during prolonged periods of accommodative policy which could in turn cause volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values financial results lending or other business activities could be materially affected by a deterioration of economic conditions a prolonged period of slow growth in the us economy as a whole or in any regional markets that truist serves or any deterioration in economic conditions or the financial markets may disrupt or dampen the economy which could materially adversely affect the companys financial condition and results if economic conditions deteriorate the company may see lower demand for loans by creditworthy clients reducing the companys interest income in addition if unemployment levels increase or if real estate prices decrease the company would expect to incur higher chargeoffs and may incur higher expenses in connection with adjustments to the reasonable and supportable forecasts used to estimate the allowance for credit losses in accordance with cecl requirements these conditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan performance but also commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans especially for those businesses that rely on the health of industries or properties that may suffer from deteriorating economic conditions the ability of these borrowers to repay their loans may be reduced causing the company to incur higher credit losses the deterioration of economic conditions also could adversely affect financial results for the companys feebased businesses including the companys insurance brokerage wealth management investment advisory trading and investment banking businesses truist earns fee income from among other activities managing assets for clients and providing brokerage and other investment advisory and wealth management services investment management fees are often based on the value of assets under management and a decrease in the market prices of those assets could reduce the companys fee income changes in stock or fixed income market prices or client preferences could affect the trading activity of investors reducing commissions and other fees earned from the companys brokerage business poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial markets would likely adversely affect the companys capital marketsrelated businesses truist financial corporation instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters as well as volatility in financial markets could have a material adverse effect on the companys operations earnings and financial condition instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters as well as volatility in financial markets could have a material adverse effect on the companys operations earnings and financial condition the macroeconomic environment in the united states is susceptible to global events and volatility in financial markets for example trade negotiations between the us and other nations remains uncertain and could adversely impact economic and market conditions for the company and its clients and counterparties a negative change in economic conditions the performance of foreign sovereign debt changes of trade policies and other matters could adversely affect the companys business financial condition and liquidity domestic and global political activity geopolitical matters including international political unrest or disturbances terrorist activities military conflicts concerns over energy prices trade wars and economic instability or recession in certain regions could cause volatility in the financial markets undermine investor confidence or cause a contraction of available credit any of these could reduce the value of the companys assets or cause a reduction in liquidity that adversely impacts the companys financial condition and results of operations the replacement of libor could adversely affect truists profitability and financial condition libor and certain other interest rate benchmarks are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor has publicly announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit information to the administrator of libor after the continuation of libor cannot be guaranteed after truist has liborbased contracts that extend beyond included in loans and leases securities deposits shortterm borrowings longterm debt and derivative financial instruments while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor a group of market participants convened by the frb the arrc has selected the sofr as its recommended alternative to us dollar libor the frb of new york started to publish sofr in april sofr is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by us treasury securities if sofr or another alternative reference rate becomes an accepted alternative to libor it may perform differently than libor in response to changing market conditions for example sofr could experience greater decreases during times of economic stress which could require the company to lend at lower rates at times when the companys borrowing costs are increasing the market transition away from libor to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on the companys business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of the companys liborbased assets and liabilities adversely affect the interest rates received or paid on the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the companys preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate and result in disputes litigation or other actions with borrowers or counterparties about the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased contracts and securities the transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate will require the transition to or development of appropriate systems models and analytics to effectively transition the companys risk management and other processes from liborbased products to those based on the applicable alternative reference rate such as sofr truist has developed a libor transition team and project plan that outlines timelines and priorities to prepare its processes systems and people to support this transition timelines and priorities include assessing the impact on the companys clients as well as assessing system requirements for operational processes there can be no guarantee that these efforts will successfully mitigate the operational risks associated with the transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate the manner and impact of the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate as well as the effect of these developments on the companys funding costs loan investment and trading securities portfolios and alm and business is uncertain truist financial corporation credit risks the company is subject to credit risk by lending or committing money or entering into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty truist incurs credit risk which is the risk of losses if the companys borrowers do not repay loans or if the companys counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their contracts a number of products expose the company to credit risk including loans leveraged loans leases and lending commitments derivatives trading assets and assets held for sale changes in credit quality can have a significant impact on the companys earnings the company estimates and establishes reserves for credit risks and credit losses inherent in its determination of credit exposure including unfunded credit commitments this process which is critical to the companys financial results and condition requires difficult subjective and complex judgments considering both external and borrowerspecific factors that might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans as is the case with any such assessments there is always the chance that the company will fail to identify the proper factors or that the company will fail to accurately estimate the impacts of factors identified credit losses may exceed the amount of the companys reserves as a result of changing economic conditions including falling real estate or commodity prices and higher unemployment or other factors such as changes in borrower behavior there is no assurance that reserves will be sufficient to cover all incurred credit losses in the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions the company may be required to increase reserves in future periods which would reduce the companys earnings and potentially impact its capital the company may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the extent that loans are concentrated by loan type industry segment borrower type or location of the borrower or collateral the companys credit risk and credit losses can increase if the companys loans are concentrated in borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or in borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions deterioration in economic conditions housing conditions or real estate values in these markets in which the company operates could result in materially higher credit losses liquidity risks truists liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access shortterm funding an unforeseen outflow of cash or a reduction in the credit ratings for truist or its subsidiaries liquidity is essential to truists businesses when volatility or disruptions occur in the wholesale funding markets the companys ability to access shortterm liquidity could be materially impaired in addition other factors outside of the companys control such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties could impair the companys ability to access shortterm funding or create an unforeseen outflow of cash or deposits the companys inability to access shortterm funding or capital markets could constrain the companys ability to make new loans or meet existing lending commitments and could ultimately jeopardize the companys overall liquidity and capitalization loss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase truists funding costs deposits are a low cost and stable source of funding truist competes with banks and other financial institutions for deposits and as a result could risk losing deposits in the future or see an increase in costs associated with maintaining deposits clients may shift their deposits into higher cost products or the company may need to raise interest rates to avoid deposit attrition funding costs may also increase if deposits lost are replaced with wholesale funding higher funding costs reduce truists net interest margin net interest income and net income truist relies on the mortgage secondary market and gses for some of the companys liquidity truist sells a portion of the mortgage loans originated to reduce the companys retained credit risk and to provide funding capacity for originating additional loans gses could limit their purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints or other changes in their criteria for conforming loans eg maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility this potential reduction in purchases could limit the ability to fund new loans proposals have been presented to reform the housing finance market in the us including the role of the gses in the housing finance market the extent and timing of any such regulatory reform of the housing finance market and the gses as well as any effect on the companys business and financial results are uncertain truist financial corporation any reduction in the companys credit rating could increase the cost of the companys funding from the capital markets ratings agencies regularly evaluate truist and its subsidiaries ratings are based on a number of factors including the financial strength of the company as well as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect funding cost and increase the companys cost of capital a credit downgrade might also affect the companys ability to attract or retain deposits from commercial and corporate clients additionally the companys ability to conduct derivatives business with certain clients and counterparties could also be impacted and could trigger obligations to make cash or collateral payments to certain clients and counterparties the parent company has less access to funding sources and liquidity could be constrained if the bank becomes unable to pay dividends during a time of stress the parent company relies upon capital markets access and dividends from affiliates for funding and has less access to contingent sources than the bank if the bank were subject to a financial stress its dividends to the parent company could be reduced or eliminated in order to support bank capital ratios or other regulatory requirements this would increase the parent companys reliance on capital markets at a time when spreads and funding costs are likely elevated due the stress impacting the bank compliance risks truist is subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision which could increase the cost of doing business limit truists ability to make investments and generate revenue and lead to costly enforcement actions the banking and financial services industries are highly regulated truist is subject to supervision regulation and examination by regulators including the frb fdic nccob sec cftc cfpb finra and various state regulatory agencies the statutory and regulatory framework governing truist is generally intended to protect depositors the dif clients and the us financial system as a whole and not truists debt holders or shareholders reform of the financial services industry resulting from the doddfrank act including the egrrcpa and other legislative regulatory and technological changes affect the companys operations these laws and regulations and truists inability to act in certain instances without receiving prior regulatory approval affect truists lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy ability to repurchase common stock and ability to pursue strategic acquisitions among other activities changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation and the continued heightening of regulatory requirements could affect truist in substantial and unpredictable ways federal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate these supervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements higher deposit insurance premiums and limitations on the companys activities that could have a material adverse effect on operations or profitability in recent years both congress and the federal banking regulators have engaged in a rebalancing of the post financial crisis legal and regulatory framework particularly by tailoring enhanced prudential standards to the size risk profile and complexity of the banking organization it is possible that a new presidential administration and a new congress could reconsider this rebalancing of the legal and regulatory framework and also impose significant new regulatory and supervisory burdens on the financial sector truist expects that its businesses will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision regardless of who wins the presidential and congressional elections in any potential new regulations or modifications to existing regulations would likely necessitate changes to truists existing regulatory compliance and risk management infrastructure compliance with new regulations and supervisory initiatives including those newly applicable as a result of the merger may increase costs truist is subject to heightened requirements under the enhanced prudential standards and expects increased supervisory scrutiny including for example single counterparty credit limits heightened expectations with respect to governance risk management and internal controls and additional capital and liquidity requirements the financial services industry faces scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and stringent enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels areas of focus in the recent past have been with respect to mortgagerelated practices student lending practices sales practices and related incentive compensation programs and other consumer compliance matters as well as compliance with bsaaml requirements and sanctions compliance requirements as administered by the ofac for example truist bank entered into a consent order with the fdic and the nccob in december and truist entered into a cease and desist order with the frb and nccob in january additionally during november suntrust bank entered into a consent order in with the frb current and future actions by regulators could impact truists operations see additional disclosures in the regulatory considerations section this heightened regulatory scrutiny or the results of an investigation or examination may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions there is no assurance that those actions will not result in regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against truist financial corporation truist furthermore a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the united states or in some instances regulators and other governmental officials in foreign jurisdictions federal law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators and law enforcement agencies this enforcement authority includes among other things the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties fines or restitution to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institutionaffiliated parties these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices any future enforcement action could have a material adverse impact in some cases governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements which could have significant consequences for a financial institution including loss of clients restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management practices also may be incorporated into truists confidential supervisory ratings a downgrade in these ratings or these or other regulatory actions and settlements could limit truists ability to conduct expansionary activities for a period of time and require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities in addition regulatory changes may reduce truists revenues limit the types of financial services and products it may offer alter the investments it makes affect the manner in which it operates its businesses increase its litigation and regulatory costs should it fail to appropriately comply with new or modified laws and regulatory requirements and increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products truist is subject to regulatory capital and liquidity standards that affect the companys business operations and ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders truist is subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements established by the frb and the fdic these regulatory capital and liquidity requirements are typically developed at an international level by the bcbs and then applied with adjustments in each country by the appropriate domestic regulatory bodies domestic regulatory agencies have the ability to apply stricter capital and liquidity standards than those developed by the bcbs in several instances the us banking agencies have done so with respect to us banking organizations requirements to maintain specified levels of capital and liquidity and regulatory expectations as to the quality of the companys capital and liquidity may prevent the company from taking advantage of opportunities in the best interest of shareholders or force the company to take actions contrary to their interests for example truist may be limited in its ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders in addition these requirements may impact the amount and type of loans the company is able to make truist may be constrained in its ability to expand either organically or through mergers and acquisitions these requirements may cause the company to sell or refrain from acquiring assets where the capital requirements appear inconsistent with the assets underlying risks in addition liquidity standards require the company to maintain holdings of highly liquid investments thereby reducing the companys ability to invest in less liquid assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet or interest rate risk management perspective as a category iii banking organization truist is subject to additional capital and liquidity requirements specifically truist will be subject to a supplementary leverage ratio the countercyclical capital buffer if deployed a higher outflow rate for the lcr and heightened expectations about capital planning regulatory capital and liquidity requirements receive periodic review and revision by the bcbs and the us banking agencies changes to capital and liquidity requirements may require truist or truist bank to maintain more or higher quality capital or greater liquidity and could increase some of the potential adverse effects described above the liquidity standards applicable to large us banking organizations also are expected to be supplemented in the coming years for example in may the us banking agencies proposed rules to implement the nsfr which is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable longterm funding profile in relation to their asset composition and offbalance sheet activities the us rules have not yet been finalized and more recent rule changes adjust the scope and effect of the originallyproposed us rules thus the potential impact of the nsfr remains unclear in addition to the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to truist and truist bank the companys brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements established by the sec truist financial corporation strategic and reputational risks truist is subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgages and may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers truist is required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated when selling mortgage loans or loan securitizations an increase in the number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers related to representations and warranties on loans sold could result in an increase in the amount of losses for loan repurchases truist also bears a risk of loss from borrower defaults for multifamily commercial mortgage loans sold to fnma in addition to repurchase claims from gses truist could be subject to indemnification claims from nongse purchasers of the companys loans claims could be made if truist fails to conform to statements about the quality of the mortgage loans sold the manner in which the loans were originated and underwritten or to comply with state and federal law truist may not be able to complete future mergers or acquisitions the company must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions before completing an acquisition of another bank or bhc including federal and state regulatory approvals in determining whether to approve a proposed bank or bhc acquisition bank regulators will consider among other factors the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institutions record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and protests from various stakeholders in addition us regulators must take systemic risk to the us financial system into account when evaluating whether to approve a potential acquisition transaction involving a large financial institution like truist there is no certainty as to when or if or on what terms and conditions any required regulatory approvals will be granted for any potential acquisition in specific cases truist may be required to sell banks or branches or take other actions as a condition to receiving regulatory approval an inability to satisfy other conditions necessary to consummate an acquisition transaction such as thirdparty litigation a judicial order blocking the transaction or lack of shareholder approval could also prevent the company from completing an announced acquisition truist faces risks as a servicer of loans the company acts as servicer and master servicer for mortgage loans included in securitizations and for unsecuritized mortgage loans owned by investors as a servicer or master servicer for those loans the company has certain contractual obligations to the securitization trusts investors or other third parties as a servicer truists obligations include foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or to the extent consistent with the applicable securitization or other investor agreement considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales in the companys capacity as a master servicer obligations include overseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by the servicer generally the companys servicing obligations are set by contract for which the company receives a contractual fee however gses can amend their servicing guidelines which can increase the scope or costs of the services required without any corresponding increase in the companys servicing fee further the cfpb has implemented national servicing standards which have increased the scope and costs of services which the company is required to perform in addition there has been a significant increase in state laws that impose additional servicing requirements that increase the scope and cost of the companys servicing obligations as a servicer the company also advances expenses on behalf of investors which it may be unable to collect a material breach of the companys obligations as servicer or master servicer may result in contract termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice which can generally be given by the securitization trustee or a specified percentage of security holders causing the company to lose servicing income in addition the company may be required to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses from any failure by us as a servicer or master servicer to perform the companys servicing obligations or any act or omission on the companys part that involves willful misfeasance bad faith or gross negligence for certain investors and certain transactions truist may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan the company may be subject to increased repurchase obligations as a result of claims made that the company did not satisfy its obligations as a servicer or master servicer the company may also experience increased loss severity on repurchases which may require a material increase to the companys repurchase reserve the company has and may continue to receive indemnification requests related to the companys servicing of loans owned or insured by other parties primarily gses typically such a claim seeks to impose a compensatory fee on the company for departures from gse service levels in most cases this is related to delays in the foreclosure process additionally the company has received indemnification requests where an investor or insurer has suffered a loss due to a breach of the servicing agreement while the number of such claims has been small these could increase in the future truist financial corporation truist has businesses other than banking that are subject to a variety of risks truist is a diversified financial services company and this diversity subjects the companys earnings to a broader variety of risks and uncertainties other businesses in addition to banking that the company operates include insurance investment banking securities underwriting and market making loan syndications investment management and advice and retail and wholesale brokerage services offered through the companys subsidiaries these businesses entail significant market operational credit compliance technology legal and other risks that could materially adversely impact the companys results of operations negative public opinion could damage the companys reputation and adversely impact business and revenues truists earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion negative public opinion could result from the companys actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including lending or sales practices a breach of client or teammate information the failure of any product or service sold to meet the companys clients expectations or applicable regulatory requirements corporate governance and acquisitions or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities negative public opinion could adversely affect the companys ability to attract and retain clients and personnel and can result in litigation and regulatory actions actual or alleged conduct by one of the companys businesses can result in negative public opinion about the companys other businesses actual or alleged conduct by another financial institution can result in negative public opinion about the financial services industry in general and as a result adversely affect truist scrutiny of the companys sales training and incentive compensation practices could damage the companys reputation and adversely impact business and revenues the company may face increased scrutiny of the companys consumer and other business sales practices training practices incentive compensation design and governance and quality assurance and client complaint resolution practices there can be no assurance that the companys processes and actions will meet regulatory standards or expectations findings from selfidentified or regulatory reviews may require responsive actions including increased investments in compliance systems and personnel or the payment of fines penalties increased regulatory assessments or client redress and may increase legal or reputational risk exposures competition may reduce the companys client base or cause the company to lower prices for products and services in order to maintain market share truist operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive increased competition could arise from technological legislative and regulatory changes as well as from continued consolidation there is intense competition among commercial banks in the companys market area the company also competes with other providers of financial services such as savings and loan associations credit unions consumer finance companies securities firms insurance companies commercial finance and leasing companies the mutual funds industry fullservice brokerage firms and discount brokerage firms some of which are subject to less extensive regulation than truist the companys success depends in part on the companys ability to adapt its products and services to evolving industry standards and client expectations the widespread adoption of new technologies has required and will continue to require substantial investments to modify or adapt existing products and services or to develop new products and services in addition there is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices which reduce net interest income and noninterest income from feebased products and services the company may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology or those new products may not achieve market acceptance legislative or regulatory changes also could lead to increased competition in the financial services sector if the regulatory burdens of the companys competitors are reduced relative to the requirements of the company for example egrrcpa and the tailoring rules reduce the regulatory burden of some of the companys smaller competitors which could cause some of them to become more competitive or to more aggressively pursue expansion the adoption of new technologies by competitors including internet banking services mobile applications advanced atm functionality and cryptocurrencies could require the company to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt the companys existing products and services these and other capital investments in the companys business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure the company may not be successful in introducing new products and services achieving market acceptance of new products and services anticipating or reacting to consumers changing technological preferences or developing and maintaining loyal clients truist financial corporation truist also competes with nonbank companies inside and outside of the companys market area and in some cases with companies other than those traditionally considered financial sector participants in particular technology companies are increasingly focusing on the financial sector either in partnership with competitor banking organizations or on their own these companies generally are not subject to the same regulatory burdens as financial institutions and may accordingly realize certain cost savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the client for example a number of companies offer bill pay and funds transfer services that allow clients to bypass banks technology companies are generally positioned and structured to quickly adapt to technological advances and directly focus resources on implementing those advances this competition could result in the loss of fee income client deposits and related income in addition changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect the companys operations and truist may be unable to develop competitive products and services in a timely manner as the pace of technology and change advance continuous innovation is expected to exert longterm pressure on the financial services industry truist will continually encounter technological change and must effectively develop and implement new technology the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services truist has invested in technology and connectivity to automate functions previously performed manually to facilitate the ability of clients to engage in financial transactions and otherwise to enhance the client experience with respect to the companys products and services on the retail side technological changes include developments such as more sophisticated atms and expanded access to banking transactions through the internet smart phones tablets and other remote devices truist expects to make additional investments in innovation and technology to address technological disruption in the industry and improve client offerings and service these changes allow the company to better serve the companys clients and to reduce costs the companys continued success depends in part upon the companys ability to address clients needs by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy client demands including demands for faster and more secure payment services to create efficiencies in the companys operations and to integrate those offerings with legacy platforms or to update those legacy platforms a failure to maintain or enhance the companys competitive position with respect to technology whether because of a failure to anticipate client expectations a failure in the performance of technological developments or an untimely roll out of developments may cause the company to lose market share or incur additional expense operational risks litigation may adversely affect the companys results the company is subject to litigation in the course of business claims and legal actions including supervisory actions by the companys regulators could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs the outcome of litigation and regulatory matters as well as the timing of ultimate resolution are inherently difficult to predict actual legal and other costs of resolving claims may be greater than the companys legal reserves the ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding depending on the remedy sought and granted could materially adversely affect the companys results of operations and financial condition in addition governmental authorities have at times sought criminal penalties against companies in the financial services sector for violations and at times have required an admission of wrongdoing from financial institutions in connection with resolving such matters criminal convictions or admissions of wrongdoing in a settlement with the government can lead to greater exposure in civil litigation and reputational harm substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against the company could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm which adversely impact the companys business prospects further the company may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities which could adversely affect the companys results of operations and financial condition the company may incur fines penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations including inadvertent or unintentional violations truist maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure that it complies with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that these will be effective in addition to fines and penalties the company may suffer other negative consequences from regulatory violations including restrictions on certain activities such as the companys mortgage business which may affect the companys relationship with the gses and may also damage the companys reputation and this in turn might materially affect the companys business and results of operations truist financial corporation further some legal frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even when the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even when there were systems and procedures in place designed to ensure compliance for example truist is subject to regulations issued by ofac that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and designated nationals of those countries ofac may impose penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations courts may uphold significant additional penalties on financial institutions even where the financial institution had already reimbursed the government or other counterparties for actual losses truist relies on other companies to provide key components of the companys business infrastructure third parties provide key components of the companys business infrastructure such as banking services data processing business processes internet connections and network access any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the companys ability to deliver products and services to clients to support teammates and otherwise to conduct business technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the companys business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party further in some instances the company may be responsible for failures of such third parties to comply with government regulations the company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions failures in the companys business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business truist depends on the expertise of key personnel if these individuals leave or change their roles without effective replacements operations may suffer the companys success depends to a large degree on the continued services of executive officers and other key personnel who have extensive experience in the industry the companys business could be adversely impacted from the loss of key persons or failure to manage a smooth transition to new personnel these risks may be exacerbated as the company continues to integrate processes and systems subsequent to the merger the company may not be able to hire or retain additional qualified personnel and recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of changes in the marketplace which may increase costs and adversely impact the companys ability to implement business strategies the companys success depends upon the ability to attract and retain highly motivated wellqualified personnel the company faces significant competition in the recruitment of qualified employees the companys ability to execute the companys business strategy and provide high quality service may suffer if the company is unable to recruit or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees or if the costs of employee compensation or benefits increase substantially the us banking agencies have jointly issued comprehensive guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging employees to take imprudent risks this guidance significantly affects the amount form and context of incentive compensation to teammates the frb fdic sec and other federal regulatory agencies have jointly proposed rules which would affect incentive compensation these rules which have been pending for several years if finalized may result in additional costs and restrictions on the form of the companys incentive compensation the companys framework for managing risks may not be effective the companys risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss truist has established policies processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor report and analyze the types of risk to which the company is subject including liquidity credit market operational technology reputational legal model and compliance risk among others however the companys risk management measures may not be fully effective in identifying and mitigating the companys risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated even if the models for assessing risk are properly designed and implemented some of the companys methods of managing risk are based upon the companys use of observed historical market behavior and managements judgment these methods may not accurately predict future exposures which could be significantly greater than historical measures indicate if the companys risk management framework proves ineffective it could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected truist financial corporation there are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in truists business which may impact decisions made by management and regulators truist relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting or estimating losses assessing capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that truists business decisions based on information incorporating model output would be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information also information truist provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading some of the decisions that the regulators make including those related to capital distributions to truists shareholders could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient the company is at risk of increased losses from fraud criminals committing fraud increasingly are using more sophisticated techniques and in some cases are a part of larger criminal organizations which allow them to be more effective fraudulent activity has taken many forms and escalates as more tools for accessing financial services emerge such as realtime payments fraud schemes including occurrences of employee fraud information theft or other malfeasance are broad and continuously evolving and include such things as debit cardcredit card fraud check fraud mechanical devices attached to atm machines social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information or impersonation of the companys clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials in addition individuals or business entities may properly identify themselves yet seek to establish a business relationship for the purpose of perpetrating fraud increased deployment of technologies such as chip card technology defray and reduce aspects of fraud however criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information such as unaffiliated healthcare providers and government entities in order to impersonate the consumer to commit fraud further as a result of the increased sophistication of fraud activity the company has increased the companys spending on systems resources and controls to detect and prevent fraud as well as increased spending to provide certain credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to the companys consumer clients this will result in continued ongoing investments in the future the companys operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could fail or be breached which could disrupt the companys business and adversely impact the companys results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout the companys business and as a result of the companys interactions with and reliance on third parties is not limited to the companys own internal operational functions the companys operational and security systems and infrastructure including computer systems data management and internal processes as well as those of third parties are integral to the companys performance truist relies on its teammates and third parties in the companys operations who may expose the company to risk as a result of human error misconduct malfeasance or failure or breach of systems and infrastructure including that of third parties for example the companys ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions including to third parties with whom the company interacts with or relies upon the company faces security risks including denial of service attacks hacking and social engineering attacks attacks targeting the companys teammates and clients malware intrusion or data corruption attempts and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information adversely affect the companys business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure the companys computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties are subject to security risks and susceptible to cyberattacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft the companys business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in the companys computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access the companys network products and services the companys clients and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of the companys network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks truist and truists clients regulators and other third parties including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks cyberattacks are designed to expose security vulnerabilities in the companys systems or the systems of third parties or other security measures that could result in the unauthorized gathering monitoring misuse release loss or destruction of confidential proprietary or sensitive information a cyberattack could also damage the companys systems by introducing material disruptions to the companys or the companys clients or other third parties truist financial corporation network access or business operations as cyber threats continue to evolve the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance the companys protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of the companys systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures the company may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may the company be able to implement sufficient preventive measures against such security breaches which may result in material losses or consequences to truist cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions for example cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as truist continues to expand its mobilepayment and internetbased product offerings and expand the companys internal usage of webbased products and applications in addition cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates terrorist organizations hostile foreign governments disgruntled employees or vendors activists and other external parties including those involved in corporate espionage even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise targeted social engineering attacks and spear phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent in such an attack an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce teammates clients or other users of the companys systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the companys data or that of the companys clients persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources time and motive the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred the risk of a security breach caused by a cyberattack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years in addition the existence of cyberattacks or security breaches at thirdparty vendors with access to the companys data may not be disclosed in a timely manner the company also faces indirect technology cybersecurity and other operational risks relating to clients and other third parties that the company relies upon to facilitate or enable business activities including financial counterparties regulators and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power in addition truist faces cybersecurity and other operational risks relating to the merger including increased phishing attacks on teammates increased network perimeter scanning by third parties searching for vulnerabilities and domain name squatting further as a result of increasing consolidation interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyberattack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants this consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure on both individual and industrywide bases as disparate systems need to be integrated often on an accelerated basis any thirdparty technology failure cyberattack other information or security breach termination or constraint could among other things adversely affect the companys ability to conduct transactions service the companys clients manage the companys exposure to risk or expand the companys business cyberattacks or other information or security breaches including those directed at third parties may result in a material loss or have material consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyberattack on the companys systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage the companys reputation with clients and third parties with whom the company does business hacking of personal information and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause serious negative consequences including loss of clients and business opportunities costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach significant disruption to the companys operations and business misappropriation exposure or destruction of the companys confidential information intellectual property funds and those of the companys clients or damage to the companys or the companys clients or third parties computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws this could result in litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties loss of confidence in the companys security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs which could adversely impact the companys results of operations liquidity and financial condition in addition the company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event natural disasters and other catastrophic events could have a material adverse impact on the companys operations or the companys financial condition and results the occurrence of catastrophic weather events or pandemics could adversely affect the companys financial condition or results of operations truist has significant operations and clients along the gulf and atlantic coasts as well as other regions of the us which could be adversely impacted by hurricanes tornadoes and other severe weather in those areas natural and other types of disasters could have an adverse impact on truists businesses in that such events could materially disrupt the companys operations or the ability or willingness of the companys clients to access the financial services offered including adverse impacts on the companys borrowers to timely repay their loans and the value of any collateral held these events could reduce the companys earnings and cause volatility in the companys financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations truist financial corporation in addition certain commercial and corporate borrowers may be affected by the recent outbreak of the coronavirus which originated in wuhan hubei province china but has been reported in other countries these effects could include disruptions or restrictions in clients supply chains closures of clients facilities or decreases in demand for clients products and services if clients are adversely affected or if the virus leads to a widespread health crisis that impacts economic growth truists financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected despite having no direct operations in china although truist has business continuity plans and other safeguards in place the companys operations and communications may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events and there can be no assurance that such business continuity plans will be effective truist may be impacted by the soundness of other financial institutions the companys ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty and other relationships truist has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers central counterparties commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional investors and clients as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally in the past have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by truist or by other institutions many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of default of the companys counterparty or client in addition the companys credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by truist cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the companys exposure any such losses could materially and adversely affect the companys results of operations and financial condition truist depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties truist relies on the completeness and accuracy of representations made by and information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties including financial statements and other financial information if the information provided is not accurate or complete the companys decisions about extending credit or entering into other transactions with clients or counterparties could be adversely affected and the company could suffer defaults credit losses or other negative consequences as a result the companys accounting policies and processes are critical to how it reports the companys financial condition and results of operations they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how the company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the companys assets or liabilities and financial results several of the companys accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions pursuant to us gaap the company makes certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the companys financial statements including in determining credit loss reserves reserves related to litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities including amounts related to assets acquired liabilities assumed and the value of goodwill among other items if assumptions or estimates underlying the companys financial statements are incorrect or are adjusted periodically the company may experience material losses management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets liabilities commitments and contingencies a variety of factors could affect the realization of income and expense or the recognition of assets and liabilities in the companys financial statements truist has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently in addition the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner due to the uncertainty surrounding the companys judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters the company cannot guarantee that adjustments to accounting policies or restatement of prior period financial statements will not be required further from time to time the fasb and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the companys financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond the companys control can be hard to predict and could materially affect how the company reports its financial results and condition in some cases the company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements truist financial corporation for example in june the fasb issued an accounting standard related to credit losses cecl the standard requires companies to record at the time of origination credit losses expected throughout the life of certain financial assets such as loans and unfunded commitments as opposed to the current practice of recording losses when it is probable that a loss event has occurred truist adopted the credit loss standard on january and recognized a onetime cumulative effect adjustment to the companys allowance for credit losses and retained earnings on that date depressed market values for the companys stock and adverse economic conditions sustained over a period of time may require the company to write down all or some portion of the companys goodwill goodwill is periodically tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount if the fair value is greater than the carrying amount then the reporting units goodwill is deemed not to be impaired the fair value of a reporting unit is impacted by the reporting units expected financial performance and susceptibility to adverse economic regulatory and legislative changes the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units are assessed for reasonableness by reviewing a variety of indicators including comparing these estimated fair values to the companys market capitalization over a reasonable period of time while this comparison provides some relative market information about the estimated fair value of the reporting units it is not determinative and needs to be evaluated in the context of the current economic environment however significant and sustained declines in the companys market capitalization could be an indication of potential goodwill impairment certain banking laws and certain provisions of the companys articles of incorporation may have an antitakeover effect provisions of federal banking laws including regulatory approval requirements could make it difficult for a third party to acquire the company even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the companys owners acquisition of certain amounts of any class of voting stock of a bhc or depository institution including shares of the companys common stock may create a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer controls the bhc or depository institution and thus unless the acquirer is able to rebut this presumption it would be subject to various laws and regulations applicable to bhc also a bhc must obtain the prior approval of the frb before among other things acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank including truist bank there also are provisions in the companys amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws such as limitations on the ability to call a special meeting of the companys shareholders that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt in addition the companys board will be authorized under the companys amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue shares of the companys preferred stock and to determine the rights terms conditions and privileges of such preferred stock without shareholder approval these provisions may effectively inhibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination
