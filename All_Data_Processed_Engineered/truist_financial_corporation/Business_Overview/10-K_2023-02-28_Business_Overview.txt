and insurance companies the ability of nonbanking entities including financial technology companies to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has increased competition nonbanking entities are not subject to the same regulatory framework as banks and bhcs and therefore can often operate with greater flexibility and lower costs in addition the ability to access and use

criteria regulatory considerations the regulatory framework applicable to banking organizations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the stability of the us financial system rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors in addition to banking laws and regulations truist is subject to various other laws and regulations all of which directly or indirectly affect the operations and management of truist and its ability to make distributions to shareholders truist and its subsidiaries are also subject to supervision and examination by multiple regulators banking and other financial services statutes regulations and policies are continually under review by congress state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies in addition to laws and regulations state and federal bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to truist and its subsidiaries any change in the statutes regulations or regulatory policies applicable to truist including changes in their interpretation or implementation could have a material effect on its business or organization truist financial corporation the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which truist is subject have increased in recent years initially in response to the financial crisis and more recently in light of other factors including technological factors market changes climate change concerns as well as increased scrutiny and possible denials of bank mergers and acquisitions by federal bank regulators regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector truist expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision the descriptions below summarize certain significant federal and state laws to which truist is subject these descriptions do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statues or regulatory provisions general as a bhc truist is subject to regulation under the bhca and to regulation examination and supervision by the frb truist bank a north carolina statechartered commercial bank that is not a member of the federal reserve system is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the nccob and the fdic truist bank and its affiliates are also subject to examination by the cfpb for compliance with most federal consumer financial protection laws truist and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates including those that engage in derivatives transactions securities underwriting market making brokerage investment advisory and insurance activities are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations as well as supervision and examination by other federal and state regulatory agencies and other regulatory authorities including the sec cftc finra and nfa truist bank is also subject to additional state and federal laws as well as various compliance regulations that govern its activities the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower examinations by truists regulators consider not only compliance with applicable laws regulations and supervisory policies of the agency but also capital levels asset quality risk management effectiveness the ability and performance of management and the board of directors the effectiveness of internal controls earnings liquidity and various other factors following those examinations truist and truist bank are assigned supervisory ratings this supervisory framework including the examination reports and supervisory ratings which are considered confidential supervisory information could materially impact the conduct growth and profitability of truists operations under the frbs large financial institution rating system component ratings are assigned for capital planning liquidity risk management and governance and controls to be considered well managed under this rating system a firm must be rated broadly meets expectations or conditionally meets expectations for each of its three component ratings the results of examinations by any of truists federal bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant limitations on truists activities and growth these regulatory agencies generally have broad enforcement authority and discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements against a regulated entity where the relevant agency determines that the operations of the regulated entity or any of its subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations are conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner or represent an unfair deceptive or abusive act or practice fhc regulation truist has elected to be treated as an fhc which allows it to engage in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permissible for a bhc including activities that are financial in nature or incidental thereto such as securities underwriting or merchant banking while fhcs may engage in certain acquisitions without prior approval of the frb any acquisition over billion in assets would require prior approval by the frb in order to maintain its status as an fhc truist and its affiliated idi must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged and truist bank must have at least a satisfactory cra rating if the frb determines that a fhc is not wellcapitalized or wellmanaged the frb may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the fhc and may place limitations on its ability to conduct certain business activities that fhcs are generally permitted to conduct and its ability to make certain acquisitions if the failure to meet these standards persists a fhc may be required to divest its idi subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bhcs that are not fhcs furthermore if an idi subsidiary of a fhc has not maintained a satisfactory cra rating the fhc would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities although the fhc would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities longstanding federal regulations require a fhc to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks in times of severe financial stress the obligation to serve as a source of strength could cause truist to commit significant resources to supporting truist bank that otherwise would be available to truists creditors and shareholders truist financial corporation resolution planning as a category iii banking organization truist is required to submit to the frb and fdic a resolution plan every three years with submissions alternating between a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan the frb and the fdic must review and evaluate truists resolution plan the frb and fdic are authorized to impose restrictions on growth and activities or operations if the agencies determine that a resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution of the company under the us bankruptcy code and could require the banking organization to divest assets or take other actions if it did not submit an acceptable resolution plan within two years after any such restrictions were imposed truist submitted its inaugural resolution plan to the frb and fdic in september on september the frb and fdic announced that they did not identify any shortcomings or deficiencies in truists resolution plan on the same date the frb and fdic also announced that they intend to issue guidance to assist category ii and category iii banking organizations in further developing their resolution plans in advance of the next round of resolution plans due on july in addition truist bank as an idi is required by fdic regulation to file a separate bank level resolution plan every three years the fdic issued a policy statement in june announcing that it will resume requiring bank level resolution plans for large banks including truist bank and that such banklevel resolution plans will have more streamlined content requirements than previous requirements during truist bank was informed by the fdic that its next resolution plan was due on or before december truist bank submitted its inaugural idi resolution plan to the fdic in november which is currently under review enhanced prudential standards and regulatory tailoring rules certain us bhcs including truist are subject to enhanced prudential standards as such truist is subject to more stringent liquidity and capital requirements leverage limits stress testing singlecounterparty credit limits resolution planning and risk management standards than those applicable to smaller institutions certain larger banking organizations are subject to additional enhanced prudential standards under the tailoring rules truist is subject to the standards applicable to category iii banking organizations which generally include bhcs with greater than billion but less than billion in total consolidated assets and less than billion in certain riskrelated exposures capital requirements truist and truist bank are subject to certain riskbased and leverage capital ratio requirements established by the frb for truist and by the fdic for truist bank these requirements are based on the capital framework developed by the bcbs for strengthening the regulation supervision and risk management of banks under basel iii rules as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act these quantitative calculations are minimums and the frb and fdic may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner failure to be well capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have an adverse material effect on truists operations or financial condition these actions could include requiring truist to commit capital to truist bank in abnormal operating conditions which would otherwise be available to truists creditors and shareholders failure to be well capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on truists or truist banks ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval for acquisitions under the regulatory capital rules truists and truist banks assets exposures and certain offbalance sheet items are subject to risk weights under the standardized approach used to determine the institutions riskweighted assets these riskweighted assets are used to calculate the following minimum capital ratios for truist and truist bank cet1 riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of cet1 capital to riskweighted assets cet1 capital primarily includes common shareholders equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions including with respect to goodwill intangible assets certain deferred tax assets and aoci tier riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of tier capital to riskweighted assets tier capital is primarily comprised of cet1 capital perpetual preferred stock and certain qualifying capital instruments total riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of total capital including cet1 capital tier capital and tier capital to riskweighted assets tier capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying alll tier capital also includes among other things certain trust preferred securities truist financial corporation under the frbs capital framework for bhcs truist is subject to capital requirements including the scb that are determined from the supervisory stress test results the scb is equal to the greater of i the difference between truists starting and minimum projected cet1 capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test plus the sum of the dollar amount of its planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of riskweighted assets or ii the frb assigned truist an scb of which is effective from october to september at which point a revised scb will be calculated and provided to truist truist is required to describe its planned capital actions in its ccar capital plan but is no longer required to seek prior approval if it makes capital distributions in excess of those included in its ccar capital plan instead truist is subject to automatic distribution limitations if its capital ratios fall below its buffer requirements which include the scb for certain large banking organizations the scb could be supplemented by a countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional of riskweighted assets this buffer is currently set at zero an frb policy statement establishes the framework and factors the frb would use in setting and adjusting the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer covered banking organizations would generally have months after the announcement of any increase in the countercyclical capital buffer to meet the increased buffer requirement unless the frb determines to establish an earlier effective date if the full countercyclical buffer amount is implemented truist and truist bank would be required to maintain a cet1 capital ratio of at least a tier capital ratio of at least and a total capital ratio of at least to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments certain large banking organizations with trading assets and liabilities above certain thresholds including truist are subject to the market risk rule and must adjust their riskbased capital ratios to reflect the market risk of their trading activities refer to the market risk section of the mda for additional disclosures related to market risk management truist and truist bank are subject to a tier leverage ratio equal to the ratio of tier capital to quarterly average assets net of goodwill certain other intangible assets and certain other deductions category iii banking organizations are also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio the supplementary leverage ratio is calculated by dividing tier capital by total leverage exposure which takes into account onbalance sheet assets as well as certain offbalance sheet items including loan commitments and potential future exposure of derivative contracts the frb has not yet revised the wellcapitalized standard for bhcs to reflect capital requirements imposed under the basel iii rules for purposes of certain frb rules including determining whether a bhc meets the requirements to be a fhc bhcs such as truist must maintain a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater to meet the wellcapitalized minimum the frb may require bhcs including truist to maintain capital ratios in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bhcs particular condition risk profile and growth plans in september the frb fdic and occ announced that they are developing a joint proposed rule to implement enhanced regulatory capital standards that align with those included in the basel iii rules and plan to seek public input on the new capital standards as soon as possible refer to the capital section in mda for disclosures containing the minimum regulatory capital ratios and wellcapitalized minimum ratios applicable to category iii banking organizations in the us banking agencies adopted a final rule that permitted banking organizations to elect to delay temporarily the implementation of cecl until january and subsequently to phase in the effects of cecl on regulatory capital through january which truist elected to use under the fiveyear transition truist deferred for two years of the dayone effect of adopting cecl and of the cumulative increase or decrease in the allowance for credit losses since adoption of cecl following the first two years truist began to phase in the aggregate capital effects over the next three years consistent with the transition in the original threeyear transition rule capital planning and stress testing requirements in addition to the regulatory capital requirements under the frbs ccar process truist must submit an annual capital plan to the frb that reflects its projected financial performance under hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios including a supervisory severely adverse scenario provided by the frb the frbs ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework also require bhcs subject to category iii standards such as truist to conduct companyrun stress tests and submit to supervisory stress tests conducted by the frb the companyrun stress tests employ stress scenarios provided by the frb and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distribution assumptions across large us bhcs in addition truist is required to conduct annual stress tests using internallydeveloped scenarios intended to stress the unique risk profile of the institution the frb also conducts ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests employing internal supervisory models on the supervisory stress scenarios as a category iii banking organization truist is subject to supervisory stress testing on an annual basis and companyrun stress testing on a biennial basis truist financial corporation truist is required to submit its next capital plan and the results of its own stress tests to the frb by april the frb is required to announce the results of its supervisory stress tests by june in addition to the ccar stress testing for

are subject to a minimum lcr the lcr is designed to ensure that bhcs have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for calendar days truist also is subject to frb rules that require certain large bhcs to conduct internal liquidity stress tests over a range of time horizons maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net outflows under the bhcs 30day liquidity stress test and maintain a contingency funding plan that meets certain requirements in july truist became subject to final rules implementing the nsfr which are designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable longterm funding profile in relation to their asset composition and offbalance sheet activities the nsfr calculated as the ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding must exceed available stable funding represents a weighted measure of a companys funding sources over a oneyear time horizon calculated by applying standardized weightings to the companys equity and liabilities based on their expected stability required stable funding is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics as a category iii banking organization truist and truist bank are subject to an nsfr requirement equal to of the full requirement payment of dividends the parent company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries and it depends in part upon dividends received from its direct and indirect subsidiaries including truist bank to fund its activities including its ability to make capital distributions such as paying dividends or repurchasing shares under federal law there are various limitations on the extent to which truist bank can declare and pay dividends to the parent company including those related to regulatory capital requirements general regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices and federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits surplus and available earnings certain contractual restrictions also may limit the ability of truist bank to pay dividends to the parent company no assurances can be given that truist bank will in any circumstances pay dividends to the parent company the parent companys ability to declare and pay dividends is similarly limited by federal banking law and frb regulations and policy the frb has authority to prohibit bhcs from making capital distributions if they would be deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice the frb has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bhcs to pay dividends unless a bhcs net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organizations capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition in addition the parent companys ability to make capital distributions including paying dividends and repurchasing capital securities is subject to the frbs automatic restrictions on capital distributions under the frbs capital rules truists riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements are discussed above in the capital requirements section north carolina law provides that as long as a bank does not make distributions that reduce its capital below its applicable required capital the board of directors of a bank chartered under the laws of north carolina may declare such distributions as the directors deem proper prompt corrective action the federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action with respect to fdicinsured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements the law establishes five categories for this purpose wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized to be considered wellcapitalized an idi must maintain minimum capital ratios and must not be subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure an institution that fails to remain wellcapitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the regulations apply only to banks and not to bhcs however the frb is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding companys subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bhc in its capacity as a source of strength would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiarys capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments truist financial corporation in addition failure to meet capital requirements may cause an institution to be directed to raise additional capital federal law further mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards generally relating to operations and management asset quality and executive compensation and authorizes administrative action against an institution that fails to meet such standards failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and under certain conditions the appointment of a conservator or

acquire ownership or control of more than of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bhc or bank or merge or consolidate with another bhc without the prior approval of the frb the bhca and other federal laws enumerate the factors the frb must consider when reviewing the merger of bhcs the acquisition of banks or the acquisition of voting securities of a bank or bhc these factors include the competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved in the transaction the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the united states the organizations compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and the records of performance under the cra of the idis involved in the transaction federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and bhcs without geographic limitation and a bank headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in another state subject to market share limitations regulatory approvals and any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of time the market share limitations impose conditions that the acquiring bhc after and as a result of the acquisition control no more than of the total amount of deposits of idis in the us and no more than subject to variation by state law of such deposits in applicable states frb rules also prohibit a

ownership type the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system that determines assessment rates for an idi based on an assessment rate calculator which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each idi poses to the dif the assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity as defined under the doddfrank act the assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the fdic subject to certain limits under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly the fdic as required under the federal deposit insurance act established a plan in september to restore the dif reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of within eight years this plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate based on the fdics recent projections however the fdic determined that the dif reserve ratio is at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of september without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rates in october the fdic adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by basis points beginning on january this rule is expected to increase truists regulatory premiums by approximately million annually the fdic also concurrently maintained the designated reserve ratio for the dif at consumer
