requirements against a regulated entity where the relevant agency determines that the operations of the regulated entity or any of its subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable law or regulations are conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner or represent an unfair or deceptive act or practice truist financial corporation fhc regulation truist has elected to be treated as a fhc which allows it to engage in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permissible for a bhc including activities that are financial in nature or incidental thereto such as securities underwriting or merchant banking in order to maintain its status as a fhc truist and its affiliated idi must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged and truist bank must have at least a satisfactory cra rating if the frb determines that a fhc is not wellcapitalized or wellmanaged the frb may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the fhc and may place limitations on its ability to conduct certain business activities that fhcs are generally permitted to conduct and its ability to make certain acquisitions if the failure to meet these standards persists a fhc may be required to divest its idi subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bhcs that are not fhcs furthermore if an idi subsidiary of a fhc has not maintained a satisfactory cra rating the fhc would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities although the fhc would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities enhanced prudential standards and regulatory tailoring rules certain us bhcs including truist are subject to enhanced prudential standards as such truist is subject to more stringent liquidity and capital requirements leverage limits stress testing resolution planning and risk management standards than those applicable to smaller institutions certain larger banking organizations are subject to additional enhanced prudential standards truist became subject to the frbs singlecounterparty credit limit rule as of july and is subject to a limit of of tier capital for aggregate net credit exposures including exposure resulting from among other transactions extensions of credit repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions investments in securities and derivative transactions to any other unaffiliated counterparty under the tailoring rules truist is subject to the standards applicable to category iii banking organizations which generally include bank holding companies with greater than billion but less than billion in total consolidated assets and less than billion in certain riskrelated exposures resolution planning as a category iii banking organization truist will be required to submit a resolution plan every three years with the first resolution plan under the new rule to be submitted by september later resolution plans under this rule will alternate between full resolution plans and targeted resolution plans the frb and the fdic must review and evaluate truists resolution plan the frb and fdic are authorized to impose restrictions on growth and activities or operations if the agencies determine that a resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate a rapid and orderly resolution of the company under the us bankruptcy code and could require the banking organization to divest assets or take other actions if it did not submit an acceptable resolution plan within two years after any such restrictions were imposed in addition truist bank is required by an fdic regulation to file a separate bank level resolution plan in april the fdic issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking that would modify the content and frequency of resolution planning requirements for systemically important idis while this proposal did not include specific details regarding the content or frequency of future bank level resolution planning requirements the fdic indicated that the revised approach would establish tiered resolution planning requirements based on the size complexity and other factors of applicable idis on january the fdic lifted a moratorium from november that delayed the next round of submissions of resolution plans for idis until this rulemaking process has been completed the fdic has indicated that firms will not be required to submit a resolution plan without at least months advance notice as truist bank has not received any written notice regarding its next resolution plan submission it does not currently have an anticipated submission date for a resolution plan capital requirements truist and truist bank are subject to certain riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements established by the frb for truist and by the fdic for truist bank these requirements are based on the capital framework developed by the bcbs for strengthening the regulation supervision and risk management of banks under basel iii rules as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act these quantitative calculations are minimums and the frb and fdic may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner failure to be well capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have an adverse material effect on truists operations or financial condition failure to be well capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on truists or truist banks ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications truist financial corporation in october the federal banking regulators adopted rules that revised the criteria for determining the applicability of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements for large united states banking organizations including truist and truist bank and that tailored the application of the frbs enhanced prudential standards to large banking organizations under these rules truist and truist bank are subject to the standards applicable to category iii banking organizations under the regulatory capital rules truists and truist banks assets exposures and certain offbalance sheet items are subject to risk weights used to determine the institutions riskweighted assets these riskweighted assets are used to calculate the following minimum capital ratios for truist and truist bank cet1 riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of cet1 capital to riskweighted assets cet1 capital primarily includes common shareholders equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions including with respect to goodwill intangible assets certain deferred tax assets and aoci tier riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of tier capital to riskweighted assets tier capital is primarily comprised of cet1 capital perpetual preferred stock and certain qualifying capital instruments total riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of total capital including cet1 capital tier capital and tier capital to riskweighted assets tier capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying alll tier capital also includes among other things certain trust preferred securities in march the frb adopted a final rule that integrates its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with existing regulatory capital requirements for riskbased capital requirements for certain large bhcs including truist the scb replaced the capital conservation buffer which was required in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions including dividends and repurchases of any tier capital instrument such as common and qualifying preferred stock and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments the capital conservation buffer was through september beginning in the ccar cycle the frb will notify truist of its scb requirements which is equal to the greater of i the difference between its starting and minimum projected cet1 capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test plus the sum of the dollar amount of truists planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of riskweighted assets or ii the frb assigned truist an scb of which is effective from october through september although the final rule continues to require that the firm describe its planned capital distributions in its ccar capital plan truist is no longer required to seek prior approval if it makes capital distributions in excess of those included in its ccar capital plan instead truist is subject to automatic distribution limitations if its capital ratios fall below its buffer requirements which include the scb for certain large banking organizations the scb could be supplemented by a countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional of riskweighted assets this buffer is currently set at zero an frb policy statement establishes the framework and factors the frb would use in setting and adjusting the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer covered banking organizations would generally have months after the announcement of any increase in the countercyclical capital buffer to meet the increased buffer requirement unless the frb determines to establish an earlier effective date if the full countercyclical buffer amount is implemented truist would be required to maintain a cet1 capital ratio of at least a tier capital ratio of at least and a total capital ratio of at least and truist bank would be required to maintain a cet1 capital ratio of at least a tier capital ratio of at least and a total capital ratio of at least to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments certain large banking organizations with trading assets and liabilities above certain thresholds including truist are subject to the market risk rule and must adjust their riskbased capital ratios to reflect the market risk of their trading activities refer to the market risk section of the mda for additional disclosures related to market risk management in addition truist and truist bank are subject to a tier leverage ratio equal to the ratio of tier capital to quarterly average assets net of goodwill certain other intangible assets and certain other deductions category iii banking organizations are also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio the supplementary leverage ratio is calculated by dividing tier capital by total leverage exposure which takes into account onbalance sheet assets as well as certain offbalance sheet items including loan commitments and potential future exposure of derivative contracts in response to the covid19 pandemic the frb adopted an interim final rule that temporarily changes the supplementary leverage ratio to exclude us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the calculation of a firms leverage exposure the interim final rule applies to bhcs the interim final rule became effective april and will remain in effect through march while a similar rule providing relief to idis was issued truist bank has elected not to take advantage of this provision for truist bank truist financial corporation the total minimum regulatory capital ratios and wellcapitalized minimum ratios applicable to category iii banking organizations are reflected in the table below the frb has not yet revised the wellcapitalized standard for bhcs to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the basel iii rules for purposes of certain frb rules including determining whether a bhc meets the requirements to be a fhc bhcs such as truist must maintain a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater the frb may require bhcs including truist to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bhcs particular condition risk profile and growth plans

points for truist bank in the us banking agencies adopted a final rule that permits banking organizations that implement cecl before the end of to elect to follow the threeyear transition available under the prior rule or a new fiveyear transition to phase in the effects of cecl on regulatory capital under the fiveyear transition the banking organization would defer for two years of the dayone effect of adopting cecl and of the cumulative increase in the allowance for credit losses since adoption of cecl following the first two years the electing organization will phase out the aggregate capital effects over the next three years consistent with the transition in the original threeyear transition rule truist has elected to use the fiveyear transition to phase in the impacts of cecl on regulatory capital the us banking agencies have adopted a final rule altering the definition of eligible retained income under the final rule eligible retained income is the greater of a firms i net income for the four preceding calendar quarters net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income and ii average net income over the preceding four quarters this definition applies with respect to all of truists capital requirements capital planning and stress testing requirements in addition to the regulatory capital requirements under the frbs ccar process truist must submit an annual capital plan to the frb that reflects its projected financial performance under hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios including a supervisory severely adverse scenario provided by the frb the frbs ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework also require bhcs subject to category iii standards such as truist to conduct companyrun stress tests and

to suspend share repurchases cap common dividends per share to the amount paid in the second quarter and further limit dividends according to a formula based on recent income the frb also required all large banks to resubmit and update their capital plans based on instructions and scenarios provided by the frb in december following a second round of stress testing based on the required capital plan resubmissions the frb modified these restrictions for the first quarter of to permit share repurchases and dividends according to a formula based on the average of the firms net income for the four

ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable longterm funding profile in relation to their asset composition and offbalance sheet activities the nsfr calculated as the ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding must exceed available stable funding represents a weighted measure of a companys funding sources over a oneyear time horizon calculated by applying standardized weightings to the companys equity and liabilities based on their expected stability required stable funding is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets derivatives exposures and
