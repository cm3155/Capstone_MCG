call and i hope you and your family are doing well now i would say relative to the challenges that were all facing were really happy to report what i call a great quarter strong balance sheet particularly in asset quality liquidity and capital relatively strong earnings great value proposition for our clients particularly in our digital offerings great team which i am extraordinarily proud of and a strong commitment to our communities and other stakeholders we are as you know from our previous conversation really focused on our culture especially our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities and im going to show on slide a few of the things were doing to live out our purpose so we announced recently something were very excited about a million donation to help establish an organization called cornersquare community capital this is a new organization that will be focusing on funding to racially and ethnically diverse small business owners women and individuals in lmi communities this will be done through cdfis community development financial institutions and its a very exciting opportunity to get funds exactly where theyre needed were really proud of our first truist csr report i hope youve had a chance to read it we launched recently our truist momentum which is continuation of a suntrust program that focuses on financial wellbeing we partnered with everfi to introduce this is something were very excited about a game called word force which helps kids in k2 learn how to read you heard me say in the past unfortunately in our country today twothirds of the kids in the public school system into third grade cannot read this is the way of getting at that it may not be the ph allin answer but its a really good start were excited about it were in our beta test but we already have over students in over schools participating we are doing a really good job in terms of conservation of energy water and making good progress on a number of areas like that investing in those areas to make our climate and our environment better we did as you know announced as a part of merger a billion community benefits plan over the next three years were very excited about that and you can see on the slide a number of areas that were really committed to i would particularly point out that we will be investing in loans andor investments of billion over these next three years in home purchase mortgage loans and to lmi and minority borrowers so this is a big part of helping to deal with some of the social injustice and racial inequity problems that we have in our country and a number of other programs that you can see there i would also point out that we are committed at the executive level to improving our diversity we said in our csr report that we have committed over the next three years to improve our senior leadership diversity from in to you can see there that we have a very good and effective diverse board with being women and minorities so we feel really good about that i would also point out we were honored to receive a perfect truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 score of on the human rights campaign foundations corporate equality index so were doing a really good job with regard to living our purpose if you look at slide id just point out a few highlights we did have taxable equivalent revenue of billion net income available to our common shareholders of billion but adjusted net income available to common was billion that resulted in diluting earnings per share on adjusted of return on average tangible common equity adjusted was very strong and a really good efficiency ratio adjusted at we were really pleased about our nonperforming assets at and we recognize that theres more to come with regard to credit quality deterioration depending on what happens with regard to the economy but still given where we are today and recognizing there are some positive impacts with regard to accommodations there thats a really good number we feel really good about that and likewise our net chargeoffs were at the low end of what we had talked about were very pleased with our common equity tier is now at so we feel really good about our capital position if you look at some selected items on slide id just point out we did have security gains of million which was a positive per share we had merger and restructuring charges of million which was we did have incremental operating expenses related to the merger remember these are expenses that dont qualify for ph merc in terms of calling out because they do have future benefits but theyre not a part of our longerterm run rate that was million and that was and we did make a million unusual contribution to our charitable foundation and that was so if you put all that together it was a negative impact to eps of about so we feel good about the adjusted number because of the quality of the selected items ph onto slide just a couple of comments with regard to loans as you all know loans are a real challenge for us and for the industry now because of whats going on in the economy of course we did see a big run up in loans in the second quarter and likewise we saw a big run down in loans in the third as a large number of the corporate line drawdowns were repaid so we saw total loan reductions of billion and billion of that was into ci area so thats principally what happened we did have some bright spots we had growth in lightstream our national consumer digital platform sheffield had a growth recreational lending prime auto we did have some decreases in some other consumer areas like resi mortgage and so forth so it was kind of mixed bag with regard to consumer but overall the big story in loans is if you exclude the run up in balances in the second and the run down in the third ph growth was flat i would say to you that we do expect future headwinds with regard to the ppp loans we have about billion there thatll begin to pay off as we head into the fourth and the first and probably the second loan growth is really challenging now obviously banks are a reflection of the economy and so we should not be surprised about that the real question is whats going to happen to the economy i would just point out and this is just one persons opinion its important to look back at previous corrections that weve had and theres virtually always a material precipitating event so in we had the commercial real estate bubble we had the technology bubble we had the residential real estate bubble but this one didnt have a bubble this was a very strong 10year economy unemployment rate we just shut it down appropriately so for medical reasons but we shut it down i made that point to say that if this pandemic doesnt go on too much longer theres a chance that we can get a snapback in the economy that most people would not expect because it wasnt structurally in trouble to start with truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 now if it stays on a long time then all bets are off i personally believe as we head into the first quarter well begin to see some real developments with regard to vaccines we certainly have already had substantial developments positive developments with regard to medical mitigation of indiscernible ramification so we are somewhat optimistic although cautious as we think about the economy going forward i will tell you as i get feedback from our clientfacing people and while theyre not facing them in person as much today were talking to people more probably than we ever did now although virtually david weaver who runs our commercial community bank told me the other day he had nine calls in one day so weve been very very efficient but heres the point clients are being very resilient im speaking particularly of middle and upper market one of the quotes that i got recently was clients that say its time to move on and to be honest thats kind of what we said we sat back for a while and didnt make virtual calls and said were waiting for the pandemic and then several months ago we just kind of said weve got to get on with running our business because our clients need us so our clients are being indiscernible saying kind of my business is okay now the small very small micro end is struggling and depending on how long this lasts we will see a substantial shakeout in the small business micro end market at the aggregate economic level that will reshuffle and reallocate itself but at a personal level for those small business ph they possess a very sad story so we got to hope that this moves along as rapidly as possible ill say finally that our pipelines are improving our calling activity is robust and we feel very good about where were going relative to what happens to the economy on slide just a brief comment about deposits which are doing great we continue to have a nice inflow somewhat because of the flight to quality we had billion increase in deposits on a linked quarter basis we had a billion increase following other previous quarter increases in noninterestbearing deposits so we feel really good about that our noninterestbearing deposits today are of total deposits versus in the first quarter so you can see how rapidly our dda or noninterestbearing deposits have increased weve been focusing a lot of our attention with regard to getting our costs down with regard to deposit structure and weve made really good progress here our total deposit cost decreased from basis points to basis points average interestbearing deposits decreased basis points down to basis points so really good progress in managing our cost of deposit i would point out if you are following the math in all of our deposit activity though we did divest billion in deposits this quarter and so thats a material factor so overall i would say our deposits are doing great with that let me turn it to daryl for some more detail daryl n bible chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you kelly and good morning everyone today i want to cover highlights from the third quarter and provide our fourth quarter outlook turning to slide reported net interest margin decreased basis points primarily due to lower purchase accounting accretion core net interest margin increased basis points the first increase since the first quarter core margin benefited from strong dda growth lower funding costs lower covidrelated deferred interest lower yields on loans and securities remain a headwind truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 during the quarter we used excess reserves to purchase billion of highquality securities improving our yield on those assets by approximately basis points our asset sensitivity increased in the third quarter and we plan to stay slightly asset sensitive we will continue to protect our margin by placing rate floors on commercial loans and manage deposit costs due to our excess funding position we are being strategic about deposit costs by focusing on growing noninterestbearing deposits given the low rate environment we are placing pay fixed swaps to partially hedge our investment securities and associated changes in oci we expect the reported net interest margin to slightly decrease for the remainder of the year turning to slide adjusted noninterest income was relatively flat versus a robust second quarter fee income categories impacted by the pandemic continue to improve our activity on deposits is normalizing coupled with lower fee waivers card and payment related fees increased as payment volumes improved wealth management income increased as a result of higher market valuations despite the seasonally weak quarter insurance income grew on a like quarter basis due to firmer pricing and uptick in new business residential mortgage income decreased primarily due to a million change in the net msr valuation driven by higher prepayments investment banking had a record quarter trading was off from a great second quarter resulting in lower revenue other income increased due to the increase in the value of nonqualified plan assets and other investments turning to slide noninterest expense decreased million as losses on debt extinguishment and higher intangible amortization during the second quarter were partially offset by higher mergerrelated costs and a charitable contribution adjusted noninterest expense increased million primarily due to an increased personnel expense marketing costs and professional services the increase in personnel expense reflects higher nonqualified plan costs that were offset by other income higher medical costs due to normalization pension cost adjustment and a reduced labor cost capitalization due to lower loan volume truist remains highly disciplined on core expenses average ftes decreased during the quarter and we expect further reductions this year we plan to close branches in december and january and are looking at ways to bring forward more branch closures in turning to slide asset quality ratios remain relatively stable the npa ratio increased basis point to basis points and the npl ratio increased basis points to basis points primarily due to ci loans annualized net chargeoffs relative to average loans and leases increased basis points to basis points we took a million pcd adjustment to net chargeoffs excluding that net chargeoffs would have been basis points the provision of million exceeded net chargeoffs of million increasing an allowance by million the allowance was of loans and leases up for coverage ratios remained strong at times net chargeoffs and times nonperforming loans a combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value mark remains very robust at of total loans turning to slide our exposure to sensitive industries continues to decline to a low of of loans held for investment outstanding balances to sensitive industries decreased billion to billion we continue to closely monitor and manage our sensitive industry portfolios turning to slide the volume of loans with the accommodations have decreased significantly since june approximately million of commercial loans had an active activation at the end of september down from truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 billion and consumer billion at active accommodation down from billion the declines reflect expiration of the initial payment relief which was not renewed by the borrower since june approximately of the commercial borrowers and of the consumer borrowers who exited payment release either paid off their balance or are in current status turning to slide the allowance for credit losses increased million to reflect loan regrading uncertainty related to the expiration of government stimulus programs our economic assumptions include extended gdp recovering high singledigit unemployment through mid2021 followed by continued improvement through the remaining reasonable and supportable forecast period our acl estimate also reflects qualitative adjustments for our model limitations government stimulus accommodations and a review of snc turning to slide capital ratios improved for the second straight quarter and are strong relative to regulatory requirements our reported cet1 ratio increased to from last quarter we also issued million of preferred stock to strengthen our tier and total capital ratios the recent assigned stress capital buffer of basis points will remain in effect until september when a revised stress capital buffer will be provided next we plan to submit our capital plan in early november as required by the federal reserve our purpose of capital priorities continue to be organic growth in our dividend we remain open to bolton acquisitions with fee income businesses turning to slide liquidity remains strong with an lcr ratio of a and liquid asset buffer of our access to secured funding sources is robust with over billion of cash securities and secured borrowing parent company is sufficient to cover months of contractual and expected outflows with no inflows turning to slide we continue to see strong growth in digital banking truist opened up net new accounts versus last quarter driven by digital and increased branch traffic for the months through august we experienced a increase in digital sales increase in active mobile users increase in mobile check deposits and a increase in statement suppression we are also proud of a recognition we received recently from javelin heritage bbt was recognized as a leader in ease of use and financial fitness in mobile banking and a leader in financial fitness in online banking heritage suntrust was recognized as a leader in ease of use and online banking these awards demonstrate the strength of our heritage platforms and the opportunities as truist advances digital capabilities turning to slide as we have said our primary reason for the merger is to exceed client expectations through seamless integration of touch and technology to create trust to get there we are harvesting cost saves from combined companies to fund increased investment and ultimately drive bestinclass performance we are fully committed to achieving billion in net cost saves and continue to make good progress on personnel expense corporate real estate branch rationalization thirdparty spend and system decommissioning and data center closures at the same time were also investing in digital marketing and technology we are also investing in talent including areas outside of digital and our revenue businesses together these investments and cost saves will allow us to generate bestinclass returns versus our peers while providing distinctive secure and successful client experiences through touch and technology now i will provide our fourth quarter guidance which is based on linkedquarter changes versus the third quarter for our guidance audio gap provides a path to positive operating leverage we expect taxable truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 equivalent revenue excluding onetime security gains to be down to driven by lower purchase accounting and accretion we expect reported net interest margin to be down basis points to basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion and core margin to be relatively flat core noninterest expense adjusted for merger costs and amortization is expected to be down to reflecting lower personnel expense we also anticipate net chargeoffs to between basis points and basis points now let me turn it back to kelly for our merger update closing remarks and qa kelly s king chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks daryl if you follow along on slide i would say to you generally the merger is on track integration and conversion we feel really good about where we are and making really great progress most importantly our culture is really strong and i would say to you kind of interestingly that the covid experience has actually bonded our team together even faster than we would have expected because when you go through a really really tough time and youre kind of thrown on the boat together it encourages all strength in terms of developing relationship trust and bonding so we could not feel better about how strong our culture is and how well it is developing some very notable activities in terms of the integration and conversion we did complete the branch divestiture as i mentioned we recently announced something were very excited about what we call truist ventures this is where we were making relatively small but important investments in technology platforms that we can build into our value proposition we are testing now for our client conversions in wealth and mortgage which will come up in the spring so therell be a number of conversions that have occurred or will occur on the way toward the core conversion we did launch our dual service branch pilots this is a technical thing but its very important as we move down the road as daryl alluded to in terms of accelerating our branch closings as we head into next year very importantly we did complete our endtoend truist securities conversion this was our big deal as we know this was the first virtual conversion that has occurred and it was seamless our people did a fantastic job and its a big deal because were a really big securities operation now backing up our corporate and investment banking business our core conversion is on track for the first half of so we feel good about where everything is with regard to the integration and conversion if you look at slide just a word about our value proposition as we wrap up we are as i said in the beginning driven by our purpose which is to inspire and build better lives and communities our goal longterm is to grow earnings with less volatility relative to our peers over the longterm thats kind of a commitment we made to our shareholders we base that on a very exceptional franchise with diverse products services and markets as we said we are the sixth largest commercial bank in the us today that gives us scale to be able to compete were very strong in our marketplace and that gives us the efficiencies that we need we are the sixth largest insurance broker we have really strong growth there i think were going to report organic growth which we believe were probably at the top in the market were the number one regional bank on investment firm were the number two regional bank on mortgage originator and servicer so very very strong franchise were really positioned well to be bestinclass in terms of efficiency and returns at the same time well be investing heavily in the future as daryl said we are confident in achieving our billion of net cost savings at the same time well be investing in our revenue synergy operation i will tell you that our irm our integrated relationship management strategy is going great as you know in the beginning we said there were huge opportunities to leverage the strengths that suntrust had and the strengths that bbt had and i would say that truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 its ahead of schedule the receptivity of our people with regard to crossselling if you will these products and services across the organization is robust and frankly theres just a lot of enthusiasm about it we are making key investments in technology in our teammates in marketing and in advertising all of which will drive our above average organic growth and longterm stable and growing profitability at the same time we have a very strong capital base as you can see very strong liquidity and a very resilient risk profile we are very prudent and disciplined in risk and financial management we have a very conservative risk culture we have very diversified benefits arising from the merger that will just kind of naturally implicit in the merger we stress test very well as youve seen we have very strong capital very strong liquidity and we have a very strong and defensive balance sheet which is insulated by purchase accounting marks combined with cecl credit reserves so overall i would say we have a great culture we have a great franchise we have a great team and i fully believe our best days are ahead ryan ryan richards directorinvestor relations truist financial corp thank you kelly vijay at this time would you please explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session question and answer section operator sure sir thank you operator instructions we will now take our first question from ken usdin from jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks here we go thanks good morning ryan richards a directorinvestor relations truist financial corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc daryl i want to ask you a question on the expense side clear that your timing on the cost saves is on track from a longterm perspective two pieces number one at what point do we see the incremental operating expenses start to settle back down because theyve been on a steady increase since september of last year and then two can you give us any update in terms of your expected realization of those cost saves as we kind of reset the bar in a covid world and understand like just your timing recognition of those cost saves thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so ken what i would tell you is that we are still on the uptick in our merger and mourelated expenses we are just going through the developing phases of that testing starts in the first quarter as we start with sit testing and then we go into uat testing as we get ready for client they won in early part of so i would say were truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 still on the uptick there todate since we announced the transaction in february we have about billion of combined ph merc and mourelated expenses and at that time we said we would be at billion i dont have a number of what it is going yes we will probably give that to you in january we will probably exceed that number sometime in the first quarter the billion number i want to give you a number and make sure we hit the number that i give you in our earnings call in january from that standpoint so were coming through figuring all that out and well get back to you on that but i would say well still stay elevated for the next several quarters and we have thousands and thousands of people right now working on hundreds of systems getting them ready getting them tested and we just got to make sure this is flawless i mean we have to be have a great client experience we have to make sure everything goes right that cost a little bit of money you have to remember ken on this we chose to choose the better of the two when we had our choices we didnt take the easy way out and just convert everything all one way or the other so for the commercial platform we chose to use the heritage bbt servicing system afs coupled with the heritage suntrust and cno piece that takes a lot more time a lot more complexity but when we get it done we will be so far better were doing it in the retail banking platform as well where we have the bbt heritage deposit system coupled with the heritage suntrust automated teller again more complexity but when we get through all this in we will be light years ahead of most of our peers because of what were doing from that so its the right thing to do it costs a lot of money to do it were going to do it right and were going to execute ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and one longterm question i know that with the low rotce the outlook that you had previously was precovid a lot of changes out there consensus for is obviously nowhere near it can you help us understand like what you think is doable longer term obviously the provisions a big input into that or at what point do you think we can get some updated expectations on whats doable for this franchise thanks guys kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp ken we still feel confident over the longterm and the original expectation of low rotce remember were already very very strong in the environment that were in today and as daryl described we are really just getting started in terms of getting the longterm investments made and the related expense reductions that will follow and then of course you got all the revenue synergies that i alluded to so we feel very very good about that obviously well ebb and flow some based on the economy but thats still a reasonable number to shoot for ryan richards a directorinvestor relations truist financial corp next question please operator thank you operator instructions we will now take our next question from michael rose from raymond james michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys hope youre doing well daryl i just wanted to get some color on this quarters pcd review and then if you can give us some credit metrics around the kind of the select atrisk exposures i truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 obviously saw the balance has dropped but if you can give us any sort of sense on what the migration looks like this quarter in some of those atrisk exposures thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so michael ill take the pcd question then ill kick to clarke and he can maybe answer the accommodation piece of it so on the pcd remember when we closed in december we closed under the now what i would say old accounting method where we had to set up pci when cecl came in into january we went from pci to pcd in that process we went through we grossed up loans and carrying values in connection with the establishment of pcd of our best estimates as the year played out what we realized is we grossed up the loans and we should have not grossed them up to the full value they should have been stayed chargedoff from that perspective so it was the adjustment that we made this quarter we think weve gone through the book and weve got everything there so in that sense we would have just had a different number in the first quarter when we got our cecl numbers but it was an adjustment that we made its a noncash item and we had really good chargeoffs if you exclude that million we had good chargeoffs even if you add that in thats million both big guidance clarke clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp thanks daryl hey michael as far as the sensitive industry you see on the slide there weve got in the deck we had a nice couple billion dollar reduction this quarter its been a very targeted effort to work with those borrowers and to reduce the exposure so i would say the highlights of the quarter there is we worked very aggressively to get a handle on particularly in the energy portfolio and hospitality side we actually sold million worth of hotel credits at pretty good pricing and also addressed a good bit of the energy book so to give you some context nonperformers in that portfolio of sensitive industries are still less than basis points and we have less than of those balances that are in any kind of accommodation or deferral so i consider really strong progress and well continue to watch that closely and its all considered in our reserves as well michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay i appreciate that and maybe this is my followup you guys hit cet1 obviously buybacks on hold for you and others this quarter how should we think about capital deployment any updated thoughts that you guys have would be appreciated thanks kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so mike were really happy to be at and as you know weve said that that was our target so thats a very comfortable position as we think about it going forward its really a function of of course when were actually able to do buybacks and dividend increases but the way we think about it is about risk projection and so if we look forward and we feel like the economy is stabilized and growing if we look forward in terms of the pandemic and its under control and we can feel comfortable in terms of a projected relatively stable less volatile growing truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 revenue stream then well feel comfortable in terms of turning back on buybacks and considering dividend increases id say today its just premature we just dont know what we dont know and if we go out there today and try to make those kind of assumptions i think is just shooting in the dark i do think as we head into next year well see clarity with regard to the pandemic well see clarity with regard to the economy as i said earlier i think theres a chance of the economy will be better ph than most things so theres a decent chance well have that decision to make as we head into the lets call it first half of next year but today its just a tad premature michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc understood ryan richards a directorinvestor relations truist financial corp vijay will you please take our next question michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you operator sure we will now take our next lesson from gerard cassidy from rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning kelly kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi daryl good morning kelly daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp hi how are you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good thank you daryl can you share with us you mentioned that you guys purchased billion of securities using your excess reserves and you helped the nim by about basis point whats left i mean how much more of the excess reserves can you put to work and can you also share with us what was the duration of those purchases to be able to ph hit that higher net interest margin even though it was only basis point truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so gerard so our current duration of our portfolio because our prepayment speeds picked up were just a tad over three years right now years but they do have negative convexity so it can move in and out from that perspective what i would say is that we are in the midst of moving some more of our liquidity that we have at the fed we have a little over billion at the fed currently we are moving that over some of it this quarter maybe more of it into early next year we are layering in some hedges now i would tell you that hedges that were putting on are pay fixed hedges were buying mortgage back which as you know has cash flows that pay down over the life of those assets the way fasb has approved hedge accounting on this its only allowed to use bullet swaps they do have a task force that they are working on trying to look for other ways to allow for this its called lastoflayer hedging and were hopeful that well be able to put on a little stronger hedges but the hedges were putting on will mute some of the oci volatility if they come through and allow us to use maybe amortizing swaps instead of just bullet swaps that would significantly improve the performance of those hedges so were hopeful about that but we are trying to hedge it the best that you can right now the costs of these pay fixed swaps are really low its basis points so it doesnt really impact it so we are in the midst of indiscernible yeah i always look at it as an opportunity cost right now we could have lower rates for the next three years thats whats in the forecast five years you just dont know and i think its good to be deployed the way i would think of it though is that if rates were to go up or if we started to lose some of the surge deposits our cash flows from this investment portfolio ph were voting could be easily billion a quarter so we could just ph not reinvest if we have strong loan growth we could use that cash flow to deploy into loan growth so it gives us a lot more flexibility a lot more optionality and it also helps protect our margin and help run rate you pay us to run our company and do what we think is best we think this is a good balanced approach to managing the company gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and as a followup kelly i share your view about the vaccine for this covid and the therapeutics that well have next year and hopefully the economy really starts to open up i want to come back to something you said about the small business owners and if the economy doesnt come back there could be some real meaningful fallout can you kind of frame for us and i know its subjective but can you frame for us when does if the economy doesnt come back by the second quarter or the first quarter when do you really start to get concerned about that fallout kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp well gerard thats something obviously we dont know but i think today that some of course have already gone away i mean they couldnt for whatever reason they couldnt qualify for the stimulus they chose not to they just threw in the towel but thats a small percentage most have been buoyed by the stimulus ph or truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 ppp and other loan assistance programs as that begins to phase out these businesses will have tougher decisions to make but ill tell you that a lot of these small businesses are pretty creative and theyre pretty resilient and so i mean i wouldnt expect to see a majority of small businesses fold or anywhere close to that i think most are going to find ways to reinvent their business its incredible how smart small business people are indiscernible basically my whole career and theyre a pretty tough group so i wouldnt write them off im just saying that it aint gone into the second quarter and ph consensus is out and consumers arent back out buying again and we will see a shakeout but heres the thing today consumer purchases are back up and if you look at credit card activity i mean its up yearoveryear so it went through a trough indiscernible yearoveryear so theyre buying theres buying in different ways so what these small businesses have to do is figure out what this carryout or dineout in the backyard or whatever it is if youre in restaurant the creative ones will figure it out some wont be able to figure it out and theyll have to find another career but i think that all will begin to be clearer gerard as we head into the second quarter gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah ryan richards a directorinvestor relations truist financial corp vijay please transition to our next question operator sure we will now take our next question from john pancari from evercore isi kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp john john pancari q analyst evercore isi hi just on credit just a couple twopart question there first on the delinquencies looks like both 90plus days and to days increased just want to get some color what youre seeing beginning to migrate if theres any concentration there whats driving that and then separately on the loan loss reserve if we do see the delinquency you start to interpret into a steady rise in chargeoffs is it fair to assume as chargeoffs rise that youre adequately reserved and accordingly you could see the reservetoloan ratio decline as that happens thanks clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 hi john this is yeah this is clarke ill answer that john on the delinquency side we typically see in consumer anyway some elevated early stage as you go through the second half of the year so third quarter is going up a little bit part of thats seasonal youll see a lot of its concentrated in the government guaranteed portfolios around student and mortgage so if you take that out particularly for your 90plus days that was the majority there it was flat otherwise so again nothing alarming at this point we anticipate part of that each year and to your second question all of that is considered as we go through our modeling and our allowance and our view of the scenarios that we selected so yes i think wed assume there will be further deterioration as we move forward this is very likely and thats all been included in our estimate todate john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay good thats helpful and then secondly on the noninterest margin front i know that you indicated that daryl that the reported margin should see some slight pressure through the remainder of the year i just want to get your thoughts on the core margin outlook just given some of the actions youve taken and how youre thinking about that from here daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so i would tell you we had a good drop in deposit costs this past quarter but we still think we have room to go there so our interestbearing costs are ph basis points my guess is over the next quarter or two well be single digits i think thats just the direction that were headed right now i think thats a possibility i think that will help i think as we can grow some of our consumer portfolios successfully that will help mitigate some of our core margins we have higher yields in those portfolios and that would definitely help as were able to be successful in growing that and the other thing i would just tell you is that we are doing everything we can to protect our core margin and try to grow as much as we can to offset the runoff but the runoff for purchase accounting is a little bit its hard to predict it depends on how the loans pay down on that my guess right now is that itll be down to right now but you really dont know whats going to come through from that you just have to do the best that you can with whats running off from that but with ppp coming out over the next couple quarters that will help keep core margin probably in the and that will help mitigate the reduction of gap to what depending how much you get ppp to pay down now our guess is the bulk of our pay downs will come in the first quarter maybe second quarter well get some this quarter recall our company has about billion of ppp loans on the books we are planning to have invitations sent to all of our clients in the month of november so theyll all get invitations how quickly they can respond with the documentation and we submit it to sba is just a huge process thats why were thinking its more centered in the first half of ph and in this quarter but you dont really know its an unknown right now kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp well couple other things keep in mind that our people have been very successful in terms of floors with regard to new loans and existing renewals the other thing is that if the economy comes back faster which i think it may theres going to be a substantial pentup demand for expansions and so we will see an increase in loan demand truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 for id call it normally price loans which will be a plus with regard to nim so couple of things could really help us on nim in addition to what daryl said john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thank you thats helpful i know you said relatively flat on the core nim in your guidance i was just looking for the drivers behind it and then maybe the behavior beyond that thank you appreciate it ryan richards a directorinvestor relations truist financial corp thank you vijay were ready for next question operator sure well now take our next question from betsy graseck from morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi hi good morning okay a couple of questions one is on how you think about the reserve release i know its early to ask this question but we all model out a couple of years so im just trying to understand what your thought process is with regard to when you would start to release reserves is it to match any net chargeoffs that you get from here or maybe theres something else youre thinking about you could let us in on thanks kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp clarke do you want to take that or clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah maybe ill start and then daryl or kelly you can kick in kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp okay clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp certainly betsy we think its premature to be talking about releases right now given the environment so i think youll see in our estimate this quarter weve been i think prudent around considering theres still a lot of economic truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 uncertainty around it whether therell be any more stimulus what the ultimate outcome of these accommodations are and just pace of the recovery so i think for us we would want to be sure we have much better clarity there and see the economy on very firm ground and the client performance fee at a really strong level before i think youd see us consider releases betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and i guess the question kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah go ahead kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp just ph one other thing that would be kind interesting but to your point if everything were precise as i understand it the economy was performing as we expected in terms of our safer projections rates are as we projected so our net present value analysis is the same what we project if all of that would happen itd be correlation between reserve and projections and indiscernible but as clarke said its not going to be correlation and the other thing is and i hope this is not true but do we get any pressure from regulators to hold reserves up even though all the math and all the concepts there should be coming down weve not heard anything about that but thats always a lot more betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah so how does that work with cecl as my followup question i know maybe thats a little bit longer than the time you want to spend on it on this topic but the question really is around how to think about the trajectory of the reserves from here like in the old incurred loss model there was some general reserve that you could have and im just wondering as we go through this recession and we have maybe some asset classes are experiencing greater than expected loss others less than expected loss can you shift the reserves around and the question really ends up being how fungible are the reserves that you put up against these specific asset classes that youve identified thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp clarke ill start if you want to maybe add to it but i mean we do it both ways betsy and that we do a bottomup analysis so our modelers go through and remodel all of the portfolios and we run it against the scenarios and we come up with a bottomup analysis given the limitations of the models and the uncertainty in the environment truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 theres always top down adjustments that occur that are basically in play there so its really its a process you go through you have to know what you have in the models today if the economy gets better and everything else stays the same you could see a release potentially but thats not reality things are always changing things are always getting rerated up and down in the portfolio client behaviors are changing more chargeoffs or whatever so its always a dynamic process i think clarke and his team do a great job in analyzing it we thoroughly review it several times before we come up with our numbers each quarter so its hard to predict right now especially with the uncertainty how high the economic variables are today and the model limitations out there theres a lot of qualitative adjustments occurring right now clarke clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp no no i think you said it well daryl i think its very granular by segment and that segment analysis and our view of the economy and the impact on all of that does allow us to adjust the estimate as needed and so you could have differences quartertoquarter by those different segments and that could impact the level of the estimate betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks very much daryl and clarke appreciate it clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp sure daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp thanks betsy ryan richards a directorinvestor relations truist financial corp great we are ready for the next question operator yeah we will take our next question from mike mayo from wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi my question goes to slide where the efficiency trends have not gone on the right direction the last couple of quarters but you just gave guidance for that to improve in the fourth quarter you talked about personnel savings cre branch third party systems and closing branches so i think im summarizing what i heard so my question is why not more why not faster this is one of the biggest merger overlaps that youve seen youre allowed to close branches starting in december yesterday us bancorp said theyre going to close branches and you just said youre going to close about branches it just seems like you could do a lot more and are you just being too safe to get the merger integration smooth i mean you are growing deposits no blow ups and im sure youre protecting a longterm franchise but i thought that efficiency story would be coming in a little sooner than its come in thanks truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so michael ill start with that and others can help me finish the answer so ill start with we have five plus sets of cost savings you started with the branch system so we are closing branches as i said in my prepared remarks in decemberjanuary timeframe i also said that were looking at opportunities to pull forward from other branch closures in we arent at the stage yet to announce exactly what were going to do there but we did give you an indication that there is a possibility and we wouldnt have said that if it wasnt a strong reality that were going to pull forward a significant piece of some branch closures in well give you that once we are able to do that if you look at our thirdparty spend or thirdparty providers todate right now with dealing with vendors our sourcing and procurement teams have basically realized million of savings from that we think that run rate translates into about million in they are not at their goals yet theyre still trying to get more savings we think that will occur over the next year or so we hope those numbers will exceed million before its all said and done from a run rate perspective as contracts come up as we redeploy were still going through the process of negotiating contracts with an end provider of these services that we are having right now so not everything can be fully negotiated yet next one would be on our nonbranch facilities we talked about that in our last earnings call we have million square feet outstanding if you add branches and nonbranches out there we talked about potentially taking million square feet out in our nonbranch areas this next year we said the average cost of that on a gross basis was a square foot therell be a little bit investment come back as we refit under the socially distance areas and all that for the buildings that are surviving we have branches that will probably have another million square feet to million square feet there so therell be close to million square feet probably by the end of in our company from that perspective so ph at the third that were taking out very aggressively very quickly the fourth area is in technology i talked about it in the prepared remarks were just now getting in the midst of getting through conversions weve done some small conversions not client facing and weve started a decommissioned systems starting to get systems there we just did the conversion in beaus area in the capital markets large corporate area and all that stuff so those savings are going to be captured as we get through conversions in the first quarter and joes area with wealth and brokerdealer that we have there ph and the in that ones in first quarter the other ones in second quarter it takes probably three to six months before we get through and get those systems decommissioned scott has plans to we dont need four data centers right now were going to end up with a couple of data centers at the end of the day that will probably be a saving so we will get those savings its just a matter of when we are able to get those close and get everything transferred and the last one on personnel if you look at our ftes every quarter theyve been falling in ftes and we pulled forward ftes as we go through these conversions were going to have continued fte closures i mean we dont need as much of the areas on the support side as we go through these conversions and get things finalized so theres a lot to come were not backing down from the billion we arent backing down from the timing were going to come through on target like we said we were and this is just a way of doing it kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 and mike just to amplify your question is a good one its appropriate about the branches but two points up to this point we have been cautious in terms of closing branches because we want to have wanted to have maximum availability for our clients keep in mind that we had to basically close down the lobbies and were fortunate about 98pluspercent of our branches have drivethroughs so our drivethroughs have been open throughout for the last several months weve had inbranch activity based on appointments only we just opened up this week like branches full service in the lobby so once we get the branches back to kind of normal and our client service capabilities back to normal then we will be more aggressive in terms of the closings because we have a large number of branches that are literally side to side actually in many cases sharing the same parking lot and our people like daryl alluded are literally in the process of developing aggressive plan with regard to that so dont hear us say were not going to be aggressive with regard to branch closures but were not just going to announce it today because theyre literally in the process of putting the final touches on what its going to look like mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one followup just to put a bow around it how much in merger cost savings do you have so far in the third quarter run rate and what do you expect for and again daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp so for the third quarter were probably around give or take were still targeting in the fourth quarter the guidance that we gave is in the middle of that range that i gave you there so were plus or minus on that side of that for the end of fourth quarter of were still at of the billion and then the whole billion by the end of so we are not changing the timing of that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah ryan richards a directorinvestor relations truist financial corp operator were ready for the next question operator yeah we will now take our next question from saul martinez from ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning following up a little bit on nii daryl what is embedded in your fourth quarter core nim reported nim guidance for ppp forgiveness if anything and can you just remind us or give us an update as to what you are thinking right now for forgiveness rates over i would say maybe i guess the next three quarters and truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 any color on what the sort of the fee rate is on that forgiveness because obviously it does move the needle a bit on nii with that accelerated forgiveness daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so what i would say and we talked about this last quarter now our estimate hasnt really changed and that we still think of it will pay off with this forgiveness piece thats a guesstimate we really dont know we are like i said earlier sending invitations out to everybody ph from that for this fourth quarter of that were probably around thats a shot in the dark of what actually might get paid off we really dont know the timing if you look at the news that came out last week from the sba and the twopager for the or less the numbers on that is out of our clients we have clients that are or less but it only represents of the dollars so its a huge volume piece so hopefully a lot of that most of that will probably get processed very quickly but weve actually gone through and done some forgiveness on a limited basis just to learn the process and weve actually gotten paid from the sba on a couple so were learning and gearing up and were getting ready to do it holistically out to everybody at once once we got the processes all lined up so were gearing up for that we think the first quarter saul will be our biggest quarter right now the estimates are around and the rest would be in the second quarter but you really dont know when the timing of it is its a pure shot in the dark but thats whats in our numbers right now saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right and i know its more tilted towards first quarter but does your fourth quarter guidance explicitly incorporate that forgiveness and certain fee rate on top of that i know im getting a little bit nitpicky here but indiscernible daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp ph hey youre right there is risk i mean if its less than we may miss core if its more than we may exceed core but that wont be the only end all be all on core ph reported there are a lot of other variables but that is an assumption that plays out absolutely there the other thing you have to think about saul is when can you realize it just because somebody sends it in did you realize it when they send it in or when they actually get the dollars wired back into us so were working with our external auditors on the timing of when well recognize that fee payoff saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right without ppp forgiveness can you maintain core nim flat or is it pretty much impossible to do that given the environment daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp my guess is that the core margin without ppp is probably in the high2 right now would be my guess maybe still i mean we are it all depends on what kelly said the loan growth the ability to grow the higher yielding truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 portfolios and really get a mix change if we could just mix invest some of the excess liquidity that we have in loans versus securities or fed balances thats a really positive way to help your core margin its just a matter of trying to get the loan volume to support that saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc just one final quick just absolutely just want to make sure the guidance for expenses and revenue that is based on the adjusted noninterest expense number billion and incorporates the adjusted noninterest income i guess of billion just want to clarify that daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah in my prepared remarks i adjusted both the expense side and the revenue side saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay just want to make sure thank you ryan richards directorinvestor relations truist financial corp that concludes our qa session thank you vijay and thank you everyone for joining us today i apologize to those with questions we didnt have time to get to were happy to
