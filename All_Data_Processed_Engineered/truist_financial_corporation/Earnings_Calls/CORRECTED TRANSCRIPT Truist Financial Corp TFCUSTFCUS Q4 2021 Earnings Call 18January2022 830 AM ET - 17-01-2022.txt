have momentum going into this year ill share more details on this topic during the presentation now turning to slide as always im going to begin with purpose which is to inspire and build better lives and communities we believe our purposedriven culture is the foundation for our success as a company our purpose defines how we do business every day and it serves as a framework for how we make decisions our purpose truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 driven culture is also the foundation for how we attract and retain top talent people simply want to work

career mobility and our more flexible approach to work will be your formula for attracting and retaining the best talent at truist and competing and winning in the ongoing war for talent slide highlights some of the ways were putting our purpose into action this slide is organized around the same major themes contained in our csr and our esg report since theyre topics that are most relevant to all of our stakeholders including our shareholders i cannot be more proud of both the quantity and most importantly the quality of the work being done across all these dimensions and the tremendous impact we are having in our communities while i cant cover every point on the slide let me highlight a few on the technology front we were excited to welcome our teammates to the recently completed innovation and technology center in charlotte and look forward to our external grand opening in the first of the year as you know truist has an unwavering commitment to diversity equity and inclusion and im very pleased to report that we recently achieved our goal to increase ethnically diverse representation in senior leadership roles to at least this was a year earlier than our original commitment while were proud to have achieved this milestone we acknowledge that this is actually the beginning and not the end we have also intentionally implemented a flexible work strategy for our teammates which includes onsite remote and hybrid options hybrid and more flexible works here to stay and ive learned the meaning and the power of intentional flexibility the concept of people coming together as a team whether in the office or not and intentional deciding descending what works best for them their team our clients and the company while remaining highly engaged and most importantly purposeful finally we released our inaugural tcfd report in middecember which adds further context and disclosures to our previous csr and esg reports at truist we view all the elements of esg as an opportunity to improve our company and operationalize our purpose including climate change for instance were adding new teammates within cib in our commercial community bank who are going to help our clients transition to a lower carbon economy now turning to slide this quarter we had million of aftertax mergerrelated and restructuring charges and million of aftertax incremental operating expenses related to the merger the total eps impact of merger related costs was a share while our decision to create a best of both model of integration has resulted in increased upfront cost i firmly believe it creates the best platform for future investment and growth the good news is that total merger cost will be cut approximately in half in compared to last year and then fall out of our expense base entirely after this year now turning to our fourth quarter performance on slide as i indicated the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a solid year as most areas were generally in line or somewhat ahead of our expectations were at billion or earnings per share for the quarter on a reported basis excluding the merger impacts on the prior slide were at billion or per share primary driver of changes in eps relative to both the prior quarter and year ago was a loan loss provision given a rapidly evolving economic environment over the past two years we generated strong returns including a adjusted rotce which was unchanged from last quarter excluding the reserve release adjusted rotce was a still a very strong asset quality continues to be an truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 excellent story and net chargeoffs were in line with our guidance capital deployment was robust during the fourth quarter as we funded strong organic loan growth closed the service finance acquisition in early december and repurchased million worth of common stock well provide more details about loan growth momentarily on the merger integration front we completed the first part of the core bank conversion in midoctober by migrating our heritage bbt clients to the truist ecosystem as part of the conversion we launched the new truistcom as well as our digital commerce account opening platform since then our integration teams have completed two successful dress rehearsals for a final conversion one in middecember and one just this past weekend i want to personally thank our teammates for their hard work and dedication to this effort because of them were on track for the final core conversion in february during which our heritage suntrust clients will be migrated to the truist ecosystem looking at full year truist had a productive year across multiple dimensions from a financial perspective we generated significant adjusted net income of billion or per share and had an adjusted rotce of while our earnings undoubtedly benefited from a billion lower loan loss provision due to the improvement in economy we also demonstrated the strength of our diverse business mix fee income excluding security gains increased a very strong as were firing on multiple cylinders this performance helped offset a decline in mortgage fee income and a decrease in net interest income we also continue to deliver on our costsave programs evidenced by an adjusted expenses increasing only during the year which saw much larger increases in fee income we also experienced a reduction in our risk profile due to improvement in economy and merger integration progress which enabled us to reduce the cet1 target by basis points to and deploy significantly more capital overall we were able to make great progress on multiple fronts despite continued headwinds from the pandemic while delivering improved financial performance for our shareholders turning to slide our new truist digital experience reflects two of our core digital and technology principles co creation with our clients and moving fast in order to learn fast our more modern and agile platform allows us to incorporate this feedback quickly the results of which can be seen in the significant improvements in our overall client satisfaction scores as well as in our apple app store and google play store ratings in just a few short months weve now migrated approximately million retail wealth and small business clients to the truist digital experience through december more than of active clients have begun to use the new digital platform in lieu of their heritage app on slide you will see a visual of our new corporate and commercial digital platform which we call truist one view this platform will provide our clients with a comprehensive view of their existing treasury management and lending solutions via streamlined and clientspecific experience designed to reduce the time required to perform routine financial task including the launch of truist one view to our commercial clients truist has introduced new web and mobile platforms for each of our client segments across retail wealth business and corporate more than features were released across these platforms in and weve done this at the pace that neither heritage company could have achieved on their own truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 more broadly as you can see from the charts on the left we continue to position ourselves to serve the robust demand for digital services digital lending mobile check deposits and zelle transactions all exhibited doubledigit growth during the year we feel good about our current digital performance and we believe that our progress will accelerate after the final core bank conversion in part due to the advantages and efficiencies associated with having one website one search engine optimization process one brand one system and one digital application but also in part due to the new capabilities that well be able to introduce this year including our new aidriven insights tool our new truist virtual assistant and the truist developer center which will position us to innovate and collaborate with the developer community having our teams focus on the new truist experience versus managing three separate experiences will provide a significant productivity lift as we move forward lastly we have plans to make strong digital progress in other areas this year from our new partnership and integration with autofi enhancing our insurtech capabilities via integrating insurance directly into our mortgage process and launching a new deposit product with lightstream on a realtime cloudbased core now turning to loans and leases on slide average loans stabilized after decreasing for five consecutive quarters and peeling back the onion reveals positive and improving underlying trends excluding ppp average loans increased approximately sequentially and end of period loans grew approximately reflecting momentum late in the quarter the most notable improvement was in ci where end of period balances excluding ppp grew billion or reflecting broadbased growth across corporate and commercial lines of business this was the strongest pointtopoint ci loan growth since the first quarter of most cib industry and product groups demonstrated growth most notably within our asset finance group broad based growth was also evident within our commercial community bank where of the regions grew ci loans excluding ppp during the quarter and we continue to see the most growth in markets that are relatively more open every single one of our industry specialty groups within the ccb grew a strong reflection of how our clients value industry expertise and advice revolver utilization also ticked up after six straight quarters of declines and equally important total revolver exposure continues to grow evidence of our relevance and that our clients are building capacity for investments and expansion residential mortgage continues to grow reflecting slower prepayment speeds our decision to balance sheet certain correspondent production and increase capacity post conversions and covid excluding mortgage consumer balances decreased slightly primarily due to seasonality in our sheffield business and continued declines in our government guaranteed student loan portfolio service finance closed on december and we feel great about their trajectory heading into in addition some of the areas that have been headwinds like dealer floor plan and cre are beginning to stabilize overall corporate and commercial clients remain optimistic despite ongoing labor shortages supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures were encouraged by the momentum we observed in the fourth quarter but also in our pipelines which are the highest theyve been in some time we continue to believe there is meaningful upside to the ci growth story as the economy continues to improve although the timing remains imprecise we also continue to feel confident in our consumer trajectory as were well positioned with respect to faster growing segments through our digital and pointofsale businesses which will offset headwinds in other areas truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 now turning to deposits on slide average deposits increased billion or compared to the third quarter largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus and seasonality related to public funds we were also able to help our clients along their financial journey through our industryleading child tax credit awareness initiative through this initiative which promotes savings and financial confidence clients and communities most in need were able to grow their savings and ira balances by and respectively from may through december i think this is a great example of what we call purposeful growth but we know we could do more and as guided by our purpose we have been reinventing a new checking account experience that aligns with our clients needs which we believe will provide them more flexibility lower cost and more financial confidence truist one banking will be our new flagship differentiated and disruptive suite of checking solutions that redefine everyday banking and accelerate our journey towards purposeful growth truist one will have zero overdraft fees a capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need via a simple negative balance buffer as well as a deposit base credit line limit of up to these features will help clients manage their liquidity needs far more costeffectively than alternative products youre going to learn more about these details right after this call these solutions will be available to all clients this summer given our need to first finish the conversion in addition truist will discontinue overdraft protection negative account balance and return item fees in the coming months for all existing accounts long term this is a winwin for all of our stakeholders as well increase client acquisition particularly next gen clients enhance deposit growth and simply improve the overall client experience in the near term however there will be a financial cost both as the result of the introduction of truist one and the reduction of other fees we expect these changes collectively to result in an approximately million or an almost reduction in overdraft related revenue by the impact will begin in a few months and build over time as more clients benefits from the truist one experience im now going to turn it over to daryl to review our financial performance in more detail daryl n bible chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you bill and good morning everyone turning to slide net interest income was up slightly versus the prior quarter and ahead of our guidance of down the increase was primarily driven by larger securities portfolio as a result of ongoing deposit growth which offset the expected decline in purchase accounting accretion net interest margin and core net interest margin performed in line with our guidance reported net interest margin declined basis points basis points due to purchase accounting accretion and basis points from core the main drivers of the basis points decline in core net interest margin were the impacts of lower ppp revenue and higher levels of liquidity the ppp continues to wind down and we expect to earn an additional million of ppp revenue over the coming two quarters moving to slide overall truist intentionally maintained a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk enhancing current earnings while being in position to take advantage of higher rates both at the short and long ends of the curve we estimate a 100basispoint ramp increase in rates would increase nii by a 100basis point shock would increase nii by approximately of this reported asset sensitivity is from the short end of the curve truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 as a rule of thumb basis points fed hike with a beta would increase net interest income by million per month and increase net interest income margin basis points all else being equal moving to slide reported fees were down from last quarter largely due to changes in our nonqualified plans absent the impacts of the nonqualified plan fees performed well and were consistent with the guidance of relatively stable the driving factors of a stable performance quarteroverquarter were investment banking and trading increased million versus the prior quarter due to higher syndication fees structured real estate and record ma results insurance income increased million primarily due to organic growth and seasonal improvement from the third to fourth quarter these quarterly increases were offset by a decline in other income of million or million excluding changes in the nonqualified plan largely driven by the valuation adjustments for the visa related derivative and lower revenue from our sbic funds for the full year excluding security gains fees were up versus the prior year of more than million propelled by our diverse business model favorable market conditions and truist increasing size scale and relevance across multiple businesses were also making good progress early in our irm initiative particularly connectivity between ccb wealth and cib insurance income increased yearoveryear primarily driven by a very strong organic growth of and acquisitions this was our 99th year of insurance business our best one yet and we believe that our 100th year can be even better investment banking and trading was also up over million largely due to record performances of syndicated finance ma equity structured real estate and asset securitization ma revenue doubled relative to and the lead syndication rose and and syndicated finance were up yearoveryear both reflecting our strategic relevance to our clients on the flip side residential mortgage income was down yearoveryear million or primarily due to the sharp decline on gain on sale margins and lower refinance activity turning to slide reported expenses were billion for the quarter including million of mergerrelated costs and million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger adjusted expenses decreased sequentially at the end of our guidance of down to drivers for the decline include decreased personnel costs which were a result of lower salary expenses lower incentive costs lower medical claims and changes in the nonqualified plan average ftes declined including service finance from the prior quarter adjusted expenses also declined due to elevated equipment and marketing expenses in the third quarter full year adjusted expenses were up only despite the adjusted fee income growing yearoveryear this limited increase demonstrates the cost saving success we have achieved throughout the year and our overall discipline and expense management moving to slide asset quality remains excellent reflecting our prudent risk culture diverse portfolio favorable economic conditions and the effects of stimulus our net chargeoff ratio increased to basis points from basis points in the third quarter due to seasonality and the consumer losses and lesser commercial recoveries our alll coverage ratio decreased to which is just below our cecl day levels resulting in a provision benefit of million in the fourth quarter as the economic scenarios continue to improve truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 continuing on slide capital and liquidity levels remained very strong our cet1 ratio declined from to driven by organic loan growth share repurchases and the service finance acquisition our established nearterm target for cet1 of has not changed although the ratio declined to in the fourth quarter we anticipate being somewhat below our or cet1 target in the near term given the improving loan growth outlook and the cecl phasein for the first quarter we also do not anticipate repurchasing any share for the first half of moving to slide we achieved major milestone in october with the successful migration of our bbt retail and commercial clients to the truist ecosystem we have three significant integration milestones remaining completing the truist digital first migration finalizing the remaining of branch consolidations in the first quarter and the migration of our suntrust retail and commercial clients to the truist ecosystem which will occur in february the visual culmination of this process will be more truist signs across our markets at branches atms retail and corporate offices finally allowing us to serve as one brand for our clients once the integration is complete and all the systems have been converted truist will be a much simpler company to operate allowing us to provide even better service to our clients turning to slide we continue to be committed to achieving our billion of net cost saves and continue to make progress in each of the five categories thirdparty spend is down from baseline levels exceeding our targeted reduction of our sourcing team continues to make great strides in achieving savings despite the impacts of inflation and the good news is there are a fewer contracts to renegotiate in due to the higher volume of contracts renegotiated during truist first two years we are on track to deliver over total branch closures by the first quarter of and were about of the way towards our nonbranch facility reduction target average ftes are down since the merger excluding acquisitions additionally technology savings will materialize after redundant systems are decommissioned the second half of turning to slide core noninterest expense was billion in the fourth quarter meeting our target for the quarter as a reminder core noninterest expense is more comparable to our baseline expenses at the time the merger closed going forward we will focus primarily on adjusted expenses and not core as adjusted expenses represent what we believe will be the run rate going forward i will now provide guidance for the full year and for the first quarter in we expect total revenue to grow to from as a result of higher noninterest income combined with solid growth in fees the lower end of the range reflects two fed hikes with one in june and the second in december where the upper end reflects three to four rate hikes throughout the year this guidance includes the initial financial impact from the new truist one account and related fee reductions in adjusted noninterest expense is expected to only increase to in as a result of inflation increased investments and expenses from acquisitions in partially offset by the ongoing cost savings including achieving our final costsave target in the fourth quarter of mergerrelated and restructuring costs and incremental operating expenses related to the merger are anticipated to be approximately million in with these expenses going away in given these factors we anticipate positive operating leverage on both a gaap and adjusted basis in this is the primary metric we will hold ourselves accountable to this year we also expect net chargeoffs ratio to be between and basis points in given favorable economic conditions and the assumptions for normalization throughout the year with some quartertoquarter variability truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 excluding discrete items we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately and if you model us on a taxableequivalent basis looking into the first quarter we expect total revenues to decline approximately to from fourth quarter levels given two fewer days lower purchase accounting accretion and ppp revenue continued pressures on mortgage and the typical seasonal patterns in certain fee categories like payments and service charges this will partially offset by seasonality and insurance reported net interest margin should be down a couple basis points due to lower purchase accounting accretion although we expect core to be relatively flat we expect adjusted expenses to increase to next quarter from the fourth quarter levels partially due to the seasonality and personnel expense given fica and 401k and partially due to higher marketing expense as we continue to roll out the truist brand post conversions now ill turn it back to bill to conclude william henry rogers chief executive officer director truist financial corp thank you daryl slide is our investment thesis which is built on four pillars or themes that we believe truly differentiate truist and allow us to inspire and build better lives and communities as well as deliver purposeful growth for all of our stakeholders i also think its the same reason ive got the best job in banking i shared color on this refreshed investment thesis with many of you in december so on slide and in summary and conclusion truist had a very good highlighted by improved financial performance strong fee income from our diverse business model significant capital deployment and strong risk management as evidenced by our excellent asset quality metrics we also made substantial integration progress taking many significant steps towards becoming one truist as we look into our formula is going to be simple first well complete the merger in the first quarter eliminate merger related costs by year end and achieve our cost saves all of which will help us produce positive operating leverage second we will begin to pivot from an integration focus to an operating focus on executional excellence and growth the momentum we have going into combined with being one truist across all dimensions technology digital brand products process gives me great confidence in our performance and potential as we make and complete this pivot lastly well have the capacity to deploy more capital on behalf of our clients and shareholders as integration risks subside and the economy stays on sound footing so with that let me turn it back over to ankur for qa ankur vyas executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp thanks bill jake at this time if you will explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session as you do that i would like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one followup so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 question and answer section operator yes operator instructions and we will begin with ken usdin with jefferies ankur vyas a executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp ken are you there operator and ken you might be muted were not hearing anything from ken well move to the next caller in queue matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp hey matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i was hoping to follow up on the expense guidance of to growth on adjusted basis theres obviously some puts and takes with the cost saves and the service finance what are you thinking about underlying expense growth i think daryl you talked about back in november and is that still true or how do we think about that daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah matt i think we were at the conference in the ph fourth quarter we said we would have around inflation thats about million what were ballparking for us for next year we have the benefit obviously of having our third tranche of costsaves coming through in which really makes the adjusted expense growth pretty moderate versus not having those costsaves matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just remind us the lift from service finance on the cost side starting in a million a quarter daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 about million a quarter matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay all right thank you operator john pancari with evercore isi has the next question john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp hi whats up john pancari q analyst evercore isi on your revenue guide of to maybe could you just help us figure out how that would break down if you can unpack that by net interest income versus fees maybe give us little bit of color how we should think about growth in on those fronts thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah john so if you look at my prepared remarks we talk about net interest income we really right now have in our base forecast only two fed increases one in june and one in december thats the lower end of the revenue guide obviously if you look at the forwards markets where they are today its i think times so almost four fed moves factored in that would get us to the higher end of the curve we gave you a couple metrics were using a beta in our rate sensitivity and the beta equates to about million per month for every fed increase that we have there if you look back historically and look at the recession that we had and when fed started to raise rates in and the betas for the first basis points were and were modeling so i think were little bit conservative on that side well see how things play out we are modeling a higher beta when you go up over basis points to the next ph or basis points and then anything over basis points were at a beta is kind of the assumptions were using on the fee side we feel pretty indiscernible growth on the fee side we had momentum there we had a tremendous year in we still think we will continue to have pretty good pullthrough of revenue with the exception of mortgage just because of lower spread and volumes william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp so john the simplest way to think about it is the sort of assumes a flattish kind of nii and the upside of it the to is in the nii and the balance of the growth is noninterest income truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks bill its helpful and daryl thanks for that and separately on the loan growth side i want to see if you could give just expectations how we should think about the pace of growth in and maybe also for that as well how that would break down in terms of commercial versus consumer trends thanks william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah john maybe ill do a little sort of where we are and what the jumpingoff point is to put a little context around that as you well know loan growth is a function of production utilization paydowns and pipelines is the way that i would like to think about the formula in its most simple way and as we finished the fourth quarter we really saw the production start to increase utilization was up about points which was thats the first time wed seen a swing in the utilization front and that was pretty universal so we felt good about that from a momentum standpoint paydowns were up a little bit but maybe most importantly is the pipelines were at really really high levels so our ccb pipeline our cib pipeline and our cre pipeline all were at historically sort of high levels compared to the quarter and compared to this time last year usually this time of the year were starting to clean out pipelines and sort of trying to refresh in the first quarter so we entered this with a little more confidence and momentum than maybe we have in the past on the consumer side we have some headwinds from student loan but that was really just less purchases available so i mean i think thats sort of a little bit of a conscious kind of decision and then home equity which i think just is a symbol of sort of how people want to borrow in the future but remember things like service finance are coming on we completed that purchase in early december so we will sort of get the benefit of that on the consumer side as we come through so in terms of thinking about the whole year and thinking about the puts and takes i think sort of a midsingle digit from here kind of growth rate based upon everything we know now nothing else changing so on and so forth i think is sort of eminently achievable and i think reflective of the momentum we have right now john pancari q analyst evercore isi great bill thanks for all that color very helpful william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp sure operator and we have ken usdin with jefferies back in the queue go ahead ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc oh thanks good morning guys hey just wanted to come back on that expense trajectory and how you kind of take us from here to there i heard the points about the to underlying growth off the end of the year you also said youre on track to get the full costsaves can you kind of talk us through after the conversion when do you get to that that run rate numbers still the fourth quarter and any update that you might have in terms of just that gross versus net and if youre doing any better on the either side versus your original expectations thanks truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so ken as ive said before our trajectory on expenses is not just down every quarter it moves up and down obviously we got some seasonal factors going from fourth to first with fica and 401k and then we are building our marketing budget and basically rolling out our truist brand across the whole footprint pretty aggressively to build brand awareness i think as the quarter and years play out i think youre going to see expenses maybe pick up a little bit and then as we get through all the technology decommissioning thats probably the biggest costsaves to still come through thats really backend loaded right now we still have branches that will go away early in the quarter but for the most part other real estate and technology savings are probably the biggest savings which will be towards the end of the quarter and we feel really good about still hitting our target that we originally set when we announced the merger william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah and one other point id add i think daryl was making this earlier this also covers the investments that were making so we have this unique opportunity and that weve got costsaves ahead of us but ability to cover not only the inflation pressures but also our investments in talent our investment in technology the ability to grow our businesses thats all factored into this guidance daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah if you look at the investments were making this quarter versus last year its probably double what it was so were actually investing more in the company and still achieving our costsaves ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood thanks and just a second question you talked about insurance being better this year the january renewals were im just wondering if you could you help us understand what the growth outlook is for the insurance business given you have the midyear acquisitions you had in addition to the organic growth outlook thanks william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah ken if its okay ill let john sort of hit that directly john m howard a chief insurance officer truist financial corp thanks bill id say that the environment for insurance continues to be favorable so when you think about it from a pricing standpoint you mentioned the january renewals those were largely around reinsurance pricing and they vary by class of business but it remains a favorable environment for insurance pricing we continue to see exposure growth we continue to see very strong statistics in new business and retention so we expect strong performance in insurance in operator well now hear from gerard cassidy with rbc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning bill good morning daryl william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you now share with us obviously your cet1 ratio you lowered the nearterm targeted ratio to from what is the longer term once the deal the integration is completed or in heading out further what do you guys think is longterm cet1 ratio for you folks william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp gerard i think as weve said before i mean were going to continue to look at sort of where we are in our merger integration where the economy is the health of our business and make those adjustments on an ongoing basis and this wont be a quarterly kind of thing but just as we see significant shifts in those criteria evidenced by the fact we went from to and also the fact that weve got flexibility i mean the good news for us we had loan growth at the end of the quarter that probably exceeded our expectations and that took our cet1 a little below that target which we think is great by the way thats sort of a highclass way to go below that target so as we go through the process this year we go through to the ccar process look at all the stress testing results i think sometimes toward the middle or the end part of this year well take another harder look and be more communicative about where another goal might be gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and then as a followup im trying to figure out on the fourth quarter call for next january whats going to be the real subject of discussions for you folks and maybe your peers obviously were not going to be talking about restructuring costs and things like that because it will be finally over for you folks but credit is something that im wondering about because its so good today we all know that and i dont know if clarke can comment on this but im curious when you look at your underwriting standards today i dont know if you want to use a scale of to being very conservative being very aggressive where does it stand versus where it was at the start of the pandemic and then where it was versus and then second whats going on with your competition are they being really aggressive you guys seeing really aggressive underwriting from some of your peers thank you clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp hey gerard thats great question i would say for truist weve removed all our covidrelated overlays that we added in from our underwriting standpoint as the pandemic hit so i would say were underwriting more or less at a normal through the cycle rate so right in the middle of the field were not on the aggressive end were not on the conservative end i think were leading the market through our longterm approach truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 obviously its very competitive out there there are aggressive structures and pricing considerations that we have to deal with every day but i think our view is that because of our diverse business model and then particularly in our lending segments we can get responsible growth by through the cycle approach so i would say for us were in a pretty normal approach albeit watching those areas that might have been impacted structurally by the pandemic cre office things like that but otherwise for us its more normal underwriting gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator mike mayo with wells fargo securities has the next question mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just a specific question as relates to competition whats been the retention rate of your employees customers deposits when the merger was announced three years ago there was a lot of talk about competitors gaining share and i am just wondering what specific metrics you have around that william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp sure mike ill take a crack at that obviously thats extremely high focus area for us so if we start with deposit and clientside i would say its been exceptional and exceeded our expectations the branch closures retention numbers have been really in the high high i think its just a reflection of clients confidence in us our presence in the market and our ability to handle their needs whether its digital or whether its physical so i think so that part has been exceptional exceeded probably all expectations and the same thing on the we see in the deposit growth so i mean i think were those are hard numbers looking at market share but i feel like were taking share in that sense because in that in that retention model as it moves to teammates i think you and i had talked about this right into the first year of the merger our retention numbers were actually higher for truist than they were compared to each heritage company so our teammates had voted for the merger and wanting to be part of that and we look at not only overall retention we look at high performer retention retention we divide it up a lot of different ways obviously that attrition has picked up and thats picked up across the industry i still think on a relative basis we look really strong from that standpoint and if you think about whats going to happen to us we also changed the denominator a bit when we closed a lot of branches and were still consolidating so our ability i think to stay ahead of the attrition game i think were really really well positioned from that standpoint truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 but also and may be equally importantly is our attractiveness to hire talent has never been better i mean we are bringing in some fantastic people that want to be part of our company they bought into our purpose they love the idea of being on a strong legacy company that feels like a startup so its got sort of a nice combination to it our commitment and capacity to innovate make investments has been really attractive so our retention numbers i mean our attrition numbers are up there is no doubt about that in the last year everybody else is i think on a relative basis were okay we manage it to an absolute though thats the way i think about it and our ability to attract talents really really strong never been stronger mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right and as far as the followup im going to have a windup to my second question here its been almost three years since you announced the merger your stocks up the bank index is up the sp is up so you have woefully underperformed from the stock standpoint and that coincides with a period when youve shown some negative operating leverage especially last year and youve talked about this the pandemic slowed down the merger conversions nii has been depressed youve had a cautious approach you wanted best of breed and so we have all that so really getting to positive operating leverage this year youre doubling the investment but i just want to know if we can have additional reassurance that operating leverage will be more positive than say basis point because you say to revenue growth to expense growth so that could be anywhere from basis point to basis points and this merger was predicated on overlapping footprints benefits of technology that seems like youre spending a lot of the savings and that investors arent seeing that to the bottom line so can you just give any assurance or maybe not as far as the positive operating leverage this year and the payback from these investments while as you say the hood is open william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah i mean i think the commitment to positive operating leverage is clear in our guidance related to how much we achieve i think given weve had a pretty conservative forecast on the rate increases if we get additional rate increases this was predicated the in your lineup was predicated on two rate increases if we get more those sort of follow straight through to the bottom line so we create more operating leverage but also i think to your point and the point i made earlier were continuing to invest in this business i mean were not going to achieve operating leverage positive operating leverage and starve our business i mean the ability to achieve the costsaves redeploy them into the appropriate investments from a long term that was the vision of truist i mean that was the premise upon which we established this merger and i think arguably and i hard to dispute its taken a little bit longer some of those were decisions we made the best of both was a little more expensive than we had anticipated at the outset but i think youre really starting to see and i can feel you can feel it in the pivot in the fourth quarter you can feel it in the pivot in our guidance the promise of truist is manifesting itself in not only positive operating leverage but purposeful growth and ability to invest in the business for the long term yes were committed to positive operating leverage underlined exclamation point and all the other comments but in a way that were continuing to invest to grow our business for the long term truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp hey mike the only thing else i would add to that if you look at our net interest income just to remind you we have runoff of purchase accounting accretion about million planned for yearoveryear and we have about million runoff indiscernible planned to be lower year over year so for us just to be flat ph and nii is the guidance that we gave for our revenue growth indiscernible net interest income being up maybe a little bit maybe on a gaap basis but thats really if you look at the real true operations of the company and potentially up to maybe if we get rate increases and maybe some more loan growth so the company is really performing at high levels from a production basis on the amount of volume that were putting through on the asset side of the equation mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks for that clarification thank you operator well now hear from john mcdonald with autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning bill wanted to ask you little bit more of a industry question with the loan demand and loan growth numbers looking better across the industry whats happening in the psychology of the borrower here feels like there is still a liquidity out there but there is a change going on is it more confidence about the economy folks just have run into a need to build inventories why are we seeing this increase in loan demand across the industry william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah i think its a combination of things john i mean when im out visiting with clients demand is never the issue for business i mean they all have demand and that cuts across actually a wide swath of industries and geographic locations so the ability to do business i think youre seeing a couple things one is i think what your premise was in your question people building a little inventory sort of anticipating trying to get ahead some of the supply chain i think you see that then you just see stuff happening like in the dealer side cars are showing up ph on lots they may be showing up ph on lots needing a chip or whatever it may be but theyre showing up so the ability to borrow against those capacities and then i think people are just making the decisions to move forward deploying capital theyve had plans if theyve delayed plans theyre continuing to look at the current omicron as potentially a shortterm situation that reverses itself and they dont want to get behind theyre all in competitive situations so i think they are deploying capital against the opportunities that theyve had planned for the several years so i think its a combination of lot of things it is just resiliency of the economy and a little bit of positioning to get one step ahead of both supply chains wage pressure whatever it may be and the competition truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay got it and then just a followup for daryl on the revenue outlook for this year first how much of that million impact from the truist one and overdraft how much of that gets felt in daryl and then also just on the overall revenue guide could you just give us the base for the revenues that million or something like that for this year that you are growing to off of thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so ill do your latter question first the base for revenue is million john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay yeah daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp its kind of the base i would grow off of and then for the truist one recall in bills remarks its probably going to start in the second quarter and its probably anywhere from a third to of the impact would be in probably spread out evenly over the second third and fourth quarter and then kind of builds up in and then the full run rate in of million john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay got it thank you operator next up we have ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just wanted to follow up bill on your comments around operating leverage i think the promise of the deal partly was the benefit of scale as we look beyond this year just structurally when we look at the efficiency ratio i think were about right now do you see the bank actually being a low efficiency ratio franchise over the next two to four years or given the investment spend that youve talked about its going to be hard to make that move absent the meaningfully higher interest rate backdrop truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2022 william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah its a good question and to the latter part of your question there is some rate dependency normalization of rate dependency to get to that lower efficiency ratio yeah we wont make as much move on that in the next year but our efficiency ratio on a relative basis i think will continue to be industry leading so i think the ability to invest in our business do it in a way that to your point that the scale achieve much more efficient company i think well be able to continue that progress and then if we get some sort of normalization of rates i think looking out over two and threeyear period i think the low is a reasonable target in a normalized kind of rate environment daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp the thing i would add ebrahim what i said on mikes call the runoff of the purchase accounting accretion gets easier year after year so the ability to drive positive operating leverage will get easier as we go out two three or four years ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess on the revenue side with the systems conversion done my sense would be given your scale given your history in these markets you should be playing offence where youve gained market share so bill you shared some retention numbers but talk to us about your ability to go head to head with regional smaller banks and actually gain market share as we think about the next few years and probably outperform on loan growth william henry rogers a chief executive officer director truist financial corp yeah maybe just to clarify the first part of your question we have been on offence so i think its just the ability to be further on offence and to accentuate that capability if you look at virtually all of our categories if you think about insurance as an example relative to insurance if you think about our investment banking relative to investment banking if you think about deposit growth loan growth client acquisition digital adoption whatever measures you want to choose on a relative basis i mean i feel like were already gaining share and i think to your point our capacity to gain share our competitiveness the breadth and depth of our product capability the talent that we have on the field the training that they are receiving the way they work together in integrated relationship management the way that they allow all cylinders of the company to benefit the client weve just never been more competitive and against small against regional against large i think all the things that we wanted to see and feel from truist are absolutely coming to bear and on the field every day ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you ankur vyas a executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp jake we have got time for one more question operator and we
