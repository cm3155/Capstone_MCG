which reflects our diverse business mix our consistent risk management we did have a negative provision and importantly i would point out investments that we have made in insurance investment banking wealth and digital capabilities and excellent progress in our conversion as youve heard us say before we believe culture continues to be the primary driver of our success i will point out that today in these times our purpose really resonates with teammates and others as our purpose of inspiring and building better lives and communities is motivational and satisfying to our teammates being involved and helping make the world a better place were now focused you may be interested in knowing and helping each of our teammates align with our culture on a personal basis because we find that engagement really excels when people are aligned with a personal purpose and a cultural purpose our eo team is highly focused on cultural integration and activation and is a primary focus for all of us if youre following the slides if you look on slide just want to point out that for us purpose is not just a banner its the way we live its truly trying to inspire and build better lives and communities we focused a lot of attention especially now and increasing on dei i would point out some of the major investments were making in our communities example this quarter we contributed a combined million to the truist foundation and the truist charitable fund to support important work of our organizations across our diverse markets and communities were very excited that we were able to invest million in atlantas mercy care which is a fantastic federally qualified health care for homeless program we expanded our partnership with operation hope with a million investment to help provide more education insights and tools to help more people build better lives and we invested million in a grant to the national institute for student success to improve the financial education and graduation rates for underserved students this is a fantastic program but its not just about philanthropy its about the way we live around here every day so im very proud that we released our inaugural supplier diversity impact report which outlined a billion total economic impact through supplier diversity relationships in were at prorated on our goal for our threeyear billion community benefit plan which is really helping our communities and through second quarter weve originated about billion of ppp loans which really have supported our business clients and employees and our communities were very active and increasing our engagement with regard to esg very focused on energy and sustainable related financing where in the second quarter continuing from weve invested billion in clean energy truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 and sustainable related financing look forward soon in the next few weeks for the second truist csr and esg report which i think you will enjoy so now if youll flip with us to slide i just want to point out some of the key performance highlights with a very strong quarter we had taxable equivalent revenue of billion which was up a strong sequentially from first quarter we had billion in taxable equivalent we had the revenue and net income was billion which was up linked very proud of our diluted eps which was up sequentially and a strong over last year return on average tangible common equity adjusted was a very strong but even if you take out the reserve release its still a really really strong which is driven by strong performance in insurance investment banking wealth card and payment fees and our commercial real estate related income we had strong performance in terms of revenue as i said it did drive a increase in adjusted noninterest expenses due to incentives but frankly this is exactly the kind of expense increase we like to have when you put that together revenue and expenses we had a solid adjusted operating leverage of and our adjusted ppnr was billion up compared to last quarter our asset quality is great we performed well in ccar which allowed us to be in a position to propose a increase in our dividend we record per quarter our merger integration is going very very well and top performance and improved economic conditions give us confidence to reduce our cet1 target to and daryl will talk more about that so our total performance for the quarter we think was very very strong and very comprehensive which we feel very very good about if you flip with us to slide i just want to point out a few of the selected items that impacted adjusted income first we had mergerrelated and restructuring charges of million million aftertax which was a diluted impact of incremental operating expenses related to the merger ill point out again these are merger related expenses but dont meet the technical definition of mergerrelated and restructuring charges but they are not in our run rate going forward thats million million again aftertax and diluted negative impact as i mentioned we did have a million contribution to our truist foundation and truist charitable fund which had an impact i would point out in the mergerrelated and restructuring charges included in that is a million aftertax accrual related to our voluntary separation and retirement program which was a program that we offered in june we had approximate teammates that elected to participate these were totally voluntary decisions on their part and i want to really thank and appreciate those teammates for their commitment and support to help us build a foundation of truist this program does help us reduce cost and create capacity to invest in needed services for our clients its really part of our overall intense focus on reconceptualizing our businesses to thrive in todays world requires a deep commitment to continuously reevaluating yesterdays activities and expenses associated with that so that we can afford to invest in new activities for todays demands with that let me turn it to bill to talk about some indiscernible our key trends william henry rogers jr president chief operating officer director truist financial corp thank you kelly and good morning everybody as you can see on slide we continue to experience robust demand for digital banking services as our clients look for more convenient and more effective ways to transact and manage their finances the pace of digital adoption has been especially rapid and mobile since the second quarter of our active user base has increased by to over million active clients truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 ph beyond the digital growth stories its a lot more than that it isnt just one dimensional in addition to growing active users were deepening our relationships as we accompany clients along their digital journey by providing the premier digital experience we build trust with our clients they then entrust us to facilitate a broader range of transactions a great example of this is in mobile payments where zelle transactions were up compared to a year ago were also excited about the rollout of our new digital experience thats beginning now ahead of our physical conversion after completing a successful internal pilot were beginning to migrate the truist digital offering to a small number of clients rollout will happen in a series of waves throughout the back half of the year we anticipate that up to million clients could be on the digital platform by the end of this month with more to be added in each successive wave on the right you can see just one example of how were using digital to meet clients where they are in the small business space a single signon focus for clients with personal and business accounts is a significant benefit allowing our small business clients to toggle back and forth seamlessly between their business and personal finances our clients will also be able to customize their dashboard and notifications so they can focus on what matters to them in addition our fraud detection technology will help small business clients with fraudulent transactions for a more secure banking experience the attractiveness of our overall approach is that weve created a common platform for retail wealth and small business which creates agility and a seamless client experiences but the experiences are tailored and designed for the unique needs of each client segment now allow me move to slide indiscernible loan growth remained challenging in the second quarter given strong liquidity levels in the marketplace and amongst our clients supply chain disruptions and low levels of rates which are driving high levels of refinance activity average loans decreased billion compared to the first quarter driven by billion decline in commercial loans and a billion decline in residential mortgages average ci balances decreased billion reflecting a billion impact from ppp forgiveness and billion from lower dealer floor plan outstandings nevertheless were encouraged about potential green shoots in ci excluding the impacts of ppp and dealer floor plan ci loans grew modestly due to an increase in production and stable utilization late in the quarter several of our markets in specialty saw growth particularly middle market june production in corporate institutional group was the highest its been since the merger and june production in the commercial community bank was the highest its been in months if you exclude april which was obviously unusual due to elevated line draws our revolver exposure continued to grow by month evidence of our relevance and that our clients are building capacity for investments or expansion average consumer loans decreased billion as a result of ongoing refinance activity in our residential mortgage and home equity and direct portfolios residential mortgages held for investment decreased billion as prepayment speeds remained elevated despite some moderation from first quarter levels were expanding our correspondent capacity and transferring some correspondent production to held for investment to support future growth we also believe prepayment speeds will continue to moderate indirect remains a bright spot due to growth in our prime marine rv portfolios and lightstream overall loan growth remained elusive in the second quarter both for the industry and for truist as indicated earlier though were seeing evidence of things beginning to turn and our execution is improving at truist with a keen focus on balance sheet diversity and prudent risk management longterm loan growth is an output and truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 highly correlated to economic growth and we firmly believe the economy particularly in our key markets is on a very solid footing and on an expansion trajectory allow me turn to slide average deposits increased compared to the first quarter largely due to the continuing effects of recent government stimulus we experienced strong deposit inflows while maximizing our value proposition to clients outside of rate paid as average total deposit cost decreased basis point sequentially to basis points more importantly truist continues to resonate with clients during the second quarter we had a record personal checking account production and added more than net new accounts which attest to the strength of our franchise we also do an excellent job retaining clients as attrition rates from recently closed branches continue to be significantly more favorable than planned we believe these favorable client dynamics reflect our robust markets strong digital commerce production and solid execution by our teammates in the retail community bank and with that daryl let me turn it over to you for our financial performance daryl n bible chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you and good morning everyone continuing on slide net interest income decreased million largely due to million lower purchase accounting accretion net interest margin decreased basis points lower purchase accounting accretion was basis points headwind core net interest margin decreased basis points due to the continued build of excess liquidity which was approximately billion this quarter as well as the impact of persistent low rate environment asset sensitivity increased modestly due to the increase in dda and the favorable deposit mix changes partially offset by the increase in the investment portfolio i would also note almost of our asset sensitivity is from the short end of the curve giving us solid upside when shortterm rates begin to rise continuing on slide our diverse business mix is a key strength and continues to provide revenue momentum in a low rate environment adjusted noninterest income grew sequentially and yearoveryear driven by record results in multiple fee businesses insurance income was a record million driven by a strong organic growth in new business excellent retention rates and a firm pricing market organic revenue grew versus a covidimpacted like quarter and we continue to forecast very healthy organic growth given the various uncertainties that exist in the marketplace this is clearly a good time to be in a business that helps clients manage risk fee income from investment banking reflected strong results in syndicated finance and ma while trading income was offset by million swing in the cva we have been consistently investing in and building our corporate and investment banking business for over years and this quarters results are a reflection of that record cre income was driven by strong structured real estate transaction activity our strong performance is also a testament to the cre teams experience and deep client relationships other income benefited from valuation gains on our longstanding partnerships related to our sbic funds and also investments weve made through our truist ventures unit when small businesses win our communities win so we are thrilled with the success we have had over many years with our sbic program continuing on slide interest expense increased million from the prior quarter drivers included a million charitable contribution to the truist foundation and truist charitable fund to support our purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities in addition mergerrelated and restructuring charges and truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 incremental operating expenses increased million largely due to the voluntary separation and retirement program that kelly mentioned earlier adjusted noninterest expense increased modestly due to higher variable compensation related to the stronger performance of our fee businesses and overall strong corporate performance adjusted noninterest expense was also favorable relative to adjusted revenue growth driving sequential positive operating leverage this quarter turning to slide asset quality remains excellent reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse portfolio as well as a stronger economy nonperforming assets decreased basis points net chargeoffs decreased basis points to basis points a pro forma postfinancial crisis low lower chargeoffs reflect improvements in our indirect auto and ci portfolios as well as an uptick in recoveries our alll remained strong at with excellent coverage ratios due to the improved economic outlook our provision was a negative million and released million of reserves continuing on slide capital remained strong our cet ratio increased to our total payout ratio was and included million of share repurchases we continue to optimize our capital stack by redeeming our series h preferred stock our latest ccar results reflect our prudent risk management and resiliency under stress truist had the second lowest loss rate in our peer group as well as above average stress ppnr relative to peers our preliminary stress capital buffer was reduced to from our strong ccar results improving economy and merger progress provide additional capital flexibility our board will consider proposal to increase the dividend by to per share in its july meeting we also intend to manage to approximately cet1 ratio over the near term which will reflect approximately billion to billion of potential capital deployment either through repurchases or acquisitions over the next five quarters turning to slide we are making steady progress in our integration plan and our risk profile improves with each conversion during the second quarter we successfully converted our wealth trust platform we are very proud of our wealth digital and technology teammates for their hard work in completing this conversion and brokerage platform conversion in february more impressively our advisors continue to produce positive net organic asset flows which combined with strong market conditions produced excellent results in wealth management fee income we also performed extensive testing to prepare for the upcoming core bank conversions after each milestone we reflect on what weve learned apply those learnings to the future integration activities this reduces the risk and helps us ensure we get better with each step of the integration as you look to the third quarter much of our focus will be on the final preparations for the conversion of our heritage bbt clients to the truist ecosystem later this year this will be followed by heritage suntrust conversion in the first quarter of continuing on slide we are committed to achieving billion of net cost saves and continue to make progress across those five categories thirdparty spend is down versus the baseline and now exceeds our revised target of in retail banking we remain at cumulative branch closures and are on track to achieve approximately total closures by the first quarter of including closures we are expecting in july nonbranch facility space is down million square feet and were closing in on our target of million we appreciate all the hard work our teammates have done to keep us on track to achieve these goals average ftes decreased since the merger announcement and would decline even further given the vsrp program technology savings will materialize after redundant systems are decommissioned in we are also making critical investments in digital and technology since the merger closed we have doubled our digital agile teams truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 and tripled our total agile teams which makes us nimbler and improves our speed to market enhancing our client experience turning to slide we still expect to incur total merger costs of approximately billion through we have incurred cumulative merger costs of billion through the second quarter reflecting considerable integration work on slide looking ahead we expect these costs to decrease significantly after our first quarter core bank conversion and then drop off entirely after continuing on slide our core noninterest expense was billion in the second quarter this calculation removes the effects from asset value changes for our retirement plans our insurance acquisitions and higher variable compensation due to fee income and corporate performance this makes it much more comparable to the baseline expenses at the time the merger closed based on the trajectory of our ongoing cost save initiatives we are on track to achieve our fourth quarter core expense target of billion we are fully committed to this target and we are confident in our ability to meet it now id provide guidance for the third quarter we expect total net interest income to be relatively stable versus linked quarter as one additional day combined with moderate loan growth excluding ppp offsets declines in purchase accounting accretion and ppp revenue core net interest margin is expected to be relatively stable however reported net interest margin will continue to decline as a result of diminishing purchase accounting accretion fees should remain healthy given investments weve made in our businesses robust market conditions and continued economic recovery it will not be as strong as second quarter performance this is partially due to insurance seasonality but we would expect solid growth compared to third quarter of last year adjusted expenses should be relatively flat linked quarter but would decline in fourth quarter as lower personnel costs are realized from the vsrp program we expect the net chargeoff ratio to be basis points to basis points given the continued strength in the economy also if the strong credit quality performance continues we would expect further reductions in our loan loss allowance ratio overall we had excellent operating quarter as strong fee income more than offset modest lower spread income and outpaced expenses to drive sequential operating leverage now let me hand it over to kelly to discuss our value proposition kelly s king chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp just to make a couple comments with regard to our value proposition this quarter focusing on our markets and capital we are really very very pleased that of our net new accounts are opened by new households we think this shows market share gains and migration in our markets and our digital advantage as about half of our new accounts are opened online all of this interestingly is happening in the face of large number of branch closures that daryl described where our client retention is a very strong 98plus percent which is really fantastic in any type of merger as mentioned our ccar performance our lowered risk in the economy reduced risk in our conversion process which daryl discussed gives us great confidence to propose a meaningful increase in our dividend to a record and reduce our target cet1 to just wanted to emphasize that again to make sure you get that because thats important truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 we also are very confident in achieving as daryl said our billion net cost saves based on a number of initiatives that are driving the reconceptualization of our business expense reductions and our industryleading profitability we believe that the combination of that will support our investments in future strategies and leading technology investments then finally if youd just flip to slide just want to make a couple of points that how the metrics and numbers support that value proposition as we said before we have a really exceptional franchise we have the highest projected population growth compared to our peers and our marketplaces we have really good fee income diversity with our investments in insurance investment banking and wealth we are really uniquely positioned from a profitability perspective with our adjusted diluted eps at up adjusted return on average tangible common equity at a strong and we have strong capital as daryl described as well so if you look at the quarter overall it was a strong quarter based on a strong culture great markets awesome team there are plenty of challenges out there the pandemic is getting better the economy is getting better and overall at truist we fully believe our best days are ahead ankur let me turn it back to you ankur vyas headinvestor relations truist financial corp thank you kelly before we move to qa though id like to quickly turn it to bill whod like to share a few concluding thoughts william henry rogers jr president chief operating officer director truist financial corp i might make you feel a little uncomfortable but so bear with me so given this is kellys last and 50th earnings call as ceo i just want to spend a few minutes highlighting his legacy just incredible positive impact on bbt truist the banking industry and our communities during his 49year career in banking i could take hours to do this but i wont given that we only have a few minutes but i thought this group of analysts and

forward thinker kelly is a purposedriven leader who steered bbt through tremendous change not just to survive but to thrive through the great recession multiple economic downturns and now through a

tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 thank you kelly thank you bill shannon at this time were now ready to start qa so if youll explain to our listeners how they can participate in the qa session id like to ask the participants to limit yourselves to one primary and one followup so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning kelly good morning bill kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc to start off on behalf of many on this call kelly i would also reiterate bills fabulous comments about your career and congratulate you on being an outstanding community spiritual and commercial bank leader i think you will be missed by many so congratulations on questions maybe starting with you bill can you give us some further color or elaborate on the green shoots that you guys are seeing in the loan growth area for possibly the second half of the year daryl touched on it as well and where youre seeing some of this potential growth coming from william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah sure gerard as i mentioned production in june in cig and ccb was sort of hitting some high point so we started to see a little bit of an inflection point in cig a lot of that came from industrials healthcare tech that probably doesnt surprise you i mean i think as we think about the infrastructure thats ahead of us i think energy is a potential for the future ill put that a little bit a question mark thats probably the light green of a green shoot and ccb really good progress in our middle market a lot in our verticals senior care i think thats really coming back strong our dealer network so despite the outstandings our exposure to dealer is going up and then just sort of our government services again i dont think those are surprises those are probably core parts of our economy overall revolver commitments were up so as i said earlier i think the capacity of our clients to invest when this will come i think thats sort of a question i dont think its an if i feel like were in a good position whether that manifests itself so much in the second quarter remember we still have some headwinds with ppp but our tailwinds i think the dealer part will rebound i mean youll see the supply chain start to normalize whether that happens at the end of this year or first of next year i dont know but that will rebound the economy particularly and our markets utilization and just as kelly mentioned our just core execution just gets better every day so i think those are tailwinds truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hey gerard if i may add bill and i and others have been on our regional visits virtually so far this year and weve talked i guess bill to hundreds of offshore business clients and the feedback and i think its a really big deal universally has been extremely confident and positive theyre all talking about projects that theyre working on it is as bill described beginning to show up in green shoots i personally think it will really begin to show up as we head into the third and fourth quarter and certainly under guard a strong but the confidence level is very very high christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp gerard this is chris i might just add that we had of our regions that were actually positive in ci growth less dealer gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and maybe shifting over to daryl you talked a little bit daryl about the possibility of bringing the loan loss reserve down you mentioned that in the dfast test youre the second best in terms of the on the credit losses i see if i recall your day one reserves back in january of were can you give us maybe some color and maybe clark as well about the outlook that could that reserve level fall below the day one now that the outlook might be even stronger today than it was in january of excluding the pandemic situation daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah thanks for the question gerard what i would tell you is is that when we established our cecl day one number we weighted our pessimistic scenario of i mean if you look at the economy now and the growth that were seeing and the outlook our weighting is much less than that so as the economy plays out throughout this year there is a chance that we could pierce through and maybe go over or go under our cecl day one number that we started with in january of from that perspective i think you have to take it quarterbyquarter and see how its performing but right now the economy seems to be going on really strong and any momentum gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator and our next question will come from mike mayo of wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi you dont have revenue synergies built in your final numbers but it seems like you might have some revenue synergies here so specifically im asking of the record in insurance and of the record in investment banking how truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 much of those revenues are driven by crossselling versus just the core organic growth and i have my insurance analyst colleague at wells fargo securities to ask on that second part elyse elyse greenspan q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah thanks go ahead christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp no go ahead elyse greenspan q analyst wells fargo securities llc i was just going to build upon my question on the insurance side just hoping you guys had an impressive organic growth quarter hoping to get an update on your outlook for the rest of the year how things can trend versus the this quarter indiscernible within retail and wholesale indiscernible christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp all right id be happy to do that maybe bill and ill take the irm question first and then ill jump back and answer your question elyse from the irm perspective i will tell you it is going really well we have been for the past months in the behavior building kind of phase when i look at this quarter i see very strong contributions from the commercial community bank to our strategic side which is the cig for capital market services i see a very strong up in a growth perspective i see mortgage up in the mid and cig which is back to insurance and to a few other areas up well over in terms of growth in fairness we have some other areas that have some opportunity but i like what i see and i think what were building really is the right foundation for a behavioral jumping off point across the company it is something that bill and i have been personally monitoring and working with each one of the business lines and were in kind of still of a buildout process from terms of understanding sort of whats possible and were really trying to push our line of business leaders to think bigger because we think the opportunity is very substantial and bill i dont know if theres anything you want to add to that william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah i think chris said it exactly right and remember mike i mean these cut across a lot of different parts and we like to think about the term of integrated relationship management so that it cuts across clients and were meeting clients needs and working backwards but just ill give an example sort of in the commercial community bank weve doubled the number of transactions that we did in the quarter versus last quarter and these might be where we were left lead this might be where we were in ma transaction and the pipeline is also about double where it was before so as a percent of the growth as a percent of the total its a smaller percent as a percent of the incremental growth its a larger percent and i think thats going to continue to grow the momentum the cultural alignment all the parts that we built as part of one truist i just feel i feel great about it and i think that momentum will continue and youll see it in just the way i think youll see it is versus revenue synergies specifically what youll see is incremental growth relative to ph uppers truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp yeah and so coming back elyse to your question and i just preface this with comments that we took sort of a white sheet of paper to this business back in early brought in a consultant and really begin to break the business down and look at all the opportunities to put the pieces back together and i think what youre seeing here is a threeyear end of a threeyear period of where we have really taken a lot of steps to build back a business in the most effective way possible in a really good operating environment so i would have to say this is fundamentally the best quarter i have seen in this business in my career and ive been working in this business a long time and we are by the way cranking off as we conclude the first threeyear period were kicking off another threeyear period because we think theres more that we can do and will do to improve this business but to get to your question whats really driving organic growth is as you know pricing in the industry i think probably peaked in the fourth quarter of or first quarter this year it was sort of in the up range where now if you read all the industry information coming up call it kind of range but we really believe while rates have moderated a little we believe that its still going to be very positive throughout the balance of you might have potential for a little slight moderation but we still think its very strong in the up category in the up mid to kind of category and we just entered hurricane season by the way and the fall was wildfire season so you never know it could just hold or even increase from there depending on what happens our client retention in retail is at and thats up over the last year and in a hard market environment it favors wholesale more that is very much a positive our wholesale business is its up also very strong but we are continuing to see risk shift from the standard market that supports retail to wholesale probably the most notable driver of organic growth was just our new business production and that is driven just by core gdp growth and so were in the up portion of the v right now from an economic perspective and so new business growth is double the best ive seen historically year to date were up so we get organic growth rate total growth rate of but when you strip out acquisitions organic of we are including in this quarter million of revenue from prior acquisitions that does not include constellation which we just closed on july but it includes if you look at annual run rate its about million of prior acquisitions we did through a number of seven or eight through the back half of last year and the first part of this year so thats sort of the organic growth question but to get to your outlook question just remember we are going from our seasonally strongest quarter of the year to our seasonally weakest quarter from second to third so we expect commissions to be down about going from second to third and theres still certainly uncertainties but we just think the environment looking forward is still very favorable when you think of improvement in the economy with a gdp and improving employment which really drives our eb business increasing pricing as we just said and up sort of range and then we benefit from the shift to the es market via our very strong wholesale business thats why we operate a diversified model quite frankly we think pricing is going to continue to be strong you see sort of the drivers in the industry this quarter umbrella in excess is up do is up commercial property which we have a disproportionate exposure to is up thats really good for us so we expect for the third quarter high singledigit organic growth in our weakest quarter that would be the highest growth that ive seen historically period but were expecting high singledigit growth in our weakest quarter which i think is fantastic for the business and just remember we did close constellation july and that adds million in revenue and really helps us form one of the largest programs divisions in wholesale units of any wholesale provider going forward truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great well thank you very much christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp sure operator and our next question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hey betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi chris just a quick followup on that the million is additive so your qq is not including that acquisition just want to clarify that christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp yeah no it is in our forecast so what youre typically seeing i mean last year youd have seen second to third we would drop maybe million this year you would have seen a million drop but with the addition of this number youd see something like a million because youve got million annually betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then just the expenses associated with constellation that we should be thinking about anything there to note out christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp theres expense synergies so this business actually the margin is accretive to our overall margin so i think there are expenses but there are synergies that are coming out daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp i think the operating truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp ratio initially is like for constellation if you want to add any expenses but the transaction indiscernible christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp yeah and generally betsy generally its about a 12month integration betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah no youve done a great job at improving the operating efficiency of that business over the past several years so congratulations to you on that i did have a couple other questions first off imitation is often the best form of flattery and theres plenty of people imitating you on your specialty finance lending focus that has been a hallmark of tfc for many decades could you give us a sense as to how youre thinking about that business and where you want to be leaning into growth christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist financial corp absolutely betsy and thank you for saying that that has been a focus of ours we really think of it in terms of pointofsale and when we talk about insurance in wealth and cig we probably should add sort of a pointofsale focus through our core sheffield and we also have lightstream now we have a group of partnerships that are a little bit more indirect things have clearly changed with our consumers they no longer come to their bank to purchase their items they buy it on the spot and they want it just that way and now they want it digitally just that way as well so were working on all the above and i think we have opportunities within our current business to expand verticals like hearing aids and do more in the way of trailers and that kind of thing so there are opportunities there but i think were also looking at other opportunities to expand like in the home improvement space would be a good place theres a lot going on there so its an area were really focused on and something that were really excited about and its an industry that has in the north of kind of growth rate so were very excited about the opportunity betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and then daryl just a couple for you one tickytacky one is just on the fees you mentioned down sequentially we talked about the insurance seasonality but up yearonyear could you just remind us what kind of base level fees youre looking at yearonyear cause i thought there was some onetimers in it last year i just want to make sure im on the right base truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp if you look at it versus prior year well probably be up anywhere from to range in that neighborhood we did have some other income in there from our venture capital portfolios there but to be honest with you we continue to invest in that and that continues to be part of run rate as we move forward so its going to be lumpy back and forth but it is going to be continuing to grow over time from that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thats helpful and then just on the nco ratio guide of the to basis points i think you came in this quarter around basis points or so and credit looks great so is this you being conservative with the basis points or is there something in the book that you would suggest youre expecting a little bit of a deterioration  on the ratio clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp betsy this is clark its primarily seasonality in the second half of the year we always have some seasonality uptick in some of the consumer portfolio so were assuming well have some of that normal trend and i would just also say this was an outstanding quarter we did have alltime lows in our things like our auto business we had really low ci and higher recovery so we had some really strong tailwinds this quarter but all that being said we still feel like were going to have very strong loss performance as we move forward given what we see today betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thanks so much and kelly its been phenomenal working with you over the past several decades so very much appreciate the time that you spent with us and bill looking forward to working with you more closely going forward thanks william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp great kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thank you betsy appreciate that operator and our next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i just want to circle back on the expense target for the billion i guess first a clarification does that include the impact of the insurance deals or i would assume we got to top it up for the one that just closed and maybe the others too truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah matt in our deck we have that waterfall slide where we actually take our adjusted numbers and we back out three things our nonqualified numbers we back that out we back out insurance acquisitions and run rate to try and compare back to what we looked like in and then with the huge growth that weve seen in our cig area and our wealth area and our insurance area just organic growth thats great to have those revenues but those revenues do have expenses but those are good expenses were adjusting for those as well so thats what were adjusting to to try to get back to what we looked like when we put the merger together in matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah that slide or page was very helpful but when we see the adjusted expenses will it be the billion or we have to add that million for insurance plus one that you just did daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah its going to be the number the billion will be the number on the right at the end of the waterfall thats a core expense its not a run rate number the run rate number is the adjusted number which basically backs out your merger and restructuring charges and your incremental moe that will tend to basically come down dramatically after the first quarter of next year when we finish our core bank conversions and go away totally by the end of matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay sorry so just to clarify when we see the cost base well take out the merger charges well take out the incremental cost and should we still focus will we see the core number or the adjusted number daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp the adjusted number is the run rate number on a goforward basis all core does is basically try to back out because were a dynamic company thats constantly changing and growing and doing things we have to back out our expense bases that basically have benefited over the last two years of coming together so were trying to show you that were getting the billion off of that original expense base but not penalizing us for the additional fee revenue growth that we received over the last couple years and acquisitions that weve done matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay all right that makes sense sorry to make you go through all that and then as we kind of think through next year do we take that the level annualize it and obviously you got some more cost saves coming maybe a little seasonality in but can you run rate that level and then be lower than that for next year full year daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp indiscernible billion cost saves so well get that by the end of we have a lot of things going on in the company right now besides those five bucket of savings which were making tremendous truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 progress in kelly talked about the voluntary separation and retirement program that we announced that basically we have some teammates that volunteered to go away basically the first wave of that will happen on so youll see the impact of that in the fourth quarter that will continue to come down over the next couple quarters the waves probably are three or four waves overall to get everybody that volunteered to go to exit the company and then kelly and bill talked about basically going through all of our processes and adjustments that were making to come together and get more efficiencies and scale when we came together in we knew what we knew then we know a lot more now and were continuing to make our company much more efficient and improved and well have savings from that all through but to be honest with you were creating fuel that basically would not only fall to the bottom line but were also continuing to make a lot more investments in our businesses in wealth insurance cig and other areas and were also investing in technology and digital with these savings that were getting matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator and well now hear from john mcdonald of autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah hi i wanted to follow up the new capital target daryl said creates billion billion of incremental excess capital i just was wondering bill or kelly how youre thinking about that between ma opportunities and share repurchases any thoughts you could share on that kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so john our waterfall of priorities has not changed in all these years and thats what we would think that stable longterm investors would appreciate the number one is always organic growth thats highest payback for you shareholders the second is our good stable longterm increasing dividend payout third is ma and we have good opportunities there and thats been very very encouraging and fourth is buyback and were willing to do that aggressively when its appropriate john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp and hey john just to emphasize that and kelly said it i mean and you see in our results i mean our organic opportunities are significant so what we see with our markets where we see our ability to invest so thats going to be priority one and it continues to enhance john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 okay and then just to follow up on that is it a target we should think about kind of for the next year or so is that how youre thinking about like kind of maybe moving down over the next year to that william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah i think john what weve said consistently is as the risk of the merger comes down and our confidence in the economy goes up well evaluate that target so i think were going to be on that trajectory and i mean it would be logical that our confidence is going to improve on the merger and improves every day daryl outlined a pretty good chart of the things that weve been doing and then well all look and see how the economy is doing so we dont want to ever time bound that decision its really time bound by whats happening in our company and whats happening in the general economy john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay fair enough thanks ankur vyas a headinvestor relations truist financial corp and i think weve got time for operator and our next question ankur vyas a headinvestor relations truist financial corp one more question sorry shannon operator certainly indiscernible operator thank you our final question will come from john pancari of evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning just on the ma front i know you just indicated that you see some good opportunities there could you just give us your updated thoughts on that front what type of ma are you most interested in and then separately curious to get your thoughts on president bidens executive order which seems to be implying greater scrutiny around larger bank deals i want to see if that makes you think any differently about future deals thanks william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah john on the ma side i think well be consistent with the things that weve seen i mean obviously in the insurance side weve had really good experience there and i would expect that to continue we talked in betsys question about some of the enterprise payments some of the opportunities we have there some of the pointof truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 sale i mean things that have been important to us strategically digital perhaps but things that have been important to us strategically will be consistent i mean we wont go sort of offtrack from our core consistency and as it relates to president bidens thing as it relates our business i mean lets take maybe take a large bank ma off the table weve already done one of those so we feel really good about that but as it relates to our business i mean this really plays well to our sort of core middle market business i mean if you think about the place where we offer advice and where we see activity in the future we think were actually really really well positioned john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thats helpful bill and then separately just on your systems conversion can you just give us a status update on where you stand on your core deposit conversion system just i want to confirm are you definitely moving to a new system and not a legacy system when it comes to the core deposit banking system and then where are you on that progress in that actual that part of the tech migration thanks william henry rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah daryl outlined in that one chart sort of all the different components that were doing as it relates to the core conversion we outlined in there in the fall well convert the heritage bbt clients in the first quarter well convert the core fci clients and thats on a much more agile platform than exist today so were going to have a lot more flexibility in the things that we can do and the movements we can make and the assimilation of acquisitions the ability to leverage apis and do more things with that platform and we are absolutely on track i mean as you can imagine we are monitoring this on a daily hourlytype basis were in just about in the dress rehearsal part for the fall were well into the uat and sit testing and feel good about where we are john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks
