gaap with that i will turn it over to bill william henry rogers chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks and good morning everyone thanks for joining our call today but before we discuss our first quarter results lets begin as always with purpose we see that on slide truist is a purposedriven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities and id like to share some of the ways we brought purpose to life last quarter our focus on small business heroes is a great example of purpose driving performance this strategy helps community heroes achieve their financial dreams and elevates their ability to support our neighbors and build strong communities were seeing great success with small business evidenced by the addition of nearly small business accounts during the quarter and million worth of deposits our truist community capital team committed more than million to support over units of affordable housing over new jobs and projects that will help empower almost people in underserved communities over the next three years additionally we announced the initial recipients of grants from the truist community catalyst initiative which is a threeyear community reinvestment act program aimed at four key focus areas affordable housing small business access to capital workforce development and essential community services there are community organizations receiving grants that will be used to support efforts in communities across states and allow local nonprofit organizations to better respond to critical community needs within their states lastly we published our corporate responsibility and sustainability report this month which i encourage you to read and learn more about our progress in building better lives and communities in all of these examples our core belief is evident were leaders in banking and were unwavering in care all right so lets turn to some of our key takeaways on slide first i need to state and remind everyone that our first quarter and for the previous periods have been restated to reflect the pending sale of truist insurance holdings this change has no impact on our net income available to common shareholders the restatement does remove tihs revenue and expense from our financial statements as net income from tih is now being reported as net income from discontinued operation mikes going to provide a lot more details around that later in the call on an adjusted basis we reported net income available to common shareholders of billion or a share which excludes a per share impact from the industrywide fdic special assessment and a per share impact from the acceleration of incentive compensation at tih due to the pending sale pretax restructuring charges of million negatively impacted adjusted eps by per share so despite a few discrete items in the quarter were pleased with our underlying results as you can see on the slide our solid performance was defined by several key themes first we saw a significant increase in investment banking and trading revenue driven by strong performance across much of our capital markets platform with particular strength in ma and equity capital markets loan demand continues to remain relatively muted though we did see some improvement in our commercial lending pipelines during the quarter on the consumer side we recalibrated several of the capital conserving strategies we deployed last year prior to truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 announcing the sale of tih this resulted in an increase in loan applications and in march we saw the first increase in balances since october of second our results show our expense discipline and continued focus on managing cost as a result of these efforts adjusted expenses increased by less than linkedquarter and decreased by on a yearoveryear basis although the linkedquarter rate of expense growth will increase in the second quarter relative to the first we are fully committed to delivering our expense objectives in which excluding tih should now result in adjusted expenses remaining approximately flat in versus third asset quality continues to normalize off historically low levels but were pleased that nonperforming loans remain relatively stable and the net chargeoffs were within our expectations finally during the quarter we also announced that well sell our remaining stake in truist insurance holdings which is on track to close in the second quarter sale of tih will significantly strengthen our relative capital position which will create substantial capacity for growth in our core banking businesses in addition as we discussed in february a stronger capital position affords us an opportunity to evaluate a variety of capital deployment opportunities postclosing including a potential balance sheet repositioning designed to at least replace tih earnings sale of tih also positions us to resume share repurchases the timing and size of repurchase activity will depend on our ongoing capital planning market conditions clarity around final capital rules and other factors but our goal is to resume a program thats both meaningful and durable before i hand the call over to mike to discuss our financial performance in more detail i want to provide a quick update on the progress were making in improving experiences for our clients which we see on slide we continue to show strong and steady growth in our digital capabilities in the first quarter of mobile app users grew and digital transactions increased compared to the first quarter of last year through activating teammates to educate clients on our capabilities transactions continue to shift towards self service capabilities with of deposits occurring through these channels primarily driven by strong growth in zelle transactions recently we rolled out zelle qr code widget where users where users can quickly access their qr codes from their home screens to seamlessly assist with bank transfers at truist we aim to make banking simple and easy for our clients through thoughtful enhancements to their experience enhanced offerings coupled with strong growth in digital have resulted in higher retail digital client satisfaction scores these scores surpassed premerger highs as we continue to focus on accelerated adoption and efficiency using our t3 strategy overall im proud of the continued momentum truist is making in digital and optimistic about the opportunity to expand our digital user base and drive selfservice transaction volume so with mike and with that mike let me turn it over to you to discuss our financial results in a little more detail michael b maguire chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you bill and good morning everyone as bill mentioned our financial statements for the first quarter and for previous periods have been restated due to the pending sale of truist insurance holdings this restatement has no impact on our net income or earnings per share for historical or current reporting periods however as you can see in our financial tables revenue and expense associated with tih is no longer shown on our financial statements truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 tihs contribution to truist net income and earnings per share is now captured in net income from discontinued operations my comments today will focus on revenue and expense from continuing operations although i will also provide some detail on revenue and expense for the quarter inclusive of tih for comparative purposes we reported net income available from continuing operations of billion or per share which includes a million pretax or per share aftertax expense related to the industrywide fdic special assessment we reported net income available from discontinued operations which represents earnings from tih of million or per share which includes an million pretax or per share negative impact from the acceleration of incentive compensation at tih due to the pending sale so on an adjusted basis we reported net income available to common shareholders of billion or per share which includes adjusted net income from continuing operations of and adjusted net income from discontinued operations of in addition to the items i just noted we also had pretax restructuring charges totaling million in the quarter which negatively impacted adjusted eps to common shareholders by per share the bulk of these charges were related to severance and real estate rationalization total revenue which excludes revenue associated with tih decreased by linkedquarter due to a decline in net interest income partially offset by stronger noninterest income led by investment banking and trading revenue before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased on a linkedquarter basis adjusted expenses which excludes adjusted expense associated with tih increased by adjusted expenses before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased on a linkedquarter basis next ill cover loans and leases on slide average loans decreased sequentially reflecting overall weaker client demand and our decision to deemphasize certain lending activities during which impacted growth during the first quarter average commercial loans decreased primarily due to a decrease in ci balances due mostly to lower client demand in our consumer portfolio average loans decreased primarily due to further reductions in indirect auto and mortgage during the quarter we did increase our appetite for highquality indirect auto loans which as bill mentioned resulted in consumer loan balances showing positive growth for the month of march overall we expect average loan balances to decline modestly in the second quarter albeit at a slower pace than the first quarter moving to deposit trends on slide average deposits decreased sequentially as growth in client time deposits and interest checking was more than offset by declines in noninterestbearing brokered and money market balances approximately billion of the billion linkedquarter decline in average deposits was due to lower brokered deposits adjusting for brokered deposits our average deposits declined approximately noninterestbearing deposits decreased and represented of total deposits compared to in the fourth quarter of during the quarter consumers continued to seek higher rate alternatives which drove an increase in deposit costs specifically total deposit costs increased basis points sequentially to which resulted in a increase in our cumulative total deposit beta to similarly interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points sequentially to which also resulted in a increase in our cumulative total interestbearing deposit beta of looking at net interest income and net interest margin on slide for the quarter taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by linkedquarter primarily due to higher rate paid on deposits lower day count in the truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 quarter and lower average earning assets reported net interest margin declined basis points on a linked quarter basis due primarily to higher rate paid on deposits turning to noninterest income on slide noninterest income increased million or relative to the fourth quarter the linkedquarter increase was primarily attributable to higher investment banking and trading income which was up million linkedquarter due to strong results across much of our entire capital markets platform with specific strength in ma and equity capital markets lendingrelated fees decreased million linked quarter due to lower leasingrelated gains noninterest income increased on a likequarter basis as higher investment banking and trading wealth and other income were partially offset by lower service charges on deposit and mortgage banking income next ill cover noninterest expense on slide gaap expenses of billion decreased billion linkedquarter as fourth quarter expenses were negatively impacted by a billion goodwill impairment charge a million fdic special assessment and million of restructuring charges primarily related to our cost savings initiatives excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense increased sequentially the increase in adjusted expense was driven by higher personnel expense of million due to normal seasonal factors and higher variable incentive compensation partially offsetting the increase in personnel expense were lower other expenses which declined million reflecting lower operating chargeoffs and lower pension expense adjusted noninterest expenses before the impact of discontinued operations accounting increased on a linkedquarter basis on a likequarter basis adjusted expenses declined million or reflecting lower head count and continued expense discipline moving to asset quality on slide asset quality metrics continued to normalize in the first quarter but overall remain manageable nonperforming loans remained relatively stable linkedquarter while total delinquencies were down basis points sequentially driven by a 7basispoint decline in loans to days past due included in our appendix is updated data on our office portfolio which is virtually unchanged at of total loans however we did increase our reserve on this portfolio from to during the quarter to reflect continued stress in the sector we expect stress to remain in the office sector but believe that the size of our office portfolio is manageable and well reserved approximately of our office portfolio is currently classified as nonperforming but of these loan balances are paying in accordance with the original terms of the loan during the quarter our net chargeoffs increased basis points to basis points the increase in net charge offs for the quarter reflects increases in our cre and consumer portfolios offset by lower ci and cre construction losses our alll ratio increased to up basis points sequentially and basis points on a yearoveryear basis due to ongoing credit normalization and stress in the office sector consistent with our commentary last quarter weve tightened our risk appetite in select areas though we maintain our throughthe cycle supportive approach for highquality longterm clients turning now to capital on slide truists cet1 ratio remained relatively stable on a linkedquarter basis at as organic capital generation and the impact of lower riskweighted assets were mostly offset by the impact of the cecl phasein that occurred during the quarter we still anticipate the sale of tih will generate approximately basis points of cet1 under current rules and basis points of cet1 capital under proposed basel iii endgame rules it will also increase our tangible book value per share by through a combination of a billion aftertax gain and the deconsolidation of billion of goodwill and intangibles from our balance sheet truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 the divestiture of tih has a 255basispoint positive impact under fully proposed phasein basel iii endgame rules which is basis points higher than under current rules the larger impact on our cet1 ratio under the proposed rules is due to the reduction in certain threshold deductions due to the overall higher level of capital from selling tih the sale of tih accelerates our ability to meet increasing standards for capital and liquidity in the industry and importantly creates capacity for truist to evaluate a wide variety of capital deployment alternatives including growing our core banking franchise during a time when much of the industry is conserving capital repositioning our balance sheet and resuming share repurchases as it relates to a possible repositioning recognizing securities losses under proposed basel iii rules would have no impact jon our fully phasedin cet1 ratio since current proposed rules include aoci in the calculation moreover any decision to sell market value securities has no impact on our tangible book value per share i will now review our updated guidance on slide first all of my comments today related to second quarter and full year guidance exclude any benefit from interest income that truist will earn on the billion of after tax cash proceeds that we expect to receive from the pending sale of tih our guidance also excludes any impact from a potential balance sheet repositioning that we plan to evaluate postclosing in addition revenue and expense guidance for the second quarter and full year is based on revenue and expense from continuing operations and does not include any contribution from tih in previous or in future periods looking into the second quarter of we expect revenue to decline about from gaap revenue of billion net interest income is likely to be down to in the second quarter due to continued pressure on rate paid and a smaller balance sheet we expect noninterest income to remain relatively stable on a linked quarter basis adjusted expenses of billion in the first quarter are expected to increase in  due to higher professional fees some timing of projects delayed from  higher marketing costs and annual merit increases for the full year we previously expected revenues to be down to which would have included revenue from truist insurance holdings if we had excluded revenue from truist insurance holdings from our outlook our expectation would have been closer to down to down in today we are tightening our previous revenue guidance adjusted for tih of down approximately to down to now down approximately to to reflect the latest interest rate outlook and continued pressure on deposit mix partially offset by sour improved outlook for noninterest income our outlook assumes three reductions in the fed funds rate with the first reduction coming in june previously we assumed five reductions in the fed funds rate with the first reduction occurring in may we still assume that net interest income will trough in the second quarter of and modestly improve in the second half of the year fewer than three rate reductions would add pressure to our nii outlook and result in our annual revenue coming in at the lower end of our range for revenue to be down to as a reminder our second quarter and fullyear revenue outlook excludes any benefit from interest income earned on the cash proceeds from the sale of tih or the benefit of potential balance sheet repositioning as bill mentioned we still expect the sale of tih to be completed during the second quarter we previously expected our expenses to remain flat or to increase by in which included expenses associated with truist insurance holdings if we had excluded expected expenses from truist insurance holdings from our outlook our expectation would equate to expenses remaining approximately flat in consistent with our previous expense outlook adjusted for tih we expect fullyear adjusted expenses to remain approximately flat over adjusted expenses of billion truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 in terms of asset quality we continue to expect net chargeoffs of about basis points in finally we expect our effective tax rate to approximate or on a taxable equivalent basis our estimated tax rate excludes any impact from the gain on the sale of tih or potential balance sheet repositioning that we might consider following the sale so now ill turn it back to bill for some final remarks william henry rogers chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks mike i am proud of the results our teammates delivered during the first quarter which included solid underlying earnings improved momentum and the announced sale of truist insurance holdings as mike mentioned tih will enter its partnership with its new investors with strong momentum as evidenced by its first quarter results providing risk advice to our clients is core to our purpose and we look forward to maintaining a strong partnership with that team into the future we have great confidence in our capability to grow our core banking business and help our clients achieve financial success by delivering our commercial consumer payments investment banking and wealth platform through our existing footprint and specialty areas our top priorities for are unchanged and include growing and deepening relationships with core clients maintaining our expense discipline evaluating various capital deployment options following the sale of tih and enhancing truists digital experience through t3 all while maintaining and strengthening strong risk controls and asset quality metrics our expense discipline is showing up in our results which gives us confidence that well meet our expense objectives this year im also encouraged by the improvement in our wholesale banking business which includes investment banking and trading as it was a key driver of our quarterly results in investment banking weve increased our market share across several capital market products due to significant investment in talent and industry verticals these investments have resulted in significant increase in the number of lead roles across several products including equity capital markets leveraged finance asset securitization and ma in addition our mindshare with clients in our key industry verticals has never been stronger and we continue to expand into new verticals that are primed for growth as capital markets activities recover were seeing solid yearoveryear growth in referral revenue from commercial banking as we continue to deliver valueadded advice and capabilities to our clients our commercial teammates have responded to new expectations and we continue to add great talent to our comprehensive platform finally we made new key leadership hires within our payments business during the quarter as this is an area where we see significant opportunity for growth over time in consumer im encouraged that our internal consumer satisfaction scores have returned to premerger levels in addition net new checking account production was positive in the first quarter as we added new consumer and business accounts importantly were also seeing yearoveryear improvement in account attrition rates also during the first quarter our digital channel we acquired accounts including new to truist while also seeing a increase in deposit balances over the fourth quarter of while the branch network truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 represents opportunity for further efficiency in certain markets we continue to see improvements in productivity due to teammate execution and investments in technology were encouraged by this increased productivity well look to make investments in branches and select key growth markets in overall loan demand does remain muted but im encouraged by the improvement in our commercial loan pipelines and the growth we witnessed in consumer balances late in the first quarter by selling tih well have capital capacity to play more offense in our consumer and wholesale businesses which includes seeking ways to accelerate loan growth in our core franchise in addition our significantly stronger balance sheet will be positioned to weather an even wider range of economic environments while also giving us the unique ability to evaluate a variety of capital deployment opportunities postclosing including a potential balance sheet repositioning and resuming meaningful share repurchases later in the year although we have a plan to replace tih earnings in the near term we recognize that our increased level of capital will result in nearterm dilution to our return on average tangible common equity ratio our starting point for our roatce following the sale of tih will be exactly that a starting point the strength of our markets our core banking franchise our capital deployment options we can consider after the sale will result in improved returns over time well move with pace but well not be in a rush to deploy capital to meet shortterm expectations that dont have a longterm positive impact on our company our clients our shareholders especially since basel iii capital rules have not been firmly established for the industry so in conclusion were off to a solid start in but we acknowledge as always theres more work to do as we strive to produce better results in the future we view our first quarter performance as another step forward in that direction im optimistic about our future i look forward to operating our company from this increased position of financial strength in some of the best markets in the country and finally id like to thank all of our teammates and our leaders for their incredible purposeful focus and productivity particularly over the last few months during this important time for both tih and for truist so with that brad let me hand it back over to you for qa brad milsaps headinvestor relations truist financial corp thank you bill jamie at this time will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session as you do that id like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one followup in order that we may accommodate as many of you as possible today on the call truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 question and answer section operator yeah ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions well pause momentarily to assemble the roster and our first question today comes from john mcdonald from autonomous research please go ahead with your question john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp great thank you good morning i was wondering how the rate environment changes if at all the ability and willingness to deploy through the restructuring of the securities book mike maybe you could just comment higher rates presumably achieving that neutral impact gets a little bit easier does that affect how much you might do and maybe bill could you just make some broader comments about the options youll have to deploy organically in buybacks and other things thank you michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah thanks john for the question look i mean were certainly taking a look at the market rate environment and id say just the framework that we shared back in february we remain committed to right and so we laid out a set of objectives that spanned maintaining a relative capital position at least replacing the earnings from tih we also have ambitions around advancing our liquidity and alm position so the rate environment when we talked about that in february is a touch different than what were looking at today but we think still actionable and so our plans to evaluate a repositioning after we complete the sale are still intact i mean if you look at the short end of the curve certainly we see probably a little bit of benefit relative to what we talked about from a cash reinvestment perspective and the same goes if you think about reinvestment rates on the bonds but on the other hand you do have the tradeoff of a slightly higher realized loss in that instance william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and then ill go to the others and as you said john i mean were in a different rate environments well evaluate all the other alternatives that exist with that and theres some things that have some shorter paybacks that i think should be evaluated in that alternative and then also we have some tax efficiency as it relates to this so we have some unique components of doing this in line with the tih sale and then you mentioned sort of one of the other capital deployment options obviously the first and foremost ph for us is growth in our business i mean sort of investing in our business you saw in this quarter some of the things we did on the consumer side where we leaned in a little bit quite frankly we think some of the margins are still strong in those businesses so that what were adding is a little more accretive than it would have been in the past the risk profile is strong so we have the capacity to dial some of that up on the consumer side and then on the wholesale side just our relevance is more important so we dont want to give up all the discipline we created a lot of discipline around pricing and around structure and again what were adding today is much more accretive so well continue to pursue opportunities in our markets and through our industry verticals and weve got a good momentum in that front truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 and then lastly on the share repurchase side well be back in the share repurchase business thatll be part of the portfolio as i mentioned before were going to do all this with pace so i think it would be reasonable to assume well have some type of meaningful share repurchase sort of short mediumterm and then longerterm and just a more durable consistent share repurchase plan so its a combination of all those things factored into the equation which give us as i said before a lot of optimism about being able to improve those returns shortterm importantly but most importantly over the long term john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp thats really helpful thanks and maybe as a quick followup we saw a really strong investment banking results this quarter how much of that is good environment versus payback on some of the investments youve made in that business and maybe just comment on whats packed into your outlook for the second quarter there mike thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah so i mean a lot of it obviously is from market improvement but as you noted i mean weve been investing in this business for quite some time particularly over the last several years our existing team is really sort of rising to the challenge theyre working really great with the commercial team so were seeing all the pull through from our franchise weve brought 30plus new mds into our business so these are teammates with great expertise and great access so i think its a combination of all those things and were really confident i mean were confident headed into the second quarter and the rest of the year about the momentum in this business john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp thanks operator our next question comes from betsy graseck from morgan stanley please go ahead with your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp good morning william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp betsy good morning and welcome back truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh hey thanks so much william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp great to hear your voice betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks so much bill really appreciate it so i did just want to lean in on the loan side a couple of comments in the prepared remarks that you made one was on commercial lending pipelines building and i wanted to understand is this a change and i mean we often hear about pipelines in the investment banking side not as much on the commercial lending side and i wanted to understand your thoughts around what execution on that requires is it lower rates is it customers building more inventory or just some color on that would be really helpful thank you william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah and i did note it because its a little bit different so in the fourth quarter we started seeing pipelines decrease a little bit and here in the first quarter weve seen pipelines improve particularly on the commercial side how they get to execution and how they get to finalization will depend a lot on market conditions but the good news is clients are theyre having the discussions theyre having the debate about the new warehouse or the new fleet of trucks or the things that they want to do to continue to expand their businesses but most importantly were just more relevant i mean were just more relevant in those discussions i mean the activity that weve been able to create in terms of new relationships i mean almost of the activity that we added in the quarter were new relationships so new to truist so i think a lot of ph it had pitched activities up all the things were doing new left leads are up so i think its some combination of a little bit of the markets that we operate probably a little more optimistic than the rest of the country our investments that weve made products capabilities and our overall relevance with our clients so were talking to them about things they want to listen to they want to talk about and i think were just better positioned than weve ever been betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so then the followup is on the auto side you mentioned that youre leaning into indirect high quality so i just wanted to understand what does highquality indirect autos mean to you and then the relevance to corporate clients increasing is that a function of balance sheet size or a product mix or maybe if you could just audio gap i know i squeezed in two but it was a followup plus a followup thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp betsy you get extra permission indiscernible truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp for a few more yeah exactly yeah so on the auto side maybe to compare and contrast its not rack for us its sort of our core prime auto business in terms of growth and again just being able to be a little more relevant to our dealers and creating a little more capacity youve seen lots of changes from people in and out of the auto side we like the consistency of it and again we have deep strong relationships with lots of dealers and this just adds to that portfolio and then on the corporate side same thing on the if the question was related to the risk profile similar kind of risk profile i mean we created as i said a lot of discipline over the last year in terms so we were optimizing capital and we want to continue to do that so the same expectations that we have for full relationships the same expectations we have for the risk profile so i think everything were adding is just more accretive than what we were adding before based on our capabilities betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you so much bill appreciate it operator our next question comes from scott siefers from piper sandler please go ahead with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the question lets see mike wanted to just ask a little on the guide and the nuance so if i understood it correctly on an applestoapples basis the fullyear guide is the same for expenses but tightened up to the low end of a prior range as better fees are offset by slightly weaker nii outlook so hopefully i got that right but within there just curious for expanded thoughts on what has changed within the nii expectations i imagine the preponderance of it is just fewer rate cut expectations with the three versus six previously but maybe you could speak to other factors such as deposit mix or pricing nuance that might have impacted as well michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah scott you made it easy for me those are the answers so for us we had five cuts back in january i think the market had six were looking now at three i think the market has two or fewer frankly and so i think maybe one nuance to our outlook is that we believe that sort of to manages three cuts or even fewer cuts than three so perhaps worth noting there and then beyond just the curve we have just and i think our expectation in january we were six months from the last hike and here we now sit at nine months and we probably had an expectation that thered be a touch less churn and pressure on pricing and mix on the liabilities portfolio side so those are the two factors and then of course were seeing some strength from a fee side so put that on the blender and to feels right truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp indiscernible r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp ph mike as you know that does not include tih repossession indiscernible we sort of have to say all this in the same sentence r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp indiscernible michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp right r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah totally understand thank you and then mike maybe just on sort of the competitive environment for funding on the one hand its a general question but also curious to hear your thoughts insofar as there are a lot of outofmarket competitors encroaching on pretty attractive demographic markets so just curious to hear just your thoughts on sort of rationality of ph funding and pricing are they having a visible impact or is the market pretty rational as to what you would expect in a higher for longer environment how are those things all trajecting michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah i mean look one of the benefits of operating in such attractive highgrowth markets is is theyre attractive to others as well and so its always been a competitive marketplace for us but i dont think were seeing what i would describe as irrational behavior in the market i think were at a little unusual moment in the cycle being as high as we are for as long as weve been here and so youre seeing a variety of strategies but by and large i think people are all trying to solve the same problem we are which is when will we perhaps see some relief on the rate side meanwhile were really just focused on supporting our clients right and so weve got the right products we think and the right client experiences and were going to pay a competitive rate to defend the relationships that you would expect us to defend truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah its also scott why we focus on net new so in addition to sort of the pricing within our existing portfolio we want to make sure were adding net new accounts so our rate of acquisition has been really strong and our rate of attrition has been improved so those are important barometers for us to sort of look at the overall health of the franchise and our relative competitive positioning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you all for the color operator our next question comes from ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead with your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks guys just wondering just in terms of sequencing and how well understand how the rest of the potential benefits look like following the close of the transaction i guess just wondering are you still anticipating a june close and then do you anticipate like just next earning season well kind of get the understanding of the full impacts of both cash reinvestment and whatever you may decide to do on restructuring michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah hey good morning ken its mike we dont have a date certain on closing but we have increasing confidence that  we will be able to complete the transaction i think once we complete the transaction we think therell be an opportunity for us to communicate during the quarter sort of what things look like from there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then just underneath the surface i guess its hard because by youll probably have done some of these things but you mentioned nii down a little bit in the second quarter ex the deal do you have a view of kind of where that core nii would be heading as we look into the second half of the year and kind of when that gets to stability point michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah thats right and the guide we gave for  is sort of ex any cash or ex any potential benefit from a repositioning so that down to is i think what youre asking for at least in the quarter and we do believe that the second quarter will be a trough for us so if you think about the third quarter a i think well get a touch of benefit just on the a our baseline has us getting a cut in june and if you think about the third quarter maybe a cut and a half if you get september early september also so you got a cut and a half youve got one extra day in the third quarter and maybe a touch of a larger balance sheet if we start to see a little bit of loan growth come through so we see some modest improvement in  and the same in  sort of a baseline path i think fewer cuts puts a little bit of pressure on that but i think we still expect to be a trough from an nii perspective regardless truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great yeah it was the second half point that i was looking for that incremental color on michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you on kind of how it improves okay and then just one more followup on ib you mentioned the investments youve been making at the quarter was outstandingly good are you kind of implying that flat fees in the second quarter that this is a new run rate for ib and trading some other banks have talked about pull forward in dcm but just want to kind of understand the color where you think the puts and takes are for fee income growth from here and thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i dont think theres been any particular pull forward this was a particularly strong ma quarter ma is a little less predictable on a quarteroverquarter basis but i think as we look sort of if were thinking short term like next quarter next couple of quarters i mean this seems to be a pace that were operating at right now in terms of our momentum and pipelines ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks very much guys operator our next question comes from mike mayo from wells fargo securities please go ahead with your question mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi if i can just get one simple question and one more complex question the simple question is so youre guiding for a trough in nii in second quarter and that does not include any deployment of the billion so if you just put the billion say you get a yield on that then you get million that would add to your yearover year revenue growth and also how much would the sale of insurance improve your tangible book value michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp the first question thats right mike the guidance really for the year end specifically you asked for the quarter does not include the benefit of the cash we do expect the cash proceeds after tax to be about billion you can pick your forward curve deployment rate but i think youre in the ballpark and your second question was what would be the tangible book value per share improvement for the sale i think was the question that would be by roughly a third truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then bill for you i know i brought this up before but were after five years the announcement of this merger and at least five years ago as of today your stock is down onefourth the ph bkx is flat the sp is up twothirds and im looking i guess your annual meeting is tomorrow and you talk about leaning into your purpose inspiring to build better lives and i just dont see the word shareholder there or on that by the way i love purposedriven capitalism and i love how you bring that up but i think if you dont bring shareholders along on that side you say happiness i dont think the shareholders are too happy if theyve been around for the last five years so can you just pull the lens back a day before your annual shareholders meeting and say what youre doing to help make shareholders happy assuming that your clients employees and communities are happy how do you bring the shareholders along a little bit more thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks mike so just to be clear in our mission statement our shareholders are a key component of our stakeholders so theyve never been excluded in terms of our purpose and i just fundamentally believe that purpose and performance are inextricably linked so there just no doubt about that did we lean in a lot to clients and teammates and communities during the first part of our merger and during covid absolutely are we leaning in equally now with shareholders as component of all that absolutely and you see some of the actions were taking some of the momentum that were creating i highlighted in the beginning of this call sort of small business as an example of how purpose and performance are linked so focus on our small business community heroes which is great thats very purposeful help them build their businesses and help them build their communities but also meant we added of them and we created million of deposits so i do think theyre linked i think if you sat in our company and listened you would understand that people make the connection very very clearly and im not confused about that and i think the actions that weve taken in the fall the actions that were taking now the momentum weve created are solid evidence of our focus on our shareholders as well mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator and our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead with your question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc maybe just bill following up on from a shareholder focus i think theres a lot of focus around what this company can earn on a goforward basis as we think about return on tangible equity maybe you want to wait for a few months i appreciate that till the deal closes but give us a sense when you look at sort of consensus numbers return on tangible equity im assuming thats not kind of what youre aspiring for so give us a framework when we think about your peer set whether you think you can get there and then just how quickly given maybe theres still some more tech spend to be undertaken over the next few years yeah if you could start there thank you william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah ebrahim i think ive hopefully said very clearly that thatd be a starting point so that would not be an acceptable return for us long term it is a component of a reset if you think about it there are let me put it into a couple buckets so short and medium term we have a chance to actually move that more demonstrably so think about the securities repositioning sort of as a step one and share repurchase a little more meaningful to start with and more durable over time so we have a short and mediumterm unique capacity to increase that and then long term has to come from the growth of our business and were in the best markets were creating momentum in all the segments of our market were creating a lot of efficiency so every dollar of revenue is going to be more efficient in terms of how it produces income for our shareholders over time and our ability to continue to invest so you mentioned technology but all those will be components so the expenses are related to also our capacity to save money and invest in our company long term so short and medium term we increase the slope a little bit and then long term increase the slope over time its a little too early for a sort of a specific target the target right now is to grow and again grow meaningfully as we understand the capital rules a little bit better get through some of the capital planning well be in a better position to talk about more longerterm targets ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and mike just quick one for you so it sounds like fewer rate cuts is negative but at the same time the cash will make the balance sheet asset sensitive with the cash i mean im just wondering if we have to if we were to assume there are no rate cuts this year is that really negative or more a neutral scenario given the cash will be sort of earning higher for longer in that backdrop if you could clarify that thank you michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah no well ebrahim what i was talking about was sort of a continuing ops guide so ex the incremental cash so we feel like therell be downside right so our to contemplates three cuts baseline but ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yes truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp fewer cuts as well to the low side i think if you added the cash youre right that would add asset sensitivity and that would just sort of transform our nii trajectory broadly obviously when that asset sensitivity comes onto the balance sheet well manage that consistent with how weve managed rate risk in the past which is we would probably add some receivers to manage against lower rates longer i think i answered your question which is the guide is continuing ops ex cash we think the to has that in the cash and any repositioning benefit would be on top of that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats great thank you so much operator our next question comes from matt oconnor from deutsche bank please go ahead with your question matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning what do you think is a good capital level to be running at kind of looking out medium term including aoci michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah hey matt its mike ill take a swing at that one its one thats tough to get on the record on as you know i think others are probably in the same boat i think the good news for truist is we find ourselves at least once we get our tih transaction completed in a really strong i think on a relative and absolute basis capital position with the rules still in a proposal stage i think its really hard for us to determine exactly what a target might be i think we do find ourselves in a position right now of some amount of excess capital its impossible to understand exactly what that level would be but the good news again is we do have the confidence in our current level such that we can shift from sort of a phase where weve been conserving capital to a phase where were deploying capital and optimizing that capital and putting it to work and whether thats in the core balance sheet which would be our first priority is to grow client relationships and balances and make money the oldfashion way we obviously have been clear that we think theres we have the capacity to evaluate a repositioning of the balance sheet and of course bills been pretty direct about our ambitions around buying back stock so dont have a target for you but our sort of tone and mindset and planning is oriented around growth matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just i didnt see in the disclosures but reminding what the adjusted cet1 is right now and again obviously youre picking up a lot in the deal but whats the starting point right now michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 were at as of the end of the quarter which is flat to last quarter obviously the cecl phasein impacted the linkedquarter advancement and if you fully phased in the proposed rules our aoci would i think worsen that by a little over the thresholds a little less than and then rwa inflation maybe a couple call it basis points so i think were around maybe on a fully phasedin basis today matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then obviously of that we would add the or you said so michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp thats right william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay all right thank you operator our next question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please go ahead with your question gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning bill good morning mike william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mike to follow up on the bond potential restructuring a technical question are you guys permitted i know you can restructure the afs availableforsale portfolio but can you touch the heldtomaturity portfolio as well and second if this basel iii as we know appears to be delayed because of a big change coming if basel iii doesnt get solidified and finalized until first or second quarter of next year how does that impact your guys decision making on when to possibly do this restructuring michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp sure gerard the first question no the htm portfolio wouldnt be eligible for repositioning we wouldnt be in a position to sell those securities or the consequences that we would have to mark the rest of the htm securities in terms of basel obviously weve been engaged in the advocacy there as well weve been monitoring the truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 evolution of the rule it does seem at this point that a final rule certainly is delayed versus our what we probably would have expected a year ago or even six months ago but i dont think we have an expectation that the substance of the rule thats going to be most relevant to truist is likely to change which is the inclusion of or the deduction of aoci from regulatory capital so i think we feel good about our path forward and look i mean i think we were pretty clear in february again around our objectives with a potential repositioning and just to sort of state it again i mean one whatever we do we want to make sure that we still have ample capacity to grow the business and execute on the buyback that bill has mentioned but its really important to us to at least replace the tih earnings in whatever we would contemplate gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then possibly a followup on the commercial real estate detail you gave us in the appendix it looked like the nonperforming loan percentage declined a bit from the fourth quarter chargeoffs however obviously went up your reserves also went up relative to total loans any color that you guys can provide us on whats happening to the mix of the commercial real estate obviously office is the one that were all focused on but any other areas that you guys have some color would be great thank you clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah gerard this is clarke we were very pleased in the quarter to your point we did see our total cre npls go down and that was driven by deliberate actions we took to continue to work through the stressed exposure in the cre office we actually reduced cre office million or for the quarter while addressing about million worth of maturity so as weve said before were not going to kick the can down the road so were trying to be very intentional about recognizing where we have exposure and going ahead and dealing with that and thats what created the higher losses for the quarter but the tradeoff was lower npls to your point we also feel very good about our reserves our office reserves were increased to and also for the stressed more institutional style were nearly were about so were wellreserved i would say the other cre segments are holding up really well i know theres a lot of talk about multifamily id say for us what we see there is mostly a migration to the watch list but not to npl or losses yet and were working with those borrowers and were quite pleased that most sponsors are coming in and addressing resizing if necessary interest reserves or other structural ways to keep those performing so we feel good about the overall cre book and our trajectory right now gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you appreciate it operator and our final question today comes from vivek juneja from jpmorgan please go ahead with your question vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks hi bill hi mike truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2024 william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc a couple of quick questions one is the balance sheet restructuring that youre talking about any sense of timing in terms of how long do you expect youd get done by assuming you close on june do you think youd get done by end of this year or you think it ends heads over into are there any sort of tax reasons why you have any time limitations william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp maybe let me hit that mike so i mean the spirit would be simultaneous so that would be the spirit in terms of how we would potentially restructure vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then as you restructure bill are you thinking you replace the securities with other securities i know youre only going to get it to you want to get earnings to neutral where are you at this point in thinking are you willing to go more what do you think in terms of ongoing run rate of securities as a proportion of earning assets yeah michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah hey vivek its mike ill take it in february what we laid out was sort of an even redeployment into cash and securities even that i think was hypothetical when as you can imagine we are keeping an eye on the market and thinking about the tradeoffs around different whether it be mortgages or treasuries and cash so i think well get that mix right and well be guided on not just earnings obviously we have an objective of shortening the balance sheet and improving our readiness around what we think will be more rigorous liquidity requirements over time and so thats actually one of the great benefits of this transaction or this collection of potential transactions is its not just about capital this really does move us forward more broadly so vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay all right thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen with that well be concluding todays questionandanswer session id like
