william henry rogers jr chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks ankur and good morning everybody and thank you for joining our call today we delivered solid first quarter results representing the diversity and flexibility of truist in a more volatile market and business environment net interest income declined sequentially due to lower day count lower ppp revenue and purchase accounting net interest margin slightly exceeded our expectations and more importantly both nii and nim appeared to have bottomed and have good upside from here fee income was below expectations primarily due to investment banking and mortgage both of which were negatively impacted by the market environment these effects were partially offset by higher insurance income which underscores the advantages of our diverse business mix expenses were lower than expected reflecting strong expense discipline and lower incentive compensation associated with software fee income we experienced continued solid loan growth albeit with headwinds in certain areas credit quality remains excellent contributing to another provision benefit we also completed our largest conversion event in february truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 there is a palpable level of excitement from our teammates to go to market as one truist with an expanded toolkit to better fulfill our purpose well share more details on these topics during the presentation first and foremost were guided by our purpose which is to inspire and build better lives and communities were convinced that our purposedriven culture is the foundation for our success as a company our purpose defines how we do business every day and it provides a framework for how we make decisions on slide we highlight some of the ways were bringing purpose to life a key area of focus for truist is financial inclusion were wholly committed to removing barriers and improving access for the financial system for all communities which is why im pleased that the truist foundation is supporting nonprofits that serve women and minorityowned small businesses and advancing digital equity among historically underserved communities we know people want to work for companies that stand for something meaningful and the combination of our purposedriven culture with our industryleading compensation and benefits training development and flexible approach to work is highly effective in attracting and retaining top talent we plan to further strengthen our benefits programs by launching an employee stock purchase program later this year subject to shareholder approval we also implemented our truist work model with a focus on intentional flexibility as our teammates return to on site work throughout march personally it was just incredibly energizing to have so much inperson engagement over the last two months whether with teammates clients community members or shareholders hybrid and more flexible work is here to stay but im pleased at how our teammates have embraced this new model were also doing our part ph to convert climate change and in late january announced our plans to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by were externalizing our own net zero aspirations and furthering the transition to a low carbon economy by adding new teammates in our cib and commercial community bank to help our clients make their own transition lastly we completed our largest core bank conversion event in february this was an enormous undertaking with that involved transitioning nearly million clients to the truist ecosystem and unveiling roughly truist signs across our footprint which will further build our brand the integration was successful overall especially when you consider the scale and complexity involved this was the largest bank technology integration in over years i want to personally thank our teammates for their hard work and preparation as well as the many personal sacrifices theyve made to ensure the integration was successful because of you we now have millions of truist clients who are absolutely pleased with their experience at the same time its also impossible to execute an integration of this magnitude perfectly ive acknowledged there were some opportunities to improve along the way our teams did an incredible job in resolving client challenges with urgency and a view towards longterm client and teammate experience improvements my commitment though is that we will not rest until every client is satisfied moving to slide our adjusted results exclude million of aftertax mergerrelated and restructuring charges and a million of aftertax incremental operating expenses related to the merger we also generated a million aftertax gain on redemption of a noncontrolling equity interest related to the acquisition of certain merchant service relationships which will provide truist a larger share of the economics and more control over the endtoend client experience truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 finally we incurred a million aftertax loss to reposition approximately billion of securities to enhance our yield by approximately basis points the total eps impacts of these items was per share daryl will provide more details on these items later in the presentation turning to our first quarter performance highlights on slide we earned billion and a share on a reported basis excluding the selected items on slide adjusted earnings totaled billion or per share up compared to a year ago primarily driven by lower loan loss provision compared to the fourth quarter adjusted eps declined driven primarily by a decrease in adjusted revenue attributed to more challenging market conditions and fee businesses such as investment banking and residential mortgage in addition to some normal seasonal patterns adjusted rotce was a strong unchanged from the prior two quarters even excluding the reserve release adjusted rotce was still a strong adjusted expenses decreased slightly as seasonal headwinds were offset by lower incentive compensation due to software fee income in addition to our ongoing mergerrelated cost save efforts while operating leverage was a negative basis points yearoveryear we are still targeting positive operating leverage for the full year asset quality continues to be excellent net chargeoffs remained low contributing to a provision benefit during the quarter capital deployment remained healthy in the first quarter as we completed the acquisition of kensington vanguard and certain merchant services relationships and funded solid organic loan growth ill provide more details of our loan growth shortly overall were off to a slower start in than we would like but i believe our performance can improve throughout the year in addition to the core bank conversion we completed the migration of our retail business and wealth plans to the new truist digital experience and now have sunset all heritage digital experiences as youll recall early in the merger we made the decision to build a completely new digital experience rather than relying on existing systems and thirdparties given the increasing importance of digital channels to our clients we built this new platform based directly on clients feedback and weve introduced it in ways learning from each release and continually improving with a more modern and agile platform and approach were able to introduce a number of new features to both sets of heritage clients in advance of the core bank conversion and our speed of client experience improvements will only accelerate in the coming months and quarters as our digital and technology teams shift their efforts from integration a great example of this will be truist assist which will be our new cloudbased selfservice digital assistant that well introduce in the second quarter and will be accessible to all our clients via various digital channels truist assist will help clients execute basic tasks schedule appointments and provide insights and recommendations so they can have more control and confidence in their financial wellbeing in addition were executing and investing in a number of other areas over the coming quarters to improve our clients and teammates digital experience including but not limited to digital payments digital onboarding enhanced authentication technology and expanding lightstream to include a new deposit product on a realtime cloudbased core truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 turning to loans and leases on slide average loan balances grew sequentially and rose excluding ppp loans sequential loan growth was driven primarily by ci which increased excluding ppp and mortgage warehouse lending where balances have declined rapidly due to declines in refinance volumes loans grew across all cib industry practice groups and growth was particularly strong within our asset finance group commercial community bank ci loans grew excluding ppp fairly broad based across many of our regions revolver utilization and revolver exposure both grew in the quarter cre continues to be a headwind given a very competitive market but were optimistic that were approaching stabilization excluding mortgage consumer and card balances decreased driven primarily by a decline in auto that was attributable to ongoing supply chain issues in a highly competitive environment we also experienced continued declines in our home equity and student loan portfolios these pressures were partly offset by service finance which is performing well and off to a great start this quarter we were also excited to announce a new alliance with state farm whereby their agents will be able to offer consumer lending products through lightstream well pilot this program later in the year and loan volumes will build over time this alliance reflects truists increasing size scale and relevance in addition to the superior digital capabilities and client experience that lightstream provides in summary we continue to be positive about the prospects for further loan growth in light of current economic conditions in our pipelines our increased capacity as a company to focus on clients post integration and our differentiated set of consumer businesses at the same time though we got to acknowledge the increased uncertainty presented by a range of geopolitical and economic risks which could cause loan growth to deviate from our outlook now turning to deposits on slide average deposit balances increased during the first quarter reflecting some moderation from the pace observed in the fourth quarter total deposit costs were stable at basis points as interest rate environment evolves well take a balanced approach to managing deposits being attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate pay guided by our purpose and our desire to be responsive to the needs of our clients as previously announced well discontinue a host of overdraftrelated fees at the end of this month we also remain on track to launch our new truist one checking account experience this summer which will have zero overdraft fees the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need to via a simple negative balance buffer and a depositbased credit line limit up to were mindful of the impacts that inflation and reduced stimulus may have on certain segments of our clients particularly the least advantaged and truist one is one of the many examples of where were advancing financial inclusion despite the financial impacts weve discussed previously this is a longterm win for our stakeholders as we endeavor to improve retention increase acquisition and enhance the overall client experience with that let me now turn it over to daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail daryl n bible chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you bill and good morning everyone turning to slide net interest income decreased sequentially as the impacts of two fewer days and lower purchase accounting accretion offset the benefits of solid loan growth and higher securities yields truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 reported net interest margin was flat and core net interest margin increased basis points both exceeding our guidance by basis points the improvement in core net interest margin was primarily driven by lower premium amortization in the securities portfolio moving to slide truist has intentionally maintained a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk being wellpositioned to benefit from higher rates in the near term while maintaining some level of downside protection if and when interest rates decline we continue to be asset sensitive and estimate a basis point ramp rate increase would increase nii by a basis point shock would increase nii by approximately of our reported asset sensitivity is from the short end of the curve while early deposit betas thus far are tracking below modeled expectations moving to slide adjusted revenue declined linked quarter which is below our guidance range of down to and driven almost entirely by weaker than expected fee income fees declined sequentially reflecting challenging market conditions and seasonality investment banking and trading income declined million or as more volatile market conditions impacted ma high yieldleveraged finance and equity investment banking pipelines look healthy but market conditions will determine both how much and when the pipeline is realized residential mortgage income declined million or as higher interest rates reduced refinance activity and pressured gain on sale margins on the production side servicing was not as large of an offset as expected since the benefits of slowing decay were eroded by higher hedging costs due to the flatter yield curve card and payment fees and service charges on deposits declined million collectively primarily driven by seasonality but also due to clientfriendly fee waivers we instituted in and around the time of our february conversion these items were partially offset by insurance income which increased primarily due to strong organic growth in the first month of kensington vanguard acquisition we included a table at the bottom of slide to make other income trends more clear other income excluding changes in our nonqualified plan and other gains was up million sequentially given negative valuation adjustment for visarelated derivative last quarter and up million yearoveryear primarily as a result of higher sbic income turning to slide reported expenses were billion including million of mergerrelated costs and million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger the merger costs in the quarter were primarily connected to new truist signs branch closings and impairments and data center decommissioning efforts adjusted expenses decreased sequentially exceeding our guidance of up to and reflecting our disciplined expense management the drivers of the decline include decreased personnel costs reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and changes to the nonqualified plan partially offset by seasonally higher fica and 401k expenses the decrease in personnel expense was partially offset by increased marketing costs as we continue building our brand compared to the first quarter of adjusted expenses were stable as cost saves from fte reductions and lower occupancy costs were offset by continued investments in software and marketing along with higher truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 operational losses the operational losses have steadily increased in recent quarters as banks are experiencing higher levels of fraud activity in addition to our own decisions to enhance client experience we remain highly focused on reducing our operational losses and improving our client experience at the same time overall we have incurred significant costs in conjunction with the integration events both in the merger categories as well as run rate fees and expenses were excited that our last major conversion event is behind us and we can start to reduce the financial costs associated with these integrations moving to slide asset quality remains excellent reflecting our prudent risk culture diverse portfolio and favorable economic conditions our net chargeoff ratio for the first quarter was unchanged at basis points the alll ratio decreased to resulting in a provision benefit of million for the first quarter our reserve levels reflect current credit conditions but also take into account uncertainty associated with inflation rising rates and geopolitical events truist has no direct credit exposure to russia or ukraine and minimal indirect exposure indiscernible our exposure to subprime at the origination is or less in the other consumer portfolios continuing on slide capital and liquidity levels remained strong our cet1 ratio declined approximately basis points as a result of capital deployments related to the acquisitions of kensington vanguard and certain merchant service relationships growth in riskweighted assets and the cecl phasein in order to mitigate aoci risk and volatility we transferred approximately of the securities portfolio to held to maturity during the first quarter because we are a category iii institution aoci does not impact regulatory capital it simply impacts tangible common equity we submitted our capital plans to the federal reserve in early april and look forward to sharing more details later this summer moving to slide this slide provides additional details about three transactions we completed in the first quarter to enhance our future earnings and profitability first kensington vanguard acquisition significantly expands our presence in title insurance augments our capabilities in larger and more complex commercial transactions and will also provide additional irm opportunities given our significant presence in cre we anticipate kensington vanguard will add million revenue annually and be accretive to insurance ebitda margin by year two second we terminated merchant revenue share alliance in which truist had a noncontrolling interest the transaction resulted in a million gain for marking our stake to fair value in addition we acquired significant portion of relationships from this alliance this will position us to control more of the endtoend client experience when serving those clients we also believe that the acquisition would generate approximately million of additional cash ppnr annually last we repositioned billion of securities to enhance our yield by approximately basis points resulting in a twoyear payback moving to slide as bill mentioned we successfully completed our large core bank conversion in february were now one truist not just culturally but also in terms of branding digital and technology which allows us to serve our clients more effectively and make our company simpler to operate as we shift our focus from integration to executional excellence we will maintain our focus on realizing remaining cost savings much of that will happen in the second half of as we decommission over business applications and of our data centers our decommissioning efforts are complex and significant and we are on truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 track with our final integration largely complete our technology teams will shift towards more further enhancing client and teammate experience turning to slide we have made excellent progress across the five cost save buckets and are closing in on our commitment to achieve billion in net cost saves thirdparty spend is down from baseline levels exceeding our targeted reduction of this quarter we closed over branches exceeding our commitment to close over total branches by the end of the first quarter of we now have finished the mergerrelated branch reduction efforts and will shift to more normal course branch network optimization we have also achieved our targeted reduction in nonbranch facility space strategically reducing our occupancy costs through consolidation and closures however we still have more opportunities in which we are working excluding acquisitions average ftes are down linked quarter and since the merger our voluntary separation and retirement program will conclude in the next two quarters further supporting our ongoing cost saving efforts i will now provide guidance for the full year and new guidance for the second quarter in we now expect adjusted revenue growth of to from relative to our outlook from january the mix of revenue growth is now tilted more towards net interest income given the outlook for higher shortterm interest rates partially offset by weaker fees primarily in residential mortgage and investment banking this represents to core revenue growth when you exclude significant decline in ppp and purchase accounting as you will recall we expect a midsingle digit decline in service charges in given our elimination of certain overdraftrelated fees and introduction of truist one banking nii and net interest margin bottomed in the first quarter and should increase throughout the year based on the forward curve we continue to expect pointtopoint loan growth exppp in the midsingle digits but as bill said we acknowledge higher levels of economic uncertainty we will be at the high end of our to increase of adjusted noninterest expense largely due to the impact of kensington vanguard acquisition the first quarter was the peak for our mergerrelated costs and now we are projecting less than million for the rest of this year and none in we are still targeting positive operating leverage on a gaap and adjusted basis in though this is somewhat dependent on interest rates and market conditions we still expect net chargeoff ratio to be in the to basis points given our assumptions for normalization throughout the year looking into the second quarter we expect adjusted ppnr to grow highsingle digit with possible upside from the first quarter level as a result higher net interest income and much stronger fee income given seasonality in insurance and the potential rebound of investment banking this outlook assumes the forward curve in interest rates and control deposit betas we expect core net interest margin to increase approximately to basis points due to benefits from the march hike and from a projected basis point hike in may gaap net interest margin is expected to increase only to basis points as purchase accounting accretion is slowing given lower prepayment environment as a result of higher rates now ill turn it back to bill to conclude william henry rogers jr chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 thanks daryl moving to slide the first quarter of was historic for truist as were now serving our clients as a true unified truist across all dimensions in addition the first quarter is a strategic and financial turning point for truist strategically the completion of our core bank conversion positions us to fully shift our focus to executional excellence transformation and growth our businesses that went through earlier conversions in such as wealth and mortgage are beginning to see the benefits of this shift whether in the form new advisor hiring in wealth or significantly improved client satisfaction scores in mortgage financially the first quarter should be at the bottom for net interest income and net interest margin and fee performance should improve as market conditions normalize and we capitalize on the significant integrated relationship management and revenue synergy potential we have as a company in addition the completion of the integration means merger costs will decrease dramatically through the remainder of and well realize our remaining cost saves as data centers and systems are decommissioned in the back half of the year all of which help drive positive operating leverage to conclude i remain highly optimistic about the potential and opportunity for truist all of which are clearly summarized on slide our investment thesis our opportunity and priorities are clear shift from an integration focus to execution focus deliver better client experiences capture the significant irm and revenue synergy potential we have and shift the millions of hours of development training and effort from the integration to building better lives for our clients this shift does not require any incremental risk appetite or capital it only requires execution and focus at the same time while we believe the economy is on sound footing in the near term the headwinds of geopolitical uncertainty coupled with inflationary environment and aggressive forecast for the tightening of monetary policy create a wide range of economic outlooks as we move further into this year and next truist is wellpositioned across all of these environments given our adviceoriented model for our clients balanced approach to interest rate risk management conservative credit culture diverse business mix and strong and improving earnings profile and with that ankur let me turn it back over to you ankur vyas executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp thank you bill katie at this time will you explain to our participants how they can participate in the qa session as you do that id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one followup so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning bill good morning daryl william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bill can you elaborate or daryl as well i guess on the loan growth that you guys are seeing i think bill you touched on some very competitive forces in the commercial real estate markets and what are you guys seeing in that area and then on the residential mortgage business daryl i think you referenced that the refinancing business was down what percentage originations are refinancing in the home mortgage business william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp gerard let me start on the loan growth and maybe sort of cover a variety of different topics in your question were seeing interesting loan growth and i think the places that most highly correlate to performance i think is where were performing well so think ci as an example so in ci if you exclude ppp where remember we were overindexed appropriately you exclude the mortgage warehouse component which has a lot of seasonal components to it and sort of dissected the core ci it was up about a little over so we think that actually reflects the core component of where we see loan growth and the power and the execution of our franchise that was particularly strong and literally across all of our business lines it was good across virtually all of our geographies areas like asset finance and abl sort of ph geared supply chain were particularly strong you asked about cre and id say its a couple of different stories on the small cre side we have had some run offs some of thats been intentional in the focused areas on the sort of higher end institutional borrowers we actually performed very well weve been very competitive on the residential and industrial side particularly think specialized areas like data centers and those type of things clients are buying portfolios but it is an aggressive market so i think the places where we want to be competitive we were really competitive and the areas that weve allowed a little runoff weve allowed a little runoff to happen there daryl do you want to talk specifically about i think there was a question about the refi truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah on the residential gerard about twothirds of our activity was in refinance activity that has really come down significantly as we move to the second quarter its more of a purchase market kind of plays to our strength from that perspective so i think were hopeful that that will kind of maintain and hopefully build as the year goes on but refi is definitely being impacted the other impact on the residential mortgage is just the cost of hedging is just a lot higher right now so its offsetting some of the servicing benefit that you would get out there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup bill truist has a unique franchise where youve got your regional ph precedence throughout your franchise so you have a good pulse on whats going on in those markets can you give us an update on what your customers are telling you obviously were in a very uncertain time with the tragedy going on over in ukraine what are they feeling and are they still pretty optimistic about their business outlooks william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah maybe ill do it in two ways and maybe ill do it starting with the tangible side if you look at production and pipeline specifically theyre really strong our pipelines particularly in that core commercial business which youre talking about in the first quarter are equal to where they were in the fourth quarter in terms of strength so in terms of evidence of what we see in terms of pipelines and production id say there still is a great deal of confidence virtually every client is in some inventory build capacity i mean from a supply chain perspective theyre all wishing to increase their inventory to serve an increasing demand demand does not seem to be the particular challenge so i would say thats the tangible part now the intangible part in talking to the clients so where everybody is and whats some of the anecdotal evidence i dont think were in a full riskoff mode but there is a little bit of a wait and see i mean i think thats fair maybe a little bit of a blinking yellow light not a red light nobodys stopping so i think the combination of this tangible part that we see in terms of pipeline production need for inventory build is really solid and would be reasons to be really optimistic all with just a little bit of a cautionary note as people look forward into the next several quarters gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp i think the only thing i would add to that on the consumer side its fair to say in february during the conversion our branch people were really distracted just going through the integration and the efforts i think weve come out of that strong now and were starting to see momentum in the loan origination out of the branch areas and if you truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 look at our consumer convenient businesses that we have like lightstream and sheffield and service finance theyre all starting off really strong and seeing really good volumes as we enter into the second quarter william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah so i think to bump those comments i mean theres reason to have a lot of optimism with just a slight light level of uncertainty which i think sort of is the right balance gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you appreciate all the color guys thank you operator well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hi betsy daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc one question on just the outlook here for how we should be thinking about net interest margin and part of the reason i ask is when im looking at the average balances where you show what the yields did qonq we had some declines in consumer loans so im just wondering was that like swap related or is there something more intimate going on in the portfolio im just wondering how quickly that should bounce back given the outlook for rates that youve got daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah betsy i think what youre looking at and we can maybe check offline but i think its just the run off of purchase accounting when you look at our new rates going on in the books our new volume rates are going on higher than what the existing portfolio is right now so we are averaging up in most cases across the board there so i think overall yields will rise and when we have our projections throughout the year i expect net interest margin to continue to rise throughout the year nii to continue to grow just as the interest rates start to climb betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 and then just a follow on there is how do you think about your deposit strategy how interested are you going to be in generating accelerating direct deposit growth or would you be more in the mode of allowing runoff just trying to understand the balance sheet size and how we should think through that daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp if you look at what weve attracted from covid 80plusbillion of new deposit funding the vast majority of that is noninterest bearing and when you look at it we paid lowest rates of anybody else in the industry so almost all of it is nonrate sensitive so we definitely feel that we have betas modeled in to protect what we want to protect out there there could be a little bit of ebb and flow but for the most part we will be specific to make sure that we protect our good clients throughout the organization and do that but right now weve had rates just started to lift off and our deposit betas that were seeing right now are coming in much less than what we modeled its very early into this but i think right now i think its not a huge impact on what weve had to pay there and we still have deposits growing for us so noninterest bearing ph grow from us in this past quarter as well william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and betsy what i might add to that were operating now as a new truist so were operating with a company that has about average market share so and number one two or three market share in most of our markets so thats a new experience also this has increased capacity and marketing expense so our unaided brand awareness has really gone up actually fairly significantly since the rollout and then we just have a lot more capabilities other than rate pay i mean we just have a lot more tools and capabilities to offer our clients so were operating in a kind of this is a kind of environment we build truist forward in fairness to have a company thats got that kind of prowess and capability to serve our clients in ways other than just rate pay betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it all right thanks bill thanks daryl appreciate it operator thank you well take our next question from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning i wanted to ask about the securities portfolio and the repositionings you did this quarter so can you just talk a little bit about just where do you want that portfolio size to sit and is the changes that you made the sales and the repurchases in the forward outlook for nii daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so i think the way we are managing the balance sheet and weve talked about this before is right now we are targeting billion to billion of balances at the fed since the war started in the first quarter we tilted a little bit towards the heavier side of that just for liquidity purposes and you really look at the cash flows of the whole balance sheet in total truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 so weve had deposit growth come in so thats a positive inflow you have runoff of security thats a positive inflow our first priority is to lend it out to our clients and to basically do that once weve done what we can do from a lending perspective then the residual piece would basically go into the securities portfolio now from a securities portfolio perspective were investing in the past in treasuries mbs so those are the very high grade very secure type securities ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then the repositioning that you did this quarter i assume that thats built into the outlook and i guess is that generally where youre purchasing now youve mentioned in the slide deck is that where the front book is from here daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp so yeah the mix of what youre doing if you go into treasuries ph it isnt in the forecast treasuries are in the youre in the three to fiveyear area mbs are approaching so a blend there but i would say wed be on a shorter end of that on the duration perspective but all that is incorporated with the guidance we gave you ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thanks daryl operator thank you well take our next question from john mcdonald with autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research thanks i just want to followup on kens question just more broadly how are you guys thinking about managing capital on the regulatory side youre still well above your regulatory minimums with the cet1 but a little bit below where you usually target how are you thinking about that and then on the gaap side how are you thinking about managing against further oci risks as rates keep going up potentially thanks william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hey john its bill why dont i maybe start on the capital side i mean i think weve been very consistent about thinking about where we wanted to establish capital where we wanted to operate based on three primary factors one was just where we were in the merger how much risk did we have in the merger do we need to allow additional capital for merger risk thats obviously come down substantially i mean i would consider that sort of be in a normal mode right now and weve gotten through the big components of that really really successfully the second is how much economic risk do we have and we probably have a little more economic risk in fairness than we had a year ago but i think maybe on the marginal side and then sort of where we fit from a risk profile as evidenced by some of the ccar results and i think itll be another confirmation of our lower risk profile higher ppnr model as truist truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 so those are the three things that we put into the mixing bowl as it relates to capital and well continue to reevaluate that we feel very comfortable where we are right now well reevaluate that in the mid part of this year and try to determine the appropriate place for truist to operate but i feel like weve got a lot of opportunity in the capital side based on the evaluation of those risks and then daryl ill let you answer the other part of that question daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so on the oci john what i would tell you is category iii its not in our regulatory capital numbers of our portfolio is guaranteed so its just a matter of timing were going to get the funding back its not a permanent impairment that you see there are partial offsets once a year you mark your pension plan that mark will obviously be against what the oci is which would be some benefit at but the real hedge when you really look at this is the economic hedge with deposits i mean deposits have increased in value we dont marktomarket these nonmaturity deposits but we really look at it the value of that has well exceeded the adjustment than what you saw on the securities portfolio so thats really i think the offset that you see there if we wanted to we could put more than into held to maturity i dont think were there yet where we need to do that from that perspective i think we feel good with what weve done today john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then one nitpick as a followup daryl the duration of the afs portfolio before the transfers i think it was about years do you have the new number on what that looks like now after you moved some to held to maturity daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp about years and our modeling even with rates going up higher is basically capped out so were really in the handle and thats where its going to be until rates start to fall again john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research years now okay thank you daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp welcome operator thank you well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 good morning sorry if i missed that earlier but did you say how much of the billion of cost saves youre looking to achieve by year end in the run rate daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah matt what i would say its pretty minimal i mean we had a little bit more reduction in vsrp at the beginning of the quarter most of the branch closures were backend loaded in the quarter some of the technology savings thats going to come through thats really all in the second half we have a little bit more closures in corporate real estate so i would say its much more backend loaded we maybe got a little bit but the vast majority of it would be in the second half of matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay when you say a little bit meaning a little bit more than last quarter right because you already had at least the chunk of the billion in the run rate at year end right daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp thats right yeah so we were twothirds of the way through at the end of the year we made a little bit of progress in the first quarter and we got more to do in the second half of matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i would say matt i mean we yeah matt were on really good track on the cost saves i mean were ahead in most of the categories where we want to be and now weve got a couple of remaining big chunky ones and theyre binary you close the data center and you get the cost saves i mean so we feel really good about where we are in that trajectory matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then more broadly speaking like as we think about costs beyond this year how should we think about what truist is trying to be like is this a kind of keep expense growth low is it an operating leverage story because obviously there has been lots of puts and takes with the merger we also have inflation we also have revenue benefiting from rates which is usually a very good efficiency business but what is truist from an expense perspective looking out beyond this year william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i think matt if we think about sort of overall for truist what we expect to be as a low efficiency ratio company so i think the construct of our business mix and our structure allows us to be a low efficiency industry leading low efficiency ratio company so where that ends on an absolute basis will depend on a lot of market conditions but well be at the low end of that truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 well be a company with higher growth potential and less volatility so i mean when we think about how expenses fit into that rather than sort of the absolute dollar amount in light of expenses that support a growing business and being able to do that with i think an industryleading low efficiency ratio matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and positive operating leverage ph maybe i assume that youd asked that i want to make sure i make that clear as well operator well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just first just a clarification so youve guided revenue growth for this year from to up to to and you expect million of merger savings by year end from this point forward is that correct daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp roughly i would say million to million mike because we got a little bit of savings in the first quarter mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then more generally bill you just talked about your terminal and state superior growth superior efficiency and from what you said before you have superior geographies superior business mix superior levers with the merger model so superior but then you look at the current loan growth and its average the current deposit growth its average operating leverage this year looks average so superior features but average results i know youre going from integration to kind of execution but from our standpoint it looks like youre in a corvette going miles per hour so when will this superior positioning lead to superior growth william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp okay were going to assume were on the autobot we have no speed limits in terms of opportunity and mike were at that inflection point i mean we talked about this this is i think were right at that pivot point and i can feel it i mean i can feel all the things if you categorize loan growth but if we break it down to i think the things that are highly correlated to positive trajectory i think those are areas where actually were doing well things like sort of core ci other decisions on loan growth are related to decisions weve made about positioning our company which i think will be really beneficial to us longterm and then i look at sort of the pivot points of i mean ill pick several categories if i look at integrated relationship management it wasnt at the level we needed it to be in sort of the fourth quarter first quarter weve made the pivot point and were starting to see significant increase and youll start to see that in some of our results you see truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 that a little bit in the insurance results in this quarter where we are in terms of positive asset flow in wealth wealth teams and insurance teams net positive in terms of adding people so weve reached sort of really good inflection points there investment banking clearly in terms of adding retaining and opportunities in those businesses things like the core commercial pipelines where we are in terms of more lead deals more on the left side where we are positioned in terms of production in the places we want to be so i can feel the inflection point so maybe were at whatever it was miles an hour but the foot is on the accelerator not the brake and i totally feel that in the transition that were making at this particular juncture and im very confident about our positioning for the future mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe just one followup so what percentage of your time was spent on the merger before and how much of it was spent on continued integration now william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah if i look at my personal calendar i dont think ive been in charlotte in the last five weeks or so i mean so the i look at all of our leaders time in terms of where theyre spending time and its a significant difference ive been much more in front of teammates in front of clients and community and just my own personal time i can feel it and in fairness im just one ph symbol more teammates have been in that mode for a longer period of time than i have and we feel that power shift mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp i mean just thinking about it in a simple way and daryl was talking about it in a simple way we did about million hours worth of training so just maybe put that in context of which that million hours of training we now translate into million hours of clientrelated activity ph just as like one symbol mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator thank you well take our next question from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hi john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the mediumterm efficiency goal of the low i just want to get a little bit more color from you in terms of what exactly would you say is needed to get there in terms of the rate backdrop and then also in terms of timing that you see is reasonable to get to that low range thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah john you kind of go back to where we were when we announced this transaction back in rates were a couple hundred basis points higher back then and at that point we thought well if we got those cost saves we would be able to come in at the low at that point were definitely a different company we continue to buy and add businesses and all that but we definitely have at least a forecast from the fed for it to go up a couple of hundred basis points this year and into so assuming you get the fed up to to and we will execute on our cost saves we should have really strong efficiency ratios coming in whether we get to low or not i think theres a shot that that could happen just because of the asset sensitivity that we have in the company and what were seeing in the marketplace our deposit betas how they perform so no guarantees from that perspective but rates going up definitely helps on the net interest income side significantly and its back to kind of where we were back in john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks daryl and also on the expense side your expectation for the million in incremental expenses related to the merger to roll off in what are the biggest drivers of that decline i know you mentioned consolidation of data centers like if you can you just give us a little more granularity around what are the biggest components and related to that i know you indicated you completed your core conversion regarding the core deposit system what was the upgrade there where did you move to thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yes so from a cost save perspective obviously technology is the biggest chunk of where the cost savings would come in so that would be the majority of the savings both data centers application systems ftes all in that area would basically will be big cost savings we still have more to do on a little bit on the vsrp that will help benefit you have more on corporate real estate reductions so we have other savings so i would say overall now that weve moved from the integration to now running and operating the company we will continue to look for more efficiencies as we operate the company to give us more fuel to make more investments in the company as we move forward from that perspective and ill put it back to bill william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 yeah and then on the core conversion i mean we consolidated to our heritage core platform but that doesnt really sort of explain the nextgen opportunities we have within that so you think about the use of cloudbased and api technologies to create for example a digital experience which weve talked about so this concept of a digital straddle we were able to convert add flexibility and add products and capabilities to our clients digitally long before we converted them physically in the core conversion so i think weve got a really good strong first secondgen core platform with thirdgen fourthgen kind of capabilities that sit on top of that and then as you know were also experimenting with new core platform for lightstream so i think weve got our feet in the right place where we want to be in terms of maximum flexibility with existing core and experimenting with the new core with lightstream and a product called ph finsac which we talked about before and this digital straddle agility i think will really really pay strong dividends for us going forward john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it great thanks bill william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah operator thank you well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning just wanted to touch base on credit one bill daryl if you can just talk to us about the consumer book be it sheffield lightstream anything in particular that youre watching around consumer trends theres fair amount of concern around credit quality and im not sure if you can give any breakdown in terms of fico score within that consumer book daryl william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah clarke do you mind ph taking that clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah ebrahim what i would say is that the area were most focused on from the consumer standpoint around more path to normalization or any potential stress out there with the inflationary pressures would be in our subprime auto book remember that book is less than billion so high return business so we are watching that really closely and so were seeing the credit performance more normalized there i would say for the remaining consumer segments we principally have a primebased portfolio so less than or so of our borrowers in those segments would be considered nonprime so its not just as big of an issue there but i would say our expectations are that youll continue to see as we go through the rest of the year more normalization on the consumer side first and where were watching most closely would be the lower income consumer in our subprime auto truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just as a followup to that when we look at the reserve ratio at just give us a context of day one cecl and where you expect that to bottom out given sort of the macro uncertainties bill and daryl talked about thinks a lot clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp sure and just to remind you all our day one cecl was at and  level now is at so its down bps from the first quarter and so the other point i would make to you is our reserve coverage is even at that level are very strong to ncos and npas so the way we think about cecl we continue to incorporate multiple economic scenarios in the estimate including maintaining a pretty healthy weighting on our downside case we also this quarter considered qualitatively precision and uncertainty with respect to inflationary pressures rate increases and the war in ukraine but remind you id also reflected the outstanding performance we had from a risk profile and a credit performance for the quarter so all that being said we still anticipate potentially additional reserves in but probably at a decelerated pace compared to last year and i would just say this obviously the number and the amount of the releases is really dependent upon how the economic situation unfolds ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you ankur vyas a executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp katie we have time for one more question operator thank you well take our final question from erika najarian with ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning maybe just one clarification question for me underneath your revenue guide of to is it fair for us to assume that given the outlook for fed funds for the rest of the year we should take that in the up bps ramp scenario from slide as sort of maybe the starter point for the nii growth for and maybe take of that to up then later on how were thinking about loan growth and the long end of the curve daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so a lot of moving parts there what i would say is that in spirit i think using a good gauge with a gradual over bps i think is a good approximation the deposit betas we talked about earlier we have those being phased in and thats built into these numbers so were expecting in the first bps in the next bps and then after that truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2022 right now were performing better than that but we definitely have pickup in trajectory if this forward curve does play out as whats embedded in there youll see a big increase in both core and net interest margin from where we are today probably piercing maybe by the end of the year erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it so the followup here is given what youve baked into the deposit betas in the first bps which could be very minimal the in the up bps could be the floor in terms of this year daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp i think we have good conservative estimates so there is a chance for outperformance but its still very early erika so you dont really know but i feel pretty good with these projections and feel good bill talked earlier about our deposit base and our clients and density that we have so i think were going to have really positive net interest income as this year plays out into erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks ankur vyas executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp okay thanks
