transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 kelly s king chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thank you ryan and good morning everybody thank you very much for joining our call we really appreciate that i would say overall this quarter and this year are very good given the challenging environment that we face we had a continued focus on our strong culture its activating very very well were executing well on our revenue synergies we had really effective expense focus and we made appropriate investments for the future and importantly supported our teammates in difficult environment and kept our clients and communities number one our purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities and we think in the times we live in today this is more important than ever we focus on our mission we focus on our values i would point out to you that regarding our values ultimately we focus most of our attention on the happiness of our teammates in the challenging environment that we face today helping people get through the challenges theyre living with at home and at work and all of the various difficulties that people are going through finding happiness in this environment is a very very important undertaking and we work hard to try to help that be possible for our teammates if youre following along on the slides lets go to slide i just want to point out that its nice to say that you have a culture its nice to say you have an important purpose but its more important to live it so i just want to point out a few of the things that we have done that im proud of in terms of living our purpose during the course of the year we launched our seeds of hope program where we helped our teammates with money to go out and actually do little projects little things to help people in need we launched our truist one team fund our home page program our truist cares program was very effective where we invested over million to meet the immediate and longterm needs of our communities our clients and our teammates we provided over million in special coverage for our teammates and client accommodations billion in ppp loans we funded help for more than companies and created also or protected about million jobs and we did small to mediumsized grants in our communities im very proud of our billion threeyear community benefits program i would say to you we are ahead of the time schedule in terms of making those investments we supported those who are historically underrepresented through a million sic million commitment that does include million in helping establish an organization called cornersquare community capital which is focused specifically cdfis in the minority space and were proud that we were able to invest million over three years to support hbcus and their students on slide lets talk a little bit about where we are with the merger i want to make a point of context for you with regard to how we think about our merger because this is a bit different than most mergers its very different than many many mergers ive been through in my career were not just putting two big companies together here cutting expenses and trying to improve profitability in the short term rather were building what i call a new bank were building a bank based on the best of both from both organizations then in some cases just new systems and processes like for example in our commercial lending area weve taken the very new and very bestinclass suntrust in senior loan origination program and the bbt banking system in terms of commercial loans so combined we have the best from both sides and this is classically a case where a plus equals we certainly could have picked one it would have been cheaper it would have been faster but it would not have been better and it would not have been client focused daryls going to be talking to you about merger charges and other merger expenses a little later i just want to emphasize that as he does that remember that you have the ph normal merch that we called out early on in the announcement thats normal ph signage and truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 different systems that are just going away ph theyre being drives to helping the future benefit they really are just a merger charge and then we have these other investments which i call investments because they are theyre investments in the future they are making our organization better its client focused and while they will not be in our own growing longterm run rate these are investments that we make today to be sure that we have agile very clientfocused organization as we go forward you see there a number of accomplishments for id just point out a couple of those ph very important weve made great progress in our culture we could not feel better about that we established our brand and visual identity we successfully ph merged first digital conversion we believe in terms of modern days in truist securities activated our integrated relationship management process which is pivotal to our success we did consolidate branches leveraging our blended branch program which is ph innovative remember we did divest billion in deposits with our branches and there have been a lot of corporate backroom functions that have been integrated including audit risk legal finance and others and we importantly did a huge amount of work on appropriate job regrading for our teammates daryl will comment with regard to ph some calls with regard to that but this is a very important process in terms of making sure that our teammates through the year knew that we were going to do the right thing in terms of looking into the new responsibilities establishing the right kind of job and appropriate compensation and we chose to make that retroactive for them during because it was the right thing to do they were doing the job we just had not had a chance yet to properly raise the compensation and that served us very very well in terms of just a few points here everybody tends to focus on the core branch conversion which as you know is in the first half of that is very very important make no mistake but look theres huge amount of conversions and other activities going on in is a really big conversion year we will complete our wealth brokerage conversion well have our mortgage conversion salesforce conversion well be closing an additional branches in the first quarter well be implementing our digital first migration supporting our t3 concept in terms of meeting our clients needs on a seamless basis integrating technology and touch to yield a high level of trust and so there are a lot of activities that are going on during the course of the year so i just didnt want you to be thinking theres not much will be happening at truist with regard to conversion for the first half of because frankly most of the hard work will be done by the end of this year and then well actually execute on the final branch closures and conversions as we head into looking at few highlights with regard to our performance on slide im very excited about our revenue total taxableequivalent revenue of billion up annualized versus the fourth quarter that was really driven by stable net interest income strong fee income especially in investment banking and trading income strong insurance performance chris will talk about that as we get to questions in qa i am very proud of five insurance acquisitions just in the fourth quarter alone and we expect more activity as we head into a very strong adjusted net income available to common shareholders of billion we had diluted earnings per share of a diluted return on average assets of and a very strong adjusted return on average tangible common equity of so you can say were well underway to top performance and all the metrics that we projected when the deal was announced which is kind of miraculous its been two years there has a lot been going on but were still tracking and doing really well in terms of hitting that top performance level of metrics as we expected that we would daryl is going to be commenting on some capital issues i would point out to you that we the board did approve up to billion in common stock repurchases which will start in the first quarter we have outstanding credit truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 quality performance much better than expected and our common equity tier is exactly right on which is what we have projected a couple of years ago on slide ill just point out to you the unusual items for this quarter and you can see there we have the regular merger charges and as i related to earlier the incremental operating expenses that are not in the longterm run rate and they equated to drag with regard to gaap versus adjusted so thats a quick look at the highlights let me now turn it to bill for some focus on some key areas bill william henry rogers president chief operating officer director truist financial corp great thank you kelly and good morning everybody as kelly just noted truist is the first large bank merger in the digital age and with that in mind we determined it was really imperative that our clients begin experience an enhanced digital platform this year and this is demonstrated on page while our foundation is two leading digital experiences were going to accelerate the delivery of features like personalized financial insights aidriven chat box other clientcentric enhancements were going to pilot this in both platforms in the second quarter and then well begin migration in waves in the third quarter and complete full migration to a premier truist experience for our digital clients by yearend so emphasizing kellys point of how much is being done this year as you can see on page were experiencing excellent digital adoption and usage from our clients so for the months through november we experienced a increase in digital sales growth in active mobile users increase in mobile check deposits and a increase in statement suppression i think all would speak to increased digital adoption this is an area where were already seeing the benefits from our investment and on the right side we show some recent enhancements so for instance the suntrust business online and mobile experience incorporates significant updates and it was built inhouse to give us more control over the apps functionality and performance long term the heritage awardwinning bbt u platform now provides insights to help clients better manage new spending behaviors including an endofmonth cash flow analysis and enhanced notifications just to name a few and very consistent with our whole t3 premise this is a prime example of what kelly talked about with best of both using bbt u clientdriven frontend and a more flexible agile heritage suntrustdriven back end this clearly positions us i think really well for the future we believe initiatives such as these underscore our commitment to improve the lives of our clients and demonstrate our investment effectiveness so lets turn to page we experienced further decline in balances across most loan categories in the face of continued economic uncertainty and elevated liquidity average total loans decreased billion largely attributable to commercial loan balances and ongoing runoff in the residential mortgage portfolio in commercial average balances declined billion primarily due to line paydowns and lower utilization paydown activity reflected larger clients ability to obtain financing from capital markets and suntrust securities was well positioned to assist them which youll see later commercial balances were also impacted by a billion reduction in ppp loans and the transfer of billion in assets to held for sale following our decision to exit a small ticket loan and lease portfolio we experienced a rebound within our dealer floor plan clients after bottoming in july due to oem supply chain disruptions dealer floor plan balances have steadily improved as new car inventories were replenished we also saw a growth in mortgage warehouse lending and government finance commercial activity remains bifurcated as a whole with a greater share coming from large and mediumsized companies than from smaller businesses in truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 consumer average balances decreased billion this was largely due to seasonality and refinance activity that resulted in lower residential mortgage residential home equity and direct loan balances average balances in our indirect auto portfolio increased billion loan production was really strong as vehicle sales rebounded especially for us in the prime segment overall we remain cautiously optimistic were hopeful that the successful rollout of covid19 vaccines together with additional government stimulus will increase visibility revive confidence and support the economic recovery all of which will be essential for loan growth were extremely well positioned in businesses and markets that we believe will most benefit from this so lets continue on page and look at deposits deposit trends remain favorable during the quarter growth was robust and broadbased supported by a combination of seasonal inflows and ongoing growth resulting from pandemicrelated client behavior average noninterestbearing and interest checking balances were each up over billion while money market and savings grew billion average time deposits decreased billion primarily due to maturity of wholesale negotiable cds and higher cost personnel and business accounts importantly we were able to able a strong level of deposit growth while maximizing the value proposition to clients outside of rate pay for instance the average term deposit cost decreased basis points to basis points and average interestbearing deposit cost declined basis points to basis points so with that let me turn it over to daryl to discuss our financial performance for the quarter daryl n bible chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you bill and good morning everybody turning to slide in the fourth quarter reported net interest margin decreased basis points to reflecting lower purchase accounting accretion core net interest margin was unchanged at core margin benefited from higher yields on ppp payoffs recognition of deferred interest on loans and lower funding costs offset by excess liquidity earning assets rose billion primarily due to an increase in deposits resulting in a modest improvement in net interest income we partially hedged our exposure to rising rates by ph owning payfixed swaps to offset market risk associated with our investment securities the chart on the bottom left shows an increase in our asset sensitivity due to core deposit growth additional payfixed swaps and the residential mortgage runoff which is partially offset by the growth in the investment portfolio turning to slide our integrated relationship management strategy is helping improve fee income noninterest income increased million if you exclude third quarter security gains of million we have record investment banking and trading income of million due to strong activity in ma and loan syndications lower counterparty reserves and improved trading profits we also generated record commercial real estate income of million driven by structured real estate transactions and strong production and sales activity at grandbridge insurance income grew versus fourth quarter due to strong production and premium growth as well as acquisitions organic growth was if you exclude the truist policy placed last year organic growth was we completed five insurance acquisitions during the fourth quarter which we expect will add more than million in annual revenue and approximately million in adjusted expense turning to slide noninterest expense increased million reflecting a million increase in merger costs adjusted noninterest expense rose million due to higher professional fees for strategic technology projects and higher personnel expense personnel expense increased million reflecting higher incentives related to strong revenue production and the impact of our job regrading process which concluded late last year job regrading resulted in the fourth quarter catchup in personnel expense approximately million of this was truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 related to prior quarters through this effort we were able to honor our commitment to establish jobs and rewards programs that harmonizes all teammates in the combined framework ftes decreased during the quarter and were down since the merger was announced we closed branches during the quarter bringing the fullyear total to net occupancy decreased e26 million benefiting from aggressive closures of nonbranch facilities turning to slide as we said we are seizing the opportunity to build best of both franchise this approach is harder than a typical acquisition but we believe the benefits to our clients justify the effort since the merger was announced we have incurred billion of mergerrelated and restructuring expenses these expenses have no future benefit and are not part of the postconversion run rate we also incurred million of incremental operating expenses related to the merger these expenses do provide future benefits and are integral to building the best of both franchise the incremental operating expenses are not part of future run rate and will end after the conversions in based on our integration plan we expect the mergerrelated and restructuring charges of approximately and a total incremental operating expenses of approximately billion this results in a combined total charges of approximately billion turning to slide strong credit performance was characterized by minimal increase in npas and an excellent loss experience resulting in lower provision expense we saw favorable trends in problem loan formation as the criticized and classified loans decreased the provision of million benefited from lower chargeoffs and a modest reduction in reserves due to decision to exit the small ticket loan and lease portfolio the allowance coverage ratio remained strong at times net chargeoffs and times nonperforming loans active accommodations were down significantly since the second quarter approximately of the commercial clients and of the consumer clients who exited a combination program are current on their loans our exposure to covidsensitive industry decreased to billion or approximately of outstanding loans we also had the third lowest loss rate among peers in the latest ccar test we believe this outcome reflects prudent client selection and underwriting as well as diversification from the merger turning to slide the allowance for credit losses decreased million largely due to moving the billion portfolio into held for sale our macro assumptions include unemployment remaining fairly stable through mid and improving thereafter and gdp recovering precovid levels by late we also layer in qualitative adjustments for covidrelated uncertainty continued improvement in the economic activity less uncertainty and stabilization of a criticized asset may prompt us to release reserves in the coming quarters turning to slide our capital ratios were relatively stable but the cet1 ratio unchanged at we declared a common dividend of per share and a dividend and total payout ratios of in december the board authorized the repurchase of up to billion of the companys common stock starting in the first quarter our intention is ph to remain in approximate cet1 ratio after taking into account strategic actions stock repurchases and changes in riskweighted assets for the first quarter we expect to repurchase approximately million the board authorized other measures to optimize our capital position including the redemption of the outstanding series f and g preferred stock and liquidity remained strong and we are prepared to meet the funding needs of our clients turning to slide this slide highlights our progress towards achieving the billion in net cost saves our efforts to reduce thirdparty spend are ahead of expectations we are now targeting reduction in sourceable spend of billion in retail banking we closed branches in on a cumulative basis we expect to close branches by the first of including more than branches by the end of we also expect to reduce our nonbranch footprint by approximately million square feet through the combination of closures and downsizing through december we reduced our nonbranch footprint by approximately million square feet truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 so we are roughly halfway through our goal the remaining facilities will be rationalized during cost saves from technology are highly dependent on core bank conversions because we cant decommission systems or data centers until the conversions are complete the bottom of the slide lists where we are making significant investments we believe these investments are critical to delivering on our purpose and providing a touch plus technology equals trust approach to clients turning to slide the waterfall on the left shows how we did relative to our cost savings target our objective for was to achieve annualized fourth quarter net cost saves of million or of the billion target this equates to the fourth quarter adjusted noninterest expense of billion or less we adjusted noninterest expense of billion exceeded our target included catchup in expenses related to job grading commissions on higher revenue and the nonqualified expenses which are substantially offset in other income if you exclude these items adjusted noninterest expense would come in slightly below target as you can see from this slide we are maintaining our mediumterm targets and reaffirming our cost saving targets for and for our targeted fourth quarter adjusted expense would be billion excluding acquisitions now i will provide guidance for the first quarter expressed and changes from the prior quarter while the environment remains fluid we continue to see momentum in our businesses which may enable us to outperform the guidance the first quarter has fewer number of days and seasonally higher personnel costs we expect taxableequivalent revenue to be down to as a result of fewer days and purchase accounting runoff we expect our reported net interest margin to be down to basis points based on less purchase accounting accretion and a change in the core margin we expect core margin to be relatively stable with the exception of increased liquidity coming from the balance sheet this could pressure the margin up to basis points noninterest expense adjusted for merger costs and amortization is expected to be down to we also anticipate net chargeoffs in the range of to basis points overall we had a strong quarter with exceptional revenue growth good margin performance and expense management and strong asset quality now let me turn it back to kelly for closing remarks and qa ryan richards director of investor relations truist financial corp kelly youre on mute kelly s king chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp let me just close with a few comments with regard to the truist value proposition which is to optimize our long term total shareholder return really through a focus on strong capital strong liquidity and diversification and intense client focus we believe we can do that because we have an exceptional franchise with diverse products services and markets we are the sixth largest commercial bank in the united states we have strong market share and the most vibrant fastest growing msas throughout the southeast and the midatlantic area we are uniquely positioned to deliver bestinclass efficiency and returns while we continue to invest in the future we are very committed as daryl said to reaching our billion of net cost savings we have a really great mix of complementary businesses that allows us to expand our client base through our yieldenhancing revenue synergies we have a very strong capital and liquidity position as daryl described which positions us to be resilient as we go through the very challenging times that we are experiencing we are as i said earlier building a bestinclass new bank who is designed to be clientfocused purposedriven and resolutely committed to inspiring truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 and building better lives and communities we believe our best days are ahead for truist and these great united states of america ill turn it back over to ryan ryan richards director of investor relations truist financial corp thank you kelly abby at this time will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session question and answer section operator yes thank you operator instructions we will take our first question from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning regarding the billion in incremental operating expenses can you just talk about that like how that number has evolved versus your original expectation i know its the first time youre giving us that target so how does that compare to where you originally expected and how has it evolved over time and then can you give us a little bit more of your thought process behind it in terms of if we could continue to see upward pressure on that amount or are you pretty confident in the billion in that its going to remain at that target thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah john thanks for that question i would tell you when we were putting the transaction together in late and announcement early that we thought billion was the merger and restructuring charges and were pretty much on target with that as we continue to work on all the integrations and we saw the opportunity to really build the bestinbreed of what we could do ph with our systems and technologies we just knew that we would basically be having i would call it a lot of technology projects on steroids all at once and that this would be a really unusual time to have all that costs running through our expense structure so thats really what we came up with and weve been tracking it todate so far and we feel pretty good about the forecast that we have were almost at billion in total when you combine both charges to both the merger and restructuring and the incremental so we have about billion to go over the next years but we believe it was for the right reasons and makes all the sense and its going to help our clients and really produce a good performance for our company going forward truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so john a way to think about that conceptually is that billion is really as i think about it like a capital allocation for future benefits in terms of client focus and better systems and processes so it will flow through expenses well continue to report it to you out so you can think about it more in terms of an investment john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thank you thats helpful and then separately on the branch and nonbranch real estate reduction i just want to confirm that those reductions that youre targeting and the savings that come from that that is included in your targeted cost savings tied to the merger daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp absolutely yeah so john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay and daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp and when we came up with the five buckets we were talking about two of the buckets i mean the retail branches we said originally would be between and branches you can see were at the high end of that original estimate that will be done by the first quarter of and then on corporate real estate even before covid when you put these two companies together we have huge duplication all throughout the midatlantic and southeast so just going through and rationalizing that space i will tell you covid has helped us in a number of ways in that its emptied out the buildings so we can move quicker in the consolidation and my guess is as we continue to make these combinations that we may actually exceed what we originally estimated in corporate real estate consolidations because of covid and just behaviors of people working at home john pancari q analyst evercore isi right that was exactly what i was getting at because im assuming some of the corporate real estate reduction opportunity got bigger you saw greater opportunity as covid set in so i was just wondering if that could present upside to your costsaving expectations if corporate real estate reductions can be more than you thought daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yes so we have a plan for what were executing now on the billion once we complete that plan im sure kelly and bill and executive leadership will reevaluate it and see if there is opportunity to do more in the future operator and well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp betsy we cant hear you betsy are you on mute betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hello oh hi daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp operator betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc its betsy can you hear me now can you hear me daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yes kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi all right sorry about that yes so i had a couple of questions one just on the integrated relationship management strategy im wondering how thats progressing the revenues are strong this quarter particularly in fees and so just wanted to understand how much was the irm helping to drive that result this quarter kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp well betsy thats a huge part of it and ill let bill give you some deep color with regard to that but this is a concept of really integrating the way we focus on the client many institutions focus on the siloed way in terms of products and different services we dont do that we focus on the whole needs of the client and so weve developed this as irm process we call it integrated relationship management over really several decades and its very very effective very efficient because everybody owns a client everybody focus on meeting all the needs of their client all the time but we see a spectacular early positive feedback in terms of how its working and especially between the community bank and cig bill you may want to comment on that william henry rogers a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp hey betsy i mean this is one of the really strong cultural alignments that kelly and i talked about when we first started talking about this merger is this commitment to put the client first and create a culture and a structure that evolves from that and were seeing it i mean and the models working as kelly noted a couple of examples in truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 the investment banking outperformance this quarter in particular i mean there was really just great contribution from our commercial community banking from our cre and from our private wealth businesses so that model of integrated relationship management is working its just been great adoption great participation really good cultural alignment you see it in the insurance numbers you see it in the wealth numbers so its all part of this structure and focus and we have lots of discipline around it but the key is the cultural side ph there are people committed to wanting to work together and work together towards a common goal to meet client needs and id say this quarter was probably one of the better examples of how the engines are really firing on all cylinders betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thanks no appreciate that ph because the fees really jumped out on the screen i guess the followup question on the expense line here is around some of the core expense inflation outside of the cost saves youve got merit increases bolton acquisitions investments for revenue growth et cetera im just wondering how investors should think about where the total expense dollars will likely land post the net cost saves what kind of guidance can you help us with there thanks kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so betsy let me just mention in general we have the itemized areas youve listed but we are really focusing on expenses in a broader conceptual approach and were doing the obvious i mean the obvious are you got two of these you only need one and those kinds of things are just kind of happening but were heading into a period now where its time for us to focus on optimization its time for us to focus on transformation and reconceptualizing the business because so far what weve basically done if you think about it is put two big banks together now what we have and we get the big weve got lots of savings from that just natural overlap but now we have the opportunity to reconceptualize the business as we transform it postcovid ph and all thats going on with regard to the new digital world and there are enormous opportunities for us as we go through so is going to be an intense year of focus on expenses from the perspective of transforming our structures so that we are doing the right things in terms of investments and expense allocations to meet the clients needs first and we believe that will throw off our positive benefits in terms of expenses daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp betsy what i was saying in my prepared remarks i gave for the fourth quarter of this year the billion now that excludes the merger and restructuring charges the incremental moe expenses amortization and then i gave a call out on the expenses for the insurance acquisitions of about million adjusted expenses so all that will get carved out of that base but when you look at like the job regrading were considering that part of the investment thats something that we are covering with our net saves operator and we will take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 a hey matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc can you talk about the timing of liquidity deployment this past quarter obviously securities went up a lot it sounds like you had some of that but what made you decide kind of now is the right time weve seen the year move up but actually mortgage rates and i think rates on the types of securities that you would have bought were probably stable or down and most people i think are expecting higher rates later this year so what kind of drove you to deploy what seems like most of your excess liquidity this past quarter daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp so matt ideally we would like to take this excess liquidity that we have and deploy it in loans what were seeing is that we just have a fair amount of payoffs in the ppp but as the businesses really come back and have a lot of momentum and start growing as we get into the middle and later half of we really want to deploy that excess liquidity in lending i would say that we decided to put some of that liquidity into the investment portfolio we did that throughout the third quarter we did partial hedges on them basically to help with the marktomarket on that so when we added about billion billion to the investment portfolio we did have hedges on there of about billion that we put on to help with the market risk that we have so netnet we feel good with what weve done the real uncertainty on a goforward basis with all these new stimulus packages is we could get potentially in another billion or billion more liquidity into the balance sheet i think we need to evaluate what we do with that excess liquidity whether we keep it at the fed or invest it or ideally lend it out which is the main primary objective matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then just circling back on the incremental costs related to the deal obviously youve been incurring these already indiscernible i think for the first time which is getting a lot of attention but how will we see these on the other side right so like you didnt increase the net cost saves you havent really sized revenue synergies even though it certainly seems like there will be some how will we see the payback of that incremental billion if you can break that out somehow kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so matt these as i was describing are really investments so think about these as we are building a whole new commercial loan delivery system a whole new mortgage loan delivery system you will see the benefit of that in terms of in some cases just more efficient systems because theyre newer and the other is the effectiveness in terms of meeting clients needs so we can for example in mortgage you can just do more mortgages because youre more efficient you get more mortgage applications because you have a better client experience so its just like if your car ph is on the rundown and runout with miles you buy a new car you make an investment you see the benefit of that in terms of driving experiences less breakdowns etcetera etcetera so it is an investment that is the best way i can describe it to you to think about truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 operator we will take our next question from erika najarian with bank of america and erika your line is open please check your mute button erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi thank you my first question is on revenues kelly you were very upbeat on the future of this company and your peers were actually quite upbeat on the future of economic growth and im wondering as we think about going past the first quarter how should we think about your base case for economic recovery relative to loan growth which was where your peers were surprisingly upbeat and also specific to you the insurance outlook kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah erika we are upbeat as well ive said and ill take a second why i am upbeat with regard to the economy this economic downturn is dramatically different than what weve all experienced in the past if you take the indiscernible it was about a commercial real estate bubble was a technology bubble was a residential real estate bubble there was no bubble here there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the economy in fact we had years of robust growth you have ever low inflation we just shut it off thats important because there were not underlying impending issues that caused the economy to sputter now if you kept it shut off for years youd have another issue but given where we are with the vaccines etcetera we fully expect that youre most likely to see a stronger snapback in the economy than most people expect when we talk to our clients and prospects they are really pretty upbeat they are saying things like its time to get on with it were ready to go were making investments and were seeing that in terms of our robust pipeline of loan request activity and so we are upbeat with regard to the economy we think itll be slower in the first part picking up steam as you get through the midpart stimulus will help that some but mostly businesses and consumers feeling more confident look when the vaccines are out there which they are and as they become more widespread in terms of being injected fear goes down confidence goes up people are ready to live again people are ready to invest theyre ready to run their businesses so i fully expect by the time we hit towards the fall and end of the year youre going to be really surprised in terms of how robust this economy is that will show up in terms of commercial loan activity in a very big way youll likely to see more residential loan growth than we would have expected in a slower economy and certainly you will see it in terms of insurance activity as well and let me just turn quickly to chris henson and let him give you some color with regard to insurance because its very important christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist bank yeah thanks kelly and erika thank you for the question so id maybe just hit sort of fourth quarter and maybe just the outlook to your point one of the best quarters that we have had in some time and all the drivers of organic growth are really kind of hitting on all cylinders client retention has stabilized then in retail at north of for the last months wholesale really strong at were really seeing ph because of the factors in the market standard carriers are pushing risk to the wholesale market and were benefiting from that pricing another element of organic growth as strong as were in the hardest market weve seen in two decades rates are up in the industry north of and its anticipated that well continue to see some ph hardening in acceleration into our new business new business in was up in the to truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 that was as good as weve seen then we get covid and we were kind of negative to didnt know where the year was going to shake out but this quarter our new business was up up yeartodate some of the best numbers i have ever seen so that all led to an organic growth number that we reported to like quarter yeartodate but just to key in on one point daryl made i think its really important the growth number was really negatively impacted by a onetime moerelated piece of insurance that was booked for our moe deal in  so if you exclude that noise organic growth really would have been on a core basis in terms of outlook we expect first quarter commissions to be up in the range were moving from our third best quarter of the year to our second best and first obviously uncertainties in covid impacted the economy but the outlooks really strong given the accelerated pricing exposure units in the business are holding would grow in excess of surplus lines because of the shift that i mentioned ph and the standard carriers that support retail pushing it to es and were really benefiting from that diversification and the pricing momentum if you think about the markets digesting the covid impacts cat losses we had storms this year the most in history in any given year and three of the you know largest years in history of cat losses have occurred in the last four years so its got upward pressure and then lower interest rates which puts pressure on investment income for underwriters so pricing up youre seeing examples of things like umbrella and excess up do up property which we had a lot of up up in all classes all accounts so looking forward what were expecting is in first quarter is somewhere around the kind of organic growth rate number and we think that elevated catastrophe level low interest rates all thats really going to keep it propped up and kelly mentioned acquisitions we were able to close five in the fourth quarter and we expect more in so really bullish about insurance going forward erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you that was very helpful my second question is a twoparter on expenses daryl if you could maybe briefly describe whats in the billion number that would assure your investors that if it doesnt linger in the run rate i think everybody gets scared when you see personnel as a descriptor and going back to slide as a followup question to that and a followup question to betsys question what do we do with that ph that annualizes to ph as we think about your run rate is that a base for the run rate that includes the savings plus the growth rate just help us think about how to think about that number for daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp so ill start on the latter question first so its pretty simple we basically gave you guidance for fourth quarter of which was the billion in there that excludes the restructuring moe amortization and acquisitions thats it so thats the number we are targeting to get for fourth quarter of thats pretty simple and then that will continue on in when we get all the cost savings of the net billion your other question on what was the question again on the first part erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 yeah if you could describe the types of expenses youre incurring in that billion merger daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah the incremental erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc yeah yeah daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah its technology projects and so the expenses that we can carve out are onetime costs like when we decommission something or something thats put out of use from that perspective has no future benefit thats in the original merger and restructuring charges but when you have developers going in and you have people going in with systems and you have architects building out our new indiscernible and theyre basically building a whole new truist environment and technology all those are real costs were doing all these technology costs all at once all that has future benefit we would typically not carve that out as a merger and restructuring because its basically just the culmination of doing a lot of technology projects all at once we just thought it was fair to call out because you would never really think of doing this all at once if it wasnt for the merger but as kelly said at the end of the day were going to have a much better client experience were going to have a much better performance overall and you should see the benefits of all of these systems integrated by doing the best between each of the systems that i think youll have a lot of revenue and other synergies going forward kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp erika keep in mind what daryl emphasized when youre doing these projects you bring all those consultants in but you also get them out so with regard to consultants we have a narrow front door and a very big back door and im guarding the back door erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you operator we will take our next question from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning i had a question on back book repricing dynamics and how to think about that from here for legacy bbt and other banks more broadly we saw a downward pressure on loan yields persist throughout the last zirp cycle despite having a steeper curve can you discuss whether that downward pressure on yields is a dynamic youd expect to persist throughout the remainder of this zirp cycle as well truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp bill i would say in a normal balance sheet structure that would make a fair amount of sense what we have going on on our balance sheet remember we have some purchase accounting we have ppp and all that we actually saw our yield you can see that on our tables you can see that we actually had loan yields higher for those various reasons that said i would tell you the steepening of the curve we are asset sensitive were asset sensitive across the curve a little bit more short end than longer end but as the yield curve shifts we will benefit from that 25basispoint steepening of the curve will basically give us to basis points in core margin so that is a phenomenon if you look at how things are going on and off on a pure basis actually looked at credit spreads going on our commercial credit spreads are going on maybe at or basis points higher than what theyre coming off at so i think all that is relatively good from that perspective william henry rogers a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp yeah and let me just take the to daryls point thats also a business mix and focus issue so what would sort of be traditionally a different back book look on a forward basis as daryl noted i mean were seeing improvement in margin that has to do with focus type of relationships value that were adding all those type things and as he noted you see that particularly in the commercial side bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats really helpful and just a quick followup on that same question to the extent that ppp and then are going to be sort of contributing to the nim in this zirp cycle can you discuss how long you would expect those tailwinds to persist through and then not or would they carry to as well kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp indiscernible daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah chris you want to start this one then ill finish off kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp okay christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist bank sure yeah we do obviously plan to participate in round two probably in the neighborhood of billion or so we see most of round one playing out through and round two probably coming in the first half of the year and then rolling out the back half of the year really hard to call exactly when what quarter exactly that all is going to flow out but to answer your question i would say 90plus percent of it should be gone by the end of truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah the thing i would just add to that bill is that it has a huge impact obviously on core margin depending on when the forgiveness happens and it could be anywhere from to basis points depending on the amount that actually happens in a given quarter one thing to note round two is really focused on more smaller loans so these actually drive higher fees like our average fee on round one was about our estimate this is just an estimate because its just now starting to roll out we might be north of fees on round two and well have less volume but it will also have a huge impact when those actually are forgiven as well christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist bank and just to give you a sense we have invited of round one to apply for forgiveness but they submit information at different times weve received and proposed on to sba about of that to this point so some of the timing is really determined by the timing of the client providing the information operator and we will take our next question from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning guys i wonder if daryl you could provide us a little more color on that commentary you gave about the first quarter revenue outlook i believe you said down to fte can you help us understand just what chris gave some color on insurance but kind of the bifurcation between what you expect out of nii and fees and what the drivers would be especially in those other fee areas in addition to insurance thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah ill be happy to do that so when you look at margin because we have the difference between our reported margin and core margin we are going to have less over time accretable yield going into our margin now thats volatile i would say that that could be down anywhere from to basis points of less accretable yield that impacts reported margin on a quarterly basis so that trends down its just how much is down is kind of goes back and forth from that from a core margin perspective our core margin is actually holding up really well weve done really well this last couple of quarters with that the uncertainty we have is that how much more liquidity are we going to get into the balance sheet and liquidity into the balance sheet pressures core margin if we decide to invest the liquidity in securities it gives us a little bit more nii if you leave it at the fed you basically just tread water on nii so we have to make those decisions as we go forward but depending on how much liquidity we get in with the stimulus packages core margin could be a little bit volatile i think you have to move to shift to net interest income and focus on net interest income and what the impacts are until that noise gets out of there on the fees side i will just tell you the business has had a lot of momentum insurance always is very strong in the first quarter its usually their strongest quarter but if you look at ph those area in investment banking and trading the huge pipelines they had kind of filled in the fourth quarter if kellys right with the economy he could have a great quarter in joes world in wealth they have a lot of momentum theyre adding new accounts in our retail area they have traction our community bank commercial actually is growing truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 commercial loans when you look at the detail i dont know if bill or chris want to comment on the momentums we got on revenue on those businesses william henry rogers a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp i think you said it daryl i mean if we look at things like pipelines going forward and production in the fourth quarter we have a reason to be optimistic thats against the headwind though of ppp pay downs and utilization being at sort of actually uniquely low levels so i think the things that we can control production pipelines are doing well and then i think well see the benefit of that over time whether that manifests itself in the first quarter second third or fourth will be dependent upon all the things kelly talked earlier the confidence and market acceptance of where we are christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist bank yeah i might just add opportunities were seeing really for growth auto is very strong right now we were up about billion in average balances we see that continuing into the first part of the year mortgage warehouse lending because of the environment also very very strong ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it great and just one more followup on that billion number daryl so thats a seems like to be a real landing point that youre targeting before the million quarterly version of the million of insurance adds just to get to the base would that billion also be inclusive of incentive comp or core underlying cost inflation thats an absolute goal that youre trying to get around that number before we add the acquisitions and other stuff daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp our hope to be honest with you is that our fee income is so strong and all that ph then im going to have to tell you its meaningful and have to carve it out like we did this past quarter that would be actually a great story to tell you so we will continue to try to carve out when we think it makes sense to carve out that variable comp obviously were a dynamic company and things are moving but just to be sure everybody understands we are not changing our commitment we are back on our way from the billion that we made in february were going to get those cost savings ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood all right thanks daryl operator and we will take our final question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just back on the merger savings billion youre reiterating that net number thats pretty clear but i mean you have of the savings already and only of the branch closures you expect to exceed on the non branch footprint part so why not increase that estimate what would it take for you to increase that estimate truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 billion net or have you already increased the gross merger saving number which you havent given to us and reinvesting some of the proceeds and does that all add up to positive operating leverage in or not you didnt quite guide for the year thanks kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so mike youre right i mean there are many parts that move into this and were really just trying to anchor on the minimum of the billion were not trying to hold out what we think is possible in terms of beating that but some of the things ive talked about in terms of i mean we could have more branch closures than weve anticipated were not predicting that at this moment but thats certainly a possibility we certainly are going to be intensely focused on the expense optimization and there are huge opportunities for duplication across the enterprise areas that we can technologically invest in and reduce ongoing expense run rate so the billion related to basically putting the two companies together the other things we do more in terms of transformation and additional opportunities we find whether its a non branch office space maybe we exceed that target maybe we get a few more branches we certainly are very optimistic in terms and expect to focus on doing that we just want to be clear about what weve said we can do and then hold out the opportunity that we can probably beat that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay without using up my second question in terms of a gross number i know that youre investing a lot back is your gross number going higher as part of that net kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp go ahead daryl daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp so i will tell you we are investing more than what we originally thought mike but we think these are the right investments that were making in our people technology digital all for the right reasons so we are making more investments than what we originally thought we havent communicated that number publicly but just know that we are going to get our net savings maybe well see that at some point but let us get the billion first and right now we are making a lot of investments in the company as we are moving forward and youre seeing it in the results look at our revenues look at our account growth that were getting i mean were doing really really well in the midst of a lot of conversions which could really distract a lot of the businesses we are performing at a very high level mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then the second question a lot of talk about fees a lot of talk about insurance so im bringing in the big guns its my peer colleague at my firms insurance analyst elyse greenspan i know shes spoken with the insurance managers at your firm before but elyse if you want to ask the question on my behalf go ahead truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 elyse greenspan q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah thanks so the one question i had you guys posted adjusted organic growth in the fourth quarter which seems like a pretty impressive number relative to some of the other companies i cover and then also given kind of the impacts that weve seen from covid on the industry as you guys think about from some of your other comments it seems like growth would continue on an organic basis right to kind of just come in above that if you could just maybe expand there and then also could you give us a sense you guys are little bit different than others obviously have good ph tales of wholesale and retail in your insurance business has the organic from both of those businesses has one been outperforming versus the other or are they kind of consistent christopher l henson a head of banking and insurance truist bank thank you for your question this is chris youre right we did finish around and based on what i see now i think around would be certainly a good number for call it the first half of next year well call the last half when we get a quarter in or so so feel very very good about it but i must tell you if pricing holds and i believe that it will and if the economy does begin to turn via vaccinations getting pushed out to the country and were able to see then better new business growth as a result some example of what we saw this fourth quarter could it be better i think its possible that it could so i think the opportunity really kind of all those cylinders have opportunity to move i do think the growth is going to be dependent upon what happens with covid and economy and kind of get all that going but assuming we do get vaccination out midyear stimulus first half of the year i think it bodes well for organic growth in that business for sure and your question about is the margin better in one than the other strategically as a bank the reason we want exposure to both if we werent a bank it probably wouldnt matter as much but what were really interested in is for this business to provide good downside protection when credit markets are challenging and you can see it this year this past year organic growth for the year i think is pretty solid given the backdrop and the reason we do that is because wholesale or retail are going to operate indifferent to each other so youre going to depending on whether youre in hard or soft market one is going to help balance the other out were interested in the combination of the growth there so certainly a little bit better contribution from wholesale today than retail but theyre both making nice contributions operator and ladies and gentlemen that is all the time we have for questions i would like to turn the conference back to mr ryan richards for any additional or closing remarks ryan richards director of investor relations truist financial corp okay that completes the qa portion of our call thank you abby and thank you everyone for joining us today i apologize to those with questions that we didnt have time to get to we will reach out to you later today and we wish
