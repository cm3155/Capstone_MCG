18jan2024 with that ill turn it over to bill william henry rogers chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks brad and good morning everybody and thank you for joining our call today before we discuss our fourth quarter results lets begin with our purpose on slide as you know truist is a purposedriven company committed to inspiring and building better lives and communities id like to take just a few moments to highlight some of the ways we demonstrated our purpose during through truist community capital we committed nearly billion to support more than units of affordable housing this helped create more than jobs and serve more than people in low and moderate income communities this year also our teammates impacted organizations and causes through their charitable giving and more than hours of volunteer service in addition we started a small business community heroes initiative which empowers our branch teammates alongside our virtual small business specialist leveraging our digital solutions to proactively connect via caring conversations with small business owners who tirelessly work to serve our neighbors create jobs build our communities and help drive our economy so those are just a few examples of a meaningful work were doing as a company to have a positive impact on the lives of our clients our teammates our communities and our shareholders as we work to realize our purpose all right so lets turn to some of the key takeaways on slide truist reported solid fourth quarter results adjusted earnings after excluding several discrete items that impacted our results the largest of these items of course is a billion goodwill impairment charge mikes going to provide more details later in our call but this is the result of our annual impairment test which we conduct each year as of october 1st so importantly this charge is noncash it has no impact on our liquidity regulatory capital ratios the payment of our common dividend or our ability to do business and serve our clients on an adjusted basis we reported net income of billion or a share which excludes the impact of the impairment charge the industrywide fdic special assessment and a discrete tax benefit in addition pretax merger related and restructuring charges of million negatively impacted adjusted eps by per share most of these charges were related to our costsaving plan despite these discrete items in the quarter were pleased with our underlying results as you can see on the slide our solid performance was defined by several key themes first we made strong progress on our organization simplification plan during this quarter since these initiatives were announced in midseptember weve reduced head count realigned significant elements of our organizational structure to improve efficiency and to drive revenue opportunities in and beyond as a result of these efforts and others through the fourth quarter marks the second consecutive quarter weve seen our expenses decline although the first quarter will experience typical seasonal expense headwinds were on track and fully committed to delivering on the cost initiatives that we outlined in september which will limit adjusted expense growth to flat to up to in while also continue to invest in initiatives for our core clients technology and risk management although asset quality is normalizing off historically low levels were encouraged that nonperforming loans declined during the quarter while we continue to build our loan loss reserve considering the uncertain economic environment consistent with our capital planning strategy our cet1 ratio increased basis points sequentially to although were committed to building capital our balance sheet also remains open to core clients as our primary capital priorities are supporting the financial needs of new and existing clients and the payment of our common dividend so before i hand the call over to mike to discuss our financial performance in more detail let me provide truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 a quick update on our progress were making on improving the experiences for our clients well do that on slide truist continues to see improved digital engagement trends with strong transaction growth over the last year mobile app users grew versus the fourth quarter of which is contributing to increased transaction volumes which now account for of total bank transactions as shown in the chart on the left growth in digital transactions is primarily reflected by increased zelle usage as clients continue to value efficient payment and money movement capabilities and while this is certainly positive truist still has a meaningful opportunity to shift the transaction mix even more towards digital specifically by leveraging our t3 strategy which is the concept that touch and technology work together to create trust that further enhances the client experience and drives greater digital adoption and efficiency our goal is to create seamless experiences for our clients by offering more selfservice capabilities to enhance the overall client experience truist assist is a perfect example of this concept since launching in weve seen increased client adoption with one third of the total interactions represented in the fourth quarter of alone additionally of the conversations were completed using the automated assistant this quarter as we look into we expect accelerated adoption of truist assist which should lead to additional operational efficiencies for truist overall im pleased with the digital progress weve made in and excited about the opportunity to further leverage t3 in and beyond that so let me turn it over to mike to discuss our financial results in a little more detail mike michael b maguire chief financial officer truist financial corp great thank you bill and good morning everyone for the quarter we reported a gaap net loss of billion or per share as bill noted reported earnings per share were impacted by several items detailed at the top of slide those include a noncash goodwill impairment charge of billion a special fdic assessment of million and a discrete tax benefit of million excluding these three items adjusted net income was billion or per share in addition mergerrelated and restructuring charges primarily related to severance and branch consolidation associated with our costsaves initiatives negatively impacted eps by another before providing further details on this quarters underlying financial performance i do want to provide some additional background on the goodwill impairment charge that occurred during the quarter we test our goodwill for impairment annually on october 1st this years test resulted in an impairment of billion the impairment was primarily driven by the continued impact of higher interest rates and higher discount rates and a sustained decline in banking industry share prices including truists share price importantly as bill noted in his opening remarks this is a noncash charge and has no impact on our liquidity no impact on our regulatory capital ratios our ability to pay our common stock dividend or to serve the needs of our clients moving on to the results for the quarter total revenue increased basis points sequentially due to a more modest decline in net interest income than expected adjusted expenses declined or if excluding the impact of tih independence readiness costs our net interest margin improved basis points to during the quarter we added basis points of cet1 capital in the quarter and increased our alll ratio by basis points in light of ongoing economic uncertainty finally our tangible book value per share increased on a linkedquarter basis due primarily to the impact of lower interest rates on the value of our available for sale investment portfolio next well turn to page to cover loans and leases average loans decreased sequentially reflecting our ongoing balance sheet optimization efforts and overall weaker client demand average commercial loans decreased primarily due to a decrease in ci balances primarily due to lower client demand in our consumer portfolio average loans truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 decreased primarily due to further reductions in indirect auto and mortgage overall we expect average commercial and consumer balances decline modestly in the first quarter driven by our ongoing mix shift toward deeper client relationships deemphasizing lower return portfolios and the effects of continued economic uncertainty moving now to deposit trends on slide average deposits decreased sequentially as growth in time deposits and interest checking was more than offset by declines in noninterestbearing and money market balances noninterestbearing deposits decreased and represented of total deposits compared to in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter of during the quarter consumers continued to seek higher rate alternatives which drove an increase in deposit costs albeit at a slower pace relative to recent periods typically total deposit costs increased basis points sequentially to down from a basis point increase in the prior quarter which resulted in just a basis point increase to our cumulative total deposit beta to similarly interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points sequentially to down from a basis point increase in the prior quarter which also resulted in a basis point increase to our cumulative total interestbearing deposit beta to going forward we will continue to maintain a balanced approach focusing on core relationships staying attentive to client needs and striving to maximize the value we can add to relationships outside of rate paid moving to net interest income and net interest margin on slide for the quarter taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by linkedquarter due to lower average earning assets and higher rate paid on deposits partially offset by favorable hedge income reported net interest margin improved basis points on a linkedbasis quarter while net interest margin expanded in each of the last two quarters we expected to contract in the first quarter due to an increase in rate paid on deposits partially offset by continued improvement and spreads on new and renewed loans turning to noninterest income on slide fee income increased million or relative to the third quarter the linked quarter increase was primarily attributable to higher service charges on deposits which were up million in the fourth quarter due primarily to the third quarter being impacted by million of client refunds lending related fees increased million linkedquarter due to higher leasing related gains and other fees declined million due to lower equity income fee income was down on a like quarter basis as lower investment banking and trading deposit service charges mortgage banking and other income were partially offset with higher insurance income and higher lending related fees next ill cover noninterest expense on slide gaap expenses of billion increased billion linkedquarter due primarily to the previously mentioned billion goodwill impairment charge the million fdic special assessment and a million increase in mergerrelated and restructuring expense partially offset by a million decline in personnel costs excluding these items and the impact of intangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense declined sequentially or excluding the impact of million of tih independence readiness costs the decrease in adjusted expense was driven by lower personnel expense due to the execution of our cost savings program resulting in head count reductions as well as lower incentive compensation to reflect our performance in these improvements were partially offset with higher professional and outside processing expenses adjusted noninterest expenses were essentially flat on a likequarter basis as bill mentioned we are pleased with the progress that weve made on the cost savings initiative that we announced in september our original goal was to eliminate or avoid expenses of approximately million over a to 18month period which would help us manage our expense growth in to flat to up the largest category of savings targeted in our plan was a reduction in force driven by a companywide assessment of spans and layers of management the elimination of redundant functions and the restructuring of truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 certain business lines weve made significant progress here ftes are down from june to december with the final set of reductions underway in the first quarter the second category we highlighted included cost savings opportunities that would be driven by organizational simplification examples include reimagining our go tomarket strategy and cre simplifying our benefits programs and rightsizing our branch network and related staffing as part of these efforts we anticipate reducing the size of our branch footprint by nearly during the first half of in addition to lowering head count and simplifying our organization we also reexamined our technology investment spend through this process we have rationalized rescoped or delayed the start of a number of projects primarily in noncore areas we estimated restructuring costs related to this initiative to be approximately million or of our initial million goal so far we have incurred around million of charges related to the program mostly driven by reductions in force and the facilitiesrelated decisions we would expect to recognize the bulk of the remaining costs in the first quarter its clear to state here that the work is never done and we continue to assertively manage costs but we feel confident that we will achieve our flat to up expense target for okay moving on to asset quality on slide asset quality metrics continue to normalize in the fourth quarter but overall remain manageable nonperforming loans declined linkedquarter while early stage delinquencies increased basis points sequentially due to an increase in to 89day pastdue consumer and ci loans included in our appendix is an updated data on our office portfolio which represents of total loans we are pleased that nonperforming and criticizing classified office loans decreased modestly linkedquarter while we increased the reserve on this portfolio from at september to at yearend during the quarter our net chargeoff ratio increased basis points to basis points the increase in net chargeoffs for the quarter reflects increases in our other consumer indirect auto and ci lending portfolios partially offset by lower cre losses we continue to build reserves as provision expense exceeded net chargeoffs by million our alll ratio increased to up basis points sequentially and basis points yearoveryear due to ongoing credit normalization and greater economic uncertainty consistent with our commentary last quarter weve tightened our risk appetite in select areas though we remain maintain our throughthecycle supportive approach for highquality longterm clients turning now to capital on slide truist added basis points of cet1 capital in the fourth quarter through a combination of organic capital generation disciplined rwa management and this quarters tax benefit partially offset by the fdic special assessment with a cet1 ratio of truist remains wellcapitalized relative to our minimum regulatory requirement of that became effective on october we remain committed to building capital and do not have plans to repurchase shares over the nearterm we continue to be disciplined with our rwa management strategy as we allocate less capital to certain businesses though we have been clear that our balance sheet remains open to core clients our primary capital priorities are supporting the financial needs of new and existing core clients as well as the payment of our per share quarterly dividend in addition we continue to believe that truists capital flexibility with truist insurance holdings is a distinctive advantage we estimate that our residual ownership stake provides greater than basis points of additional capital flexibility and we continue to evaluate our strategic options with respect to tih the table in the center of the slide provides an updated analysis of our aoci at year end during the fourth quarter the component of aoci attributable to securities declined from billion to billion or by billion due to the decline in longterm interest rates during the quarter and finished essentially flat when compared to yearend aoci related to our pension plan improved from billion to billion which is a level that will remain static throughout truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 based on estimated cash flows and todays forward curve we would expect the component of aoci attributable to securities to decline from billion at the end of the fourth quarter to billion by the end of or by approximately we continue to feel confident in our ability to meet the requirements and build capital under the proposed phasein periods based on our assessment of the proposed capital rules we have refined our estimate for the impact to riskweighted assets under basel iii and now expect a midsingledigit increase in risk weighted assets compared to our previous estimate of a high singledigit increase finally as it relates to the proposed rules for a longterm debt requirement we estimate that truists binding constraint is at the bank level and that the shortfall is approximately billion we remain confident that we will be able to meet the proposed requirement at both the bank and the holding company level through normal debt issuance during the phasein period as part of our regularway funding plan we issued billion of longterm debt during the fourth quarter of all right ill now turn to page to review our updated guidance looking into the first quarter of we expect revenues to remain flat or decline by from gaap revenue of billion net interest income is likely to be down to to in the first quarter which is more than we experienced in the fourth quarter due primarily to one less day a smaller balance sheet and some pressure on our net interest margin driven by rate paid we expect linkedquarter improvement in noninterest income due to higher insurance and investment banking and trading income partially offset by lower other and lending related fee income adjusted expenses of billion are expected to increase by due to normal seasonal increases related to payroll taxes and higher incentive accruals for the full year we expect revenues to decrease by to our balance sheet and interest rate sensitivity continue to be positioned as relatively neutral which is in line with our longterm goal our forecast assumes that net interest income troughs in the first half of and then remains relatively stable assuming five reductions in the fed funds rate with the first reduction coming in may in addition we assume that insurance continues to grow at highsingledigit rate while investment banking and trading should benefit from a recovery in capital markets although we anticipate adjusted expenses rising four percent in the first quarter due to seasonal factors full year adjusted expenses are still expected to remain flat or to increase over adjusted expenses of billion which includes tih independence readiness costs our expense guidance of flat to up also includes million of tih independence readiness costs in terms of asset quality we expect net charge offs of about basis points reflecting a continued normalization of loss rates across our consumer and wholesale loan portfolios a lower denominator from declining loan balances and our strategy to be proactive in resolving higher risk portfolios finally we expect our effective tax rate to approximate or on a taxable equivalent basis ill now turn it back to bill for some final remarks william henry rogers chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks mike so looking back at im really proud of the work our teammates accomplished which helped accelerate our transformation into a simpler more profitable company as i discussed in september our transformation is centered on improving efficiency and realigning certain aspects of our leadership and operating model within our three current operating segments wholesale consumer and insurance to increase our efficiency and drive revenue opportunities in the third quarter weve realigned and consolidated several lines of business within consumer and wholesale including creating a single enterprisewide payments group consolidating three commercial real estate units into one and consolidating four consumer lending platforms to leverage technology and capital resources during the fourth quarter we announced significant leadership truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 appointments within consumer and wholesale and we formed a new operating council composed of key business leaders from across the organization these leaders will help improve accountability efficiency and ultimately drive better growth across our platform while controlling risk all of which are primary benefits of the simplification plan these strategic organizational changes designed to improve longterm revenue growth are complete and were beginning to see the impacts from our cost savings initiative to that end and as mike discussed our costsaving efforts are going well and reflect the planning and execution that was ongoing throughout these costsaving efforts are funding important investments in our risk management infrastructure and core businesses while also helping to offset natural expense growth in other parts of our organization we accomplished all of this while growing net new deposit accounts strengthening our balance sheet through organic capital growth and strategically allocating our capital to core businesses looking beyond the fourth quarter our top priorities for include growing and deepening relationships with our core clients leveraging our more efficient platform to gain market share achieving our expense target and enhancing truists digital experience through t3 all while building capital and maintaining strong risk controls and asset quality metrics we believe theres a significant potential to help our clients achieve their financial success by delivering our commercial consumer payments investment banking wealth and insurance capabilities throughout our existing footprint investment banking weve increased our market share across virtually all of our capital markets products weve seen a significant increase in the number of lead roles across several products including investment grade equity capital markets leverage finance and asset securitization in addition our mindshare with clients and our key industry verticals has never been stronger as we continue to expand in new verticals that are primed for growth as capital market activity recovers across our wholesale businesses recent changes in client coverage strategies should allow us to focus more intently on opportunities in the middle market where we can bring unique perspective given the breadth and depth of our platform especially in areas like investment banking and payments were seeing solid yearoveryear growth and cib referral revenue from commercial banking as we continue to deliver valueadded advice and capabilities to our clients truist wealth which beginning in will be part of our wholesale business segment has seen positive asset flows in of the last quarters by bringing the wealth business over to wholesale well go to market as one team to deliver business transition advisory solutions to commercial and corporate clients in consumer im encouraged that customer satisfaction scores have returned to premerger levels in addition net new checking account production was positive in as we added new consumer and new business accounts and during the fourth quarter we acquired more than accounts through our digital channel including new to truist while the branch network presents opportunity for further efficiency in certain markets were seeing improvements in productivity due to excellent teammate execution and investments in technology as evidenced by the increase in net new deposit accounts were encouraged by this increased productivity and well look to make investments in branches and select key growth markets in and beyond so in conclusion the fourth quarter was solid but we acknowledge theres more work to do as we strive to produce better and more consistent results in the future we view our fourth quarter performance as another step forward in that direction were making strong progress on areas in our control including managing our expenses building capital and realigning our business so that it is wellpositioned to serve new and existing clients as markets recover were firmly committed to achieving our expense target in while we will continue to build and allocate capital towards core clients in our home markets we view as a distinctive competitive advantage this heightened focus will lead to increased franchise and shareholder value over time truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 let me close by just thanking our teammates for their incredible purposeful leadership in teammates your focus and commitment fuels our confidence in and beyond thank you so with that brad let me turn it back over to you for our qa brad milsaps headinvestor relations truist financial corp rocco at this time will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session as you do that id like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one followup in order that we may accommodate as many of you on the call as possible today question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and todays first question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning mike i was wondering if you could unpack the outlook for the net interest income in a little bit including the assumptions around deposits and whether taking out some fed cut assumptions would change the outlook much how sensitive they are thanks michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah good morning john no problem so i guess if you think about nii i mentioned in the prepared remarks that weve got five cuts in our base plan the first in may and then really another ph at each meeting with the exception of november on balances we mentioned i think loans probably a touch of pressure in the first quarter maybe down less than and then relatively stable on the ci side we see a nice a more stable outlook for the year on the consumer side a bit of pressure deposits sort of picking up where we left off in the fourth quarter so down call it a or so in the first and then declining but i think albeit it may be a declining rate over the year so thats i think the primary piece john we think about repricing and i think youve heard from peers as well on this i mean probably a bit of caution warranted around the betas so we think that some of the higher the faster stuff that moved on the way up probably moves fast on the way down but theres still going to be a considerable amount of repriced lag and so i guess those are the sort of fundamentals and then i guess you asked about cuts and whether there were fewer i think we mentioned were relatively neutral versus our base case on the five cuts so whether there are three or four maybe six or seven cuts i think we have less sensitivity there that being said i think a scenario where there are no cuts that would be or significantly delayed cuts that would be a headwind for us john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 okay and then just a quick one on expenses the guide for adjusted expenses in the billion area what expenses should we keep in mind for a modeling that are outside that adjusted so you have some amortization thats usually i guess around million and then some merger restructuring expected this year michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah youre right on the amortization that would be excluded on the ph mercs we mentioned weve got million left on our cost savings initiatives based on estimates in the first quarter theyll be down versus last year so should not be as much noise in as we saw in john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and i guess just other ph mercs or incremental operating costs like any of that throughout the year that we should keep in mind or placeholder for some of that to occur beyond the first quarter michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp maybe just to touch john but i dont expect that to be a significant factor in our john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay great thank you operator thank you and our next question today comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler companies thank you good morning everybody mike i was hoping you could talk a little bit about sort of how you might see loan demand projecting through the years certainly understand and appreciate the comments about a little more pressure on loan balances in the early part of the year and then more stability but just curious how youre thinking about whether demand can come back if we begin to get some rate cuts more macroeconomic clarity et cetera michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah scott i think youre right i mean i think in our base case were assuming a couple of things the five cuts we think will benefit demand a touch but to the extent that thats underestimated that would be welcome news and i think we mentioned from a ci perspective we do expect modest growth in that portfolio at least in sort of the second quarter third quarter and beyond i think most of the pressure that were seeing for the year is still on the consumer side others may weigh in on other factors bill william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i would say part of the pressure on the consumer side is were creative as were really reducing some of our focus on indirect as an example and thats somewhat offset by the growth in sheffield and service finance truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 but that doesnt sort of isnt a perfect balance in there so the consumer reflects probably a little more of our own action and capital allocation than where we are from a market perspective and then i think as mike said on the ci side were open for business so were going to serve our markets and i think weve got really really strong markets and when i think recovery comes it will come disproportionately faster in our markets and if that happens sooner well see the benefit of that and well be a recipient of that because we are i think gaining share in most of those capabilities and then the other part i just mentioned is that like when were winning were winning more disproportionately so on the ci side particularly just to more of the deals are in left leads as an example so if we look at some of our portfolio last year were winning more on the left side so thats got more profitability and more tailwind in terms of an ability to expand those relationships so i dont know if were being conservative to use that word but i think weve got to sort of see whats in front of us and hopefully by the end of the year if the rates turn out as we all forecast well see a little spur in the economy and i think well be direct beneficiaries of that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler companies perfect thank you and then mike just a more minutiaeoriented one obviously great to see the nearly billion improvement in aoci curious if you have an estimate for whats your adjusted or sort of fully loaded common equity tier ratio is relative to the stated michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah scott i can give that to you so on a stated basis we finished the quarter at if you look at the new balance from an oci perspective and this would include the afs security as well as the pension thats about a impact so that would take you down to call it i guess and then the other factors like the thresholds and the rwa inflation we mentioned earlier in the call that we have done more work around an estimate for what the rwa impact might be under basel and also little more work on the thresholds call those another percent so that walks you down to low r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler companies okay perfect all right thank you very much operator and our next question today comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey bill im wondering if the optimization maybe you could call it truist is going fast and deep enough and i do recognize two items one you mentioned headwinds in the past from rates regulation and retooling and second your new efforts the million savings program less head count less branches ahead but then i look at the core efficiency numbers im like oh this is not what we signed up for right i mean slide i think lists your core efficiency at in and now youre guiding worse for and your premerger target was so are you guys doing enough and doing it fast enough to optimize william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 yeah mike i think an appropriate challenge as always weve done a lot so i think im really encouraged by the momentum and you can see it really in the third and fourth quarter and you see that significantly in particularly the expense declines and were committed to what we talked about in september i think our million plan im really proud of our teammates im proud of our leadership they really got the sleeves rolled up and got after it so the intensity thats in this company right now about being more efficient i feel is demonstrably better and being able to apply that over this more simplified organizational structures where we see the benefits so if you think about as ive made in my comments i mean sort of that process is complete so now this intensity these efforts these initiatives we apply that over a much more simplified business model and the decisions that leaders are making i think are just better stronger decisions which lead us to a more efficient company longterm mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc my followup on optimization ill give to my colleague insurance analyst elyse greenspan elyse elyse greenspan q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah thanks mike and good morning to everyone on the insurance side i know there has been press reports on the potential monetization and sales process of that asset so i was just hoping that you can provide an update to us and just where you stand with that process william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah so i think weve said pretty clearly that the insurance business creates a capital opportunity for us and then mike outlined that in a lot of specificity weve said clearly that were always evaluating alternatives and were going to do the best thing for the insurance business and the best thing for truist going forward and i dont think as it relates to any specific timing and those type of things i dont think i should really comment beyond that elyse greenspan q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp great thanks operator and our next question today comes from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning i wanted to ask you to expand a little bit on your outlook for credit noticing the npa decline this quarter and you have an expected chargeoff normalization path im just wondering what youre seeing in terms of what areas of the portfolio youre expecting to see that loss trend higher and the most and just your general sense of just how the customer set feels in terms of that certainly implies a good ramp from here but one thats controllable so just kind of juxtaposing that npa decline with your expected ramp in losses thanks truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp this is clarke thanks for the question our nco guidance as mike said it assumes were going to continue to see normalization occur both in consumer and wholesale weve already seen a lot of it in the consumer side we have a higher mix as bill said of highermargin consumer finance businesses and less relative mortgage and prime auto thats a factor on the loss assumption but i think the biggest one that youve pointed out were working really hard to get ahead of any potential areas of stress think cre office and so our guidance also reflects opportunities to be opportunistic to work through if we see more challenges in that space as that structural risk unfolds so we hope to do better but were assuming were going to work hard to make sure that we get ahead of any risks ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks clarke and just one followup just wondering i know you said that youre expecting a hopeful bounce in the investment banking business just wondering where those level of conversations are and just given your mix of business where we might expect to see that either come back sooner or have a lag relative to the environment thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah great question and the good news is weve got a really good balanced investment banking business so and seeing some positive things on a lot of the different buckets so if you think about equity capital markets i mean theyre starting to come back i think were starting to see some ipo components of that our pipeline there is probably the strongest its been in a long time and pipeline as active book runner when and if all that comes to bear i think thats well just have to thatll be a little bit market dependent on the debt side sort of the high yield investment grade i mean youve got a lot of maturity sort of running off in so theres sort of a natural refinance opportunity i think again sort of that will be where clients are projecting where they think rates are going to come so theyve got a lot of natural things they have to do and theyll have to pick that point of demarcation where they want to start the refinancing side and then the ma pipeline is really strong weve spent a lot of time and energy with our verticals and being really relevant so the size and scope of some of the things that were doing are proportionally higher but weve also built this really great pipeline with our transition advisory business with our commercial clients and weve got more in the pipeline there than we closed all of last year just as an example so thats sort of that core bread and butter kind of work and then we have things like public finance which was sort of a nascent business for us months to months ago and now is starting to build up some momentum and as we see public finance opportunities start to grow so we have a lot of cylinders that are working that i think can offset each other and would be a good reason that we would be confident in a pretty nice recovery on the investment banking side it will be like everything else a little bit quartertoquarter dependent but hopefully a little less volatility for us given that weve got a lot of cylinders running ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thanks for that bill truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah operator and our next question today comes from erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning the first question is for bill bill mike is not saying anything too different about loan growth from the rest of your peers for that being said i think obviously one of the genesis of the merger of equals is this combined franchise in this footprint that was better than everybody elses so i guess my question here is how much of your current adjusted capital state right now is sort of impacting still how youre thinking about growth in going to market and clearly theres going to be a lot of questions on use of proceeds if you do sell the rest of truist insurance holdings but how much different is your approach going to be to market if at all if you do monetize tih william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yes let me answer the first part of that as well so i think thats a great question and if you look at sort of the barometer i was trying to say this earlier on sort of where we go i think we will reflect our economy and our opportunities so and well just have to see sort of how that gets unleashed going forward and i think the correlation will probably be more directly seen in the ci side because were as i mentioned before not just a capital preservation but or optimization but really more around optimization around return and sort of looking at our core and noncore so weve pulled the throttle back on some of the consumer side that we consider to be less capital efficient so thats got a little bit of an overhang in terms of where we look at this i think if we go into and youre trying to answer your question i think the barometer for us ought to be on the parts of consumer where were investing and ci overall and as i said earlier i think when we see the recovery well see it more disproportionately in our markets and we should reflect that so i think thats exactly right but the net of your whole question were not capital constrained in terms of the opportunity for growth in the business in core business and the places where were investing erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just a followup question for mike one of your peers had framed it this way so i think the investors found it helpful but you did mention earlier that you had cautioned on the betas to the downside and your first cut is presumed to be may considering a lag could you give us a sense of what your range of assumptions is in terms of downside betas for the first basis points of cuts thats embedded in your guide michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah erika im not its a great question and one were spending a lot of time on look i mean i think initially out of the gates and if these come call it ph at a time and you think about the first are the first four for us i think the first half of that its going to be really pressured by the by guys still repricing up across the retail business in certain products and segments so i guess my use of the word cautionary is thinking about kind of where were ending up right now on a cumulative beta perspective and just acknowledging that were going to truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 be lower than that out of the gates for certain but i dont think if you think about our nii outlook i think youve got a pretty good sense for how were thinking about the reprice trend and we mentioned we think in the first quarter in sort of a static rate environment were going to be down to on balances and day count and then a touch worse on rate paid and from there as we start to see the cuts in our case we think we flatten out and are pretty stable erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess i just wanted to followup maybe bill and mike on the goodwill charge im assuming its more than a mathematical exercise and its hard for me to imagine that higher rates are structurally bad for banking organizations with good deposit base which is the case for truist so to some extent i guess the read through is some of the deal synergies tied to the suntrust bbt merger no longer look as appealing as they did at the time of the deal announcement one is am i missing something there and secondly bill just so youve talked about a bunch of strategic actions is it fair for us to expect that if we look a year from now we will see very clearly some of the synergies be it in terms of market share gains efficiency tied to the deal where investors can start getting onboard with the franchise michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah ill go on the first one ebrahim thanks for the question you sort of said hey i assume its sort of not just math i mean or maybe you said it is mathematical and thats right i mean at the end of the day we do it an annual test for impairment there are i mean thousands and thousands of factors that go into this work there are customary valuation approaches you evaluate each reporting unit if you think about it the factors that are significant that we cited in our prepared remarks is that you do have a very youve had degradation in operating conditions for the industry you had a significant decline in broadly speaking bank stock valuations truist market valuation as of the time again we do this test as of a certain day each year in our case its october 1st so all those factors are considered and influence the outcome but at the end of the day the estimated fair value is below the carrying value and thats the output but again just to reiterate this absolutely zero impact to our financial condition or how we think about our opportunity or our strategy or what were doing william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and its just done by segment too mike michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 yeah thats right you look at the various reporting segments the reporting units for us which are the consumer and wealth business at least in corporate and commercial and then insurance william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and then on your second question hopefully what i was indicating is that process has started so if you look at the net new account gains were seeing the growth in primacy accounts the growth in market share and investment banking so those things are actually underway and happening i think theyll continue to accelerate theyll continue to build theyll continue to manifest as you said both on the revenue and both on the efficiency side i think you actually pointed out that youll see both sides of that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc well thanks for that and just one quick followup when we look at the commercial real estate multifamily book there are a bunch of like southeast markets that are probably seeing a fair amount of supply coming through any concerns i mean what are you seeing in the multifamily cre today and any markets where you are particularly focused on in terms of oversupply over the next year or two william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah ill get clarke to comment as well but yeah there are part of the great part of our markets is we have a lot of inmigration so weve had a lot of building in anticipation of that so if you think about some of our larger markets austin orlando i mean some of the suspects where youve seen a little bit of that ill get clarke to comment on the quality of the portfolio sort of the multifamily large developers that were in and longterm the migration positive continues so i was looking at some data indiscernible just to make a comment broadly on that within our markets last year we added a metropolitan indiscernible so just think about that in context so we added about ph net inmigration into our market so the overall demographics are good but i think in fairness to your question we would probably have a little bit of a shorter term watch item versus worry item maybe clarke you can clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp i agree with you bill overall we still think multifamily longterm is a very favored asset class and some of the current challenges from our perspective relate more to a margin or current debt service coverage risk issue given rate increases higher operating costs and to your point the new pipeline supply thats coming on and we just view that very differently than the structural risk we see in office as an example so were working with our borrowers to address their specific situations as we look out and how theyre going to address this impact again so what we would expect more temporary increase in watch lists some nonaccruals but nowhere near the same loss risk exposure you see in office and i would remind you that theres very active secondary placement sources a lot of equity sources willing to come in and the clients that we have to bills point they want these assets and theyre supporting those so we think its a manageable risk even though there is some shortterm pressure ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you so much truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 operator thank you our next question today comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning sorry i missed it but have you guys talked about what your targeted capital level is obviously youve said going from here with no buybacks in the nearterm and again with the impact on the rwas from the basel iii endgame proposals but how are you thinking about kind of targeted capital levels over the medium and longer term thanks william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah matt for right now were at in building and so i think until we get more information until we sort of understand the dynamics a little bit more and think about our company construct i think the best thing for us right now is to be in an organic capitalbuilding mode so we havent set a specific target but i think 10plus for the shortterm to mediumterm seems a good place for us to be landing right now matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and as you think about kind of the 10plus mediumterm is that including aoci because obviously youre already 10plus now and should accrue capital fairly quickly this year ph i would think given earnings and not much balance in growth michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah no matt i mean i think were just in the moment were in were looking at spot capital were thinking about transitioned capital measurements if we phase into new rules and were looking at fully phasedin i think the whole industrys thinking about it that way so i think when bill thinks about i mean i think about it like on a transitional basis staying at or above is probably what bill is implying but i think shorterterm is like were building capital were going to continue to do that through organic earnings and hopefully well have a little more visibility on this rule and can give you a little better sense for kind of a mediumterm target matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning bill good morning mike truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hi gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bill when we go back to the original merger i think if i recall correctly there was a targeted return on tangible common equity and youve just discussed about the capital levels basel iii being higher than what i presumed to be lower numbers back when the deal was announced can you share with us are you still thinking return on tangible common equity is a reasonable goal or you can attain it even with these higher capital levels that you and the industry has to carry william henry rogers a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean i think gerard if we go back to that was a different world and a different environment both in terms of where we were from a rate standpoint and where we were from a capital standpoint regulatory standpoint now weve got basel iii in front of us so i think in fairness certainly short and mediumterm is not necessarily in the windshield but i think we can continue to perform at a high level in terms of rotce and so all the efficiency opportunities and things were building revenuegrowing those are things that are continuing to build on that so i think to think about us being a top performer in that category versus setting a specific target that was constructed at in a different environment is maybe a different way to think about it gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then coming back obviously you guys talked about credit quality you referenced mike about commercial real estate in your opening remarks and you just talked about multifamily and truist has always been good on its credit so my question on the commercial real estate in the office area and maybe this is for clarke can you kind of draw a line for us from early when there wasnt really any problems before rates started to go higher in downtown office or they or maybe just emerging and incrementally its clearly deteriorated clarke can you share with us is the deterioration accelerating on a sequential basis in the office market or have we seen the rapid acceleration of down values real workouts taken chargeoffs and going forward yes youre still going to see higher chargeoffs probably but the actual incremental deterioration is lessening or worsening can you share with us from that standpoint clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp great question we talk a lot about gerard and so i would say as i mentioned as opposed to multifamily we view the risk in the cre sector as more structural and it still will take some time to play out over the next couple years and the way we think about it everyone with credit in the sector is exposed to the risk and so the big challenge will be for those that have large concentrations which we dont so we feel good about that and our strategy has been to try to identify the risk early and work through with borrowers to address all options and youll you see that in how we approached risk rating accrual status and reserves so thats kind of where we are right now we feel good about our efforts but to your point we still think about the fact there are very few trades real trades today so its hard to know what real price discovering whether weve hit the bottom of the cycle or not i think everyones trying to recognize that and so youve seen that acceleration truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 what i think is still left to come incrementally is we are still seeing as leases fully mature companies lessees resizing their space needs and so you can have performing loans today and a good outlook but you really dont know until you see the leases mature the other thing i would say is we are seeing some interest some early interest on longterm investors coming in and that may help so i would say still more to come gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator thank you we have room for one final question and that comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks for taking my question i wanted to come back to the nii guide and i appreciate all the detail on loan growth and deposit betas can you talk about how we should think about the impact of securities repricing and the impact of swaps as we think through that nii michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah no problem on the securities repricing side not a huge factor as you know our speeds we mature call it billion to billion per quarter and so probably not as big of an impact in terms of upside for but as you think about the swap book i think i mentioned in the fourth quarter we had a little bit of a tailwind to the tune of call it million to million relative to  our outlook for really interestingly enough the first half its a tailwind with some of the pairs in our portfolio but we do have some received fixed swaps that will become effective throughout the course of the year which will later in the call it first half begin to mute the benefit and then by the second half create a headwind but for the full year impact its actually negligible at least based on the current curve but thats all factored into our nii outlook manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and just as we think through the sensitivity to the different rate environments i think you mentioned some forward starting swaps is there any more color any quantification there or anything else we need to think through in terms of the impact on nii from any swings in the forward rate assumptions michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp look i mean like we disclosed this i mean if you look at our swap portfolio weve got about billion of receivers on today about billion of those will be effective sort of day one this year and by the end of the year most will be effective but again thats incorporated into our outlook manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you truist financial corp tfc corrected
