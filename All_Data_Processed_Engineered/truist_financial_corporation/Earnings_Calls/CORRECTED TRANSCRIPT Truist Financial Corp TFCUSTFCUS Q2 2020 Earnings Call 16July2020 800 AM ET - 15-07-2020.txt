really really involved with our teammates creating an inclusive and energizing environment really focusing on trying to empower our teammates to learn and grow and have meaningful careers and i think weve done a good job across the board with regard to all of our stakeholders in optimizing their longterm returns we did all that consistent with our values of trustworthy truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 caring one team success and ultimately trying to provide a sense of happiness for our teammates and all of the people that we have a chance to inspire and support if youre following the presentation on table i just want to point out some of the things that weve done because i think in todays world this is as important if not more important than the actual numbers because our communities need a lot of help weve been really focused on living our purpose youve heard about our truist cares philanthropic initiative where weve pledged million to rebuild communities some of the things we do and are really really exciting for example were doing technological support in areas that are unserved or underserved with regard to internet and wifi capabilities were using that to support automated reading capabilities in these areas because these kids are sheltered in placed at home and dont have access easily to learning were supporting our communities doing a lot of work with cdfis in terms of supporting small businesses minorityowned businesses womenowned businesses feel good about that just to give you a perspective over the last few years on our onup movement we provided about million people with tools to provide their financial confidence since weve done over community projects weve touched over million people through our financial foundations program which is focused on financial literacy in high schools weve reached more than million high school students and since the merger of equals a very short period of time weve provided million in financing to support affordable housing units creating new jobs across our footprint weve been really focused on addressing racial and social inequity were expanding our efforts to advance equity economic empowerment and education for our clients our communities and our teammates im very proud to say we observed juneteenth holiday by giving our people time off we had a virtual town hall with over of our teammates that i was able to cohost along with ben crump and it was a really really good dialogue good discussion weve had over days of understanding where we bring together teammates and give them an opportunity to just dialogue and talk about whats going on challenges that they face those have been really really great sessions i participated in some and found them to very very informative and helpful were in the process of doing even more town halls weve conducted unconscious bias training so were doing a lot to try to help our communities and our teammates weather through the storm and get better through the storm and i feel really good about that ill show you how its playing out with regard to second quarter highlights on slide were very pleased that we had a taxable equivalent revenue of billion it was up but as you know that was merger timing affected we did have adjusted net income of billion feel good about that diluted earnings per share on a gaap basis were but our adjusted basis earnings were which was very very strong relative to the environment our return on average common equity on an adjusted basis was return on average tangible common adjusted was and i was very pleased that our adjusted efficiency ratio was which is very strong in this environment our asset quality in terms of actual metrics which you can get more detail on from clarke were actually fantastic but as we all know that was substantially impacted by a lot of the cares act decisions around forbearances et cetera so we know that it will get worse and thats why were prepared well in terms of our reserving for our future allowances truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 we felt good about our fee income got robust capital markets activity residential mortgage was fantastic insurance brokerage operation which really really is important in times like these had a record quarter we continue to have very good expense discipline on a core basis and our common equity tier increased by to so we felt very very good about that if you look on page i just want to hit a few of these material special items that affected the quarter we did have securities gains so these were nonagency mortgage securities that we had for a while they had special gains and some risk of downside loss on those gains and so it was a good opportunity for us to take those that did provide million of some pretax gain or diluted share now we used most of that to extinguish debt we took a loss on that of million before tax that improves forward run rate which daryl can give you detail on but that was very good that was a negative then we did have substantial mergerrelated restructuring charges of million that was negative and then as weve explained to you we do have incremental operating expenses that are related to the merger that are technically merger related that we call out in a category but theyre not a part of our run rate going forward so we consider those to be unusual and thats so when you net through all that it would be a positive impact of about if you look at slide just a few comments with regard to loans it was a very interesting quarter for loans i mean at the beginning of the quarter loans were booming we were having land draws like everybody else that were substantial we were engaged in ppp where we were the thirdlargest ppp producer producing about billion in those loans we were happy to do that although it was very hard in terms of supporting our small business clients there was not much normal loan human activity in the quarter so it was just kind of an unusual quarter our average balances were billion versus billion in the period so you can see what happened we advanced up all the lines and then they started paying down so now of the covidrelated line advances have already been paid so that activity was kind of a rollercoaster it settled down now and we feel good about where we are consumer loans decreased slightly in this stressed environment just because people broadly speaking are spending less we did see a decrease in residential mortgage on the loans that we hold but our mortgage business in general is booming we had mortgage applications of billion in second quarter and we originated billion in the quarter so we were really really active in that and frankly moving resources into the mortgage area because thats a very very important area for us we did have substantial activity increasing loans in indirect which was primarily due to huge demand for loans to finance recreational and power sports so we are seeing some robust activity in some categories some temporary robust activity in others the underlying normal activity is id say relatively stable not going down not going up theres just not much going on right now for reasons you would understand so we feel overall good about our loan book and loan activity and we think were wellpositioned as we go forward when confidence returns to be able to meet the needs of our clients just a couple of comments with regard to deposits on slide deposits are booming our noninterestbearing deposits were billion up billion on a linkedquarter basis total deposits were up billion on the same linkedquarter basis i will tell you that the majority of that is core but there are surge balances related to line draws ppp loans and government stimulus we believe there continues to be a flight to quality and were the truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 beneficiary of that business accounts drove about of the growth in dda so that was what you would expect businesses drawing out lines investing into deposit accounts et cetera deposit mix in the second quarter consisted of noninterestbearing deposits which is very strong are interestbearing on money markets and savings were our cost of average deposits and average interestbearing deposits decreased basis points from basis points respectively down to and bps respectively so its a very very strong story for deposits i will say that we have a real opportunity in terms of our interest bearing deposits at basis points we didnt move them down as aggressively in the second quarter maybe some did we wanted our clients to have time to adjust but we see it as a real opportunity for us as we move into third quarter and were already taking a very bold and decisive action with regard to that so let me it turn now to daryl for some more detail daryl n bible chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you kelly and good morning everyone today i want to cover key points from the second quarter discuss current business conditions and provide an update on cost saves turning to slide net interest margin was down basis points purchase accounting contributed basis points to reported net interest margin versus basis points last quarter core net interest margin was down basis points impacted by lower benchmark interest rates higher fed balances and covid related deferred interest the yield on loans and leases held for investment decreased basis points due to lower interest rates lower purchase accounting accretion and deferred interest on loans with forbearance the yield on the securities portfolio decreased basis points primarily due to higher premium amortization asset sensitivity moderated as a result of tighter fixed rate assets lower fixed rate federal home loan bank advances and lower benchmark interest rates mitigating down rate scenarios were projecting loan yields or we are protecting loan yields ph with great force on new commercial obligations and modifications and well continue to manage down deposit costs we expect to report net interest margin to be flat for the remainder of the year turning to slide noninterest income includes million in security gains related to the sale of nonagency mbs excluding these gains core noninterest income was up million investment banking and trading income increased million on strong core trading activity and elevated counterparty reserves in the prior quarter residential mortgage income was up million on strong volumes and improved margins partially offset by lower servicing due to higher prepayments refi was of originations and gain on sale was basis points reflecting very favorable conditions in mortgage insurance income increased million up to record levels primarily due to seasonality and pricing organic revenue grew versus like quarter service charges on deposits decreased million mostly due to reduced incident rates card and payment related fees were affected by lower transaction volumes due to lower consumer spend wealth income decreased million as market devaluation impacted wealth fees truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 turning to slide noninterest expense increased million mostly due to a million loss on debt extinguishment million increase in merger and restructuring charges and million increase in incremental operating expenses related to the merger higher mergerrelated expenses reflected professional services associated with integration and increased severance charges we remain highly disciplined around core expenses excluding the abovementioned items adjusted noninterest expense increased million this was mostly due to higher covidrelated operating costs and performancebased incentives partially offset by lower marketing and client development expense we anticipate covidrelated operating expenses will decrease as we continue to take measures to protect teammates clients and communities we identified areas where cost savings can be accelerated including personnel expense corporate real estate and thirdparty spend we now believe we can accomplish of the billion in net cost saves by the fourth quarter this year up from we previously shared our ftes declined we expect further reductions throughout this year we also closed branches in nonoverlapping markets turning to slide asset quality remained relatively stable reflecting moderate deterioration in certain asset quality ratios and improvement in others our npa and npl ratios increased and basis points respectively to and basis points most of the npl increase was in cre commercial construction and leasing portfolios net chargeoffs increased basis points to basis points on average loans and leases our provision for credit losses totaled million reflecting stressed environment and the allowance build of million for the second quarter in a row this allowance build has essentially selffunded by purchase accounting accretion the allowance was of loans and leases up from our coverage ratios remained strong at times net chargeoffs and times npls the combination of our allowance and unamortized fair value market is very robust at of total loans our asset quality ratios were tempered by relief from the cares act our teammates have been very responsive to our clients helping them navigate the pandemic as of june client accommodations totaled billion in consumer loans billion in commercial loans and million in credit card balances this represented an increase in the loan portfolio about a quarter of the clients who received an accommodation continue to make payments on their loan we expect third quarter asset quality metrics to deteriorate in response to covid stress across the loan portfolios turning to slide as you can see on the table on the left our exposure to vulnerable industries remains low and reflects diversification we achieved from the merger of equals outstanding loans to sensitive industries totaled billion versus billion however billion was increased due to ppp loans excluding ppp loans sensitive industry outstanding increased only million or about energyrelated balances were essentially flat and our oil and gas portfolio continues to be weighted towards lower risk sectors hotel resort and cruise line outstandings increased to of loans held for investment from last quarter this reflects the inclusion of hotel reits and real estate secured by hotels which were not previously included outstanding balances to restaurants increased modestly to of loans held for investment from at the end of march outstanding balances on leveraged loans totaled billion down from last quarter we are actively managing our sensitive industry portfolios this includes deep segment reviews and reflecting credit adjustments in our risk rates truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 turning to slide the allowance increase of million to reflect the consideration of increased economic stress the sensitivity to affected industries and the proactive grading changes to reflect the current environment the estimation process incorporates multiple economic scenarios including assumed likelihood of worsening conditions our assumptions include doubledigit employment followed by sustained high singledigit unemployment as we extended gdp recovery throughout the twoyear forecast period we also considered the effect of government relief packages and payment accommodations on expected losses and made adjustments as needed to address model limitations taking into account the acl amount of billion and dividing it by truist and two heritage companies net chargeoffs for the past months we come up with a times coverage ratio which we believe is strong turning to slide truist is very wellpositioned relative to peers in a strained credit environment the table on the left utilizes dfast results this shows our estimated loan loss rate of ranked third best among peers and is basis points better than the peer average we also have significant loss absorbing capacity of billion due to combination of the acl and the unamortized loan marks our loss absorbing capacity represented of endofperiod loans and of billion of dfast stress losses this slide shows how the merger of equals enhanced the risk profile of both companies and produced a resilient and more diversified balance sheet turning to slide sic our capital ratios improved nicely across all ratios and remained strong reported cet1 ratio improved to from the first quarter cet1 ratio benefited from current earnings lower risk weighted assets and purchase accounting accretion we issued billion of preferred stock during the second quarter to further improve our capital position our second quarter dividend and payout ratios were the truist board will vote on a resolution to approve the third quarter common dividend of at the july meeting turning to slide we continue to see strong liquidity and we are prepared to meet the funding needs of our clients through this challenging environment second quarter average lcr was and our liquid asset buffer was our access to secured funding sources remains robust with over billion in cash securities and secured borrowing capacity holding company cash is sufficient to cover months of contractual and expected outflows with no inflows turning to slide we continue to be encouraged by the acceleration weve seen across the digital platform digital commerce grew during the yeartodate period through may we also saw a increase in the number of active mobile app users over the past year digital transactions also increased nicely mobile check deposits were up from last may to this may the acceleration in the digital has resulted in increased paperless adoption as statement suppressions are up one of the motivations of the merger was to combine technology with touch to generate trust with our clients and to be able to meet their needs that is why we are really pleased that the legacy bbt mobile app u earned the number one jd power ranking in the us banking mobile app satisfaction study in addition lightstream legacy suntrust national online lending division won the number one ranking in jd power us consumer lending satisfaction study among personal loan lenders these are great examples of the best of both capabilities as truist advances its diverse digital and online capabilities as it relates to guidance we withdrew our annual guidance due to the uncertainty going forward for the third quarter we are providing limited guidance based on the third quarter linkedquarter changes versus second quarter we expect taxableequivalent revenue to be down to after excluding onetime security gains from the sale of nonagency mbs factors impacting revenue include a reduction in earning assets mostly due to the truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 line draw repayments seasonally lower insurance income and lower residential mortgage spreads and servicing income in addition investment banking and trading faces a robust second quarter comp we expect the reported net interest margin to be flat and core net interest margin to increase modestly core noninterest expense adjusted for merger costs and amortization are expected to be down to we also anticipate net chargeoffs to be between basis points and basis points now let me turn it back to kelly for an update on the merger closing indiscernible and qa kelly s king chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks daryl so if you follow along on slide i just want to mention a few things about how were doing the good news is our cultural development is fantastic in fact i would say that it is accelerating because of the challenges because people are facing some extremely difficult challenges daytoday and that really kind of pulls groups together the sense of team play in the organization today is phenomenal far better than i could have ever hoped for so we feel great about how were doing in terms of the organizations coming together we had some really good recent developments we branded truist insurance and truist foundation we introduced advisor desktop to heritage bbt financial advisors and we were able to consolidate social media platform leveraging truistcom our conversions are in many cases right on schedule for example institutional broker dealer mortgage origination and wealth are right on schedule for the second half of this year and the first half of next year we did tell you last quarter and throughout the quarter that we were reassessing the core bank conversion because of all of the challenging circumstances that weve all faced those include amongst others a strategic reallocation of resources for the covid response when all of this hit we had to focus on what was the most important at the moment for example we spent a lot of our it and other support resources in the ppp program and developing portals for our clients to do automatic deferrals and developing automatic portals for automated scheduling so people can schedule appointments with our people remotely we had workfromhome transitions for truist and our outsourced vendors as we got all of the computers into everybodys homes that just takes a little bit of time and we did experience some critical vendor disruptions that hampered our conversion activities so we want to take all that into account we want to make sure we do it right do it well thats the most important and so we now anticipate the core bank conversion will be in the first half of versus the second half of its not a dramatic change but it is one we wanted to report out to you and we think its the best way to continue to provide the highest quality service for our clients still we are committed to our billion of net cost saves as daryl described and were very pleased that were able to pullforward expense savings around facilities vendor spend and personnel cost so we would now expect of the billion on an annualized basis to be available to us this year by the fourth quarter and then we stay on track with for the fourth quarter of and then the full of fourth quarter so its just a little bit of pullingforward in versus a little bit less than so we feel good about all of that and think that will go very very well wrapping up on slide just a couple of comments with regard to the value proposition we offer youve heard me say before and i still continue to believe this is a fantastic organization the combination is excellent it is truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 fantastic for our shareholders and the reason is this it is an exceptional franchise with diverse products services and markets its the sixthlargest commercial bank in the united states we have strong markets share in vibrant fastgrowing msa markets none of that has changed we have a comprehensive business mix with distinctive capabilities in traditional banking capital markets and insurance and clearly coming together weve already experienced what we thought would happen which is that together we get the bestofbreed best talent best technology best strategy and best processes and we really saw that this quarter with a strong performance in investment banking and insurance one from suntrust one from bbt came together beautifully just like we thought it was we have a unique positioning to deliver bestinclass efficiency and returns we feel very strong about the cost saves as weve said and the projected efficiency ratios that we talked about we still feel very confident about our mediumterm targets of rotce in the low adjusted efficiency in the low common equity tier ratio of were closing in on that right now so this is going to be a bestinclass efficient highly profitable organization and largely thats because we have strong capital and strong liquidity and we have a very resilient risk profile very strong prudent experienced risk management team conservative risk culture diversified benefits from the merger weve stressed very well which you just saw and so we have a very defensive balance sheet which is insulated by purchase accounting marks combined with the cecl credit reserves so all of that we knew would be true we didnt know it would be tested as much as it is being in this environment but it really is proving to be the kind of underlying or building support that we need to be a very resilient organization in this environment and this is a very challenging environment i will say to you that as difficult as it is as difficult as it is to predict whats going to happen in the future i believe the economy is resilient i believe ultimately we will be okay i believe the american people will do the right thing to create an equitable society with hope an opportunity for everyone everyone wins when we have an opportunity for everybody to have an equitable future and thats what were working very very hard to personally i believe well be a lot better off if we can get a lot more emphasis on love and caring for each other and that will create a bright future for america and everyone in it im going to turn it back now to ryan ryan richards directorinvestor relations truist financial corp thank you kelly alan at this time will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 question and answer section operator yes sir operator instructions all right and well take our first question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi hi good morning kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp hi good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc kelly i just wanted to dig in a little bit on the expense side you mentioned that youre pullingforward the cost saves over the next couple of quarters and maybe you can remind us how far along on that million you are already as of and then give us some sense in the discussions you had to accelerate that in what else you found that maybe you could add to the profitability opportunities here in as well i know you kept to flat but knowing you im sure you unearthed a few other potential items of cost saves kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah betsy as you would expect were doing a deep dive in all of those areas to be sure that we can continue to provide highperformance profitability metrics even as we orchestrate through this difficult environment the pullingforward is just frankly getting more aggressive than we had even originally planned with regard to vendor renegotiations weve got a ton of buildings as you might expect duplicative buildings some small some large weve got a major task force working on that and weve decided to be very aggressive in terms of consolidating and eliminating a lot of these buildings and thats pretty immediate cost reductions when you do that we have a very aggressive personnel rationalization plan in process and a good bit of that is already underway in as you alluded to it will begin to slow down to the bottom line more in and as we get executing on it the plans are welldeveloped and now its just a matter of executing our plans now keep in mind that while were not calling this out as we head into the remainder this year and we also have some really good opportunities in terms of revenue our integrated relationship management program is going extremely well and we are redoubling our efforts with regard to that because this is a time when our clients need us more than ever and so we are across the organization focusing on generating opportunities to help our clients and of course in so doing we generated additional revenue for us so weve got all of these expense initiatives but theyre huge revenue initiatives as well which gives us great confidence truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 were focusing on the expense review from day one we didnt add in revenue opportunities as a part of projecting but i could just tell you that the development along the way in terms of realizing those revenue synergies is going far better than i would have ever expected including all of the covid difficulties related to that daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp and the only thing i would add to that betsy is that in the first or second quarter we had some covidrelated expenses we talk about them but we dont carve them out we believe that those covid expenses will moderate over the next quarter or so so youll be able to really see those cost saves once theyve moderated but were probably in the to range right now and with the costsavings that kelly said that we are actively working on by the fourth quarter well have of it we believe in the fold kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah and id also mention too betsy we in addition to those items daryl mentioned we had covidrelated reductions in income including money back on credit card purchases the other types of incomes nsf reductions waivers so pretty big number we havent been trying to call that out because i think most people are trying to kind of do the same thing but it is material betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right so maybe if you could just as a followup to the question just talk a little bit about how youre anticipating the forbearance programs that you have in place fading from here im not sure are you going to be retaining people in forbearance until further notice do they roll off at a specific point in time and maybe speak to both the loan side as well as the fee waivers that you just mentioned clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp hey betsy this is clarke ill take the credit accommodation i know daryl and kelly gave you the statistics there i would tell you this we are seeing a substantially lower new incidence of accommodation requests i think much like others the big wave was early on and so our focus now is actually on the expiration of the initial forbearance that we granted and whether theyre going to need additional relief or not so what we have been doing on both the wholesale and the consumer side weve marshaled substantial resources were actually reaching out to these borrowers whether theyre individuals or whether theyre businesses and trying to anticipate what they think their needs or what their current financial situation and outlook is so that we can get a sense of what lies ahead and i can just tell you it depends on the individual situations were seeing anywhere from i think theyll need another accommodation to some asset classes that might be so were trying to take all that into consideration be compliant with the cares act but were going to be much more thoughtful about the second wave to make sure that were not kicking the can down the road and so as were doing these reviews were also effectively where its appropriate deferring the interest accrual and daryl talked about that were actually got a reserve there if we think theres higher probability of redefault and then were also through this regrading thats definitely included in our modeling in our loan loss reserves betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and on the fee waiver side is that something that will sunset at some point truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yes so betsy on the fee waivers we think its about time to kind of eliminate those to be honest we had a lot of discussion about it but weve concluded that weve got to let our clients ease back into normal life planning and financial planning and so weve terminated that christopher l henson a headbanking insurance truist financial corp yeah betsy this is chris i would add under truist cares we did things like cashback for grocery and pharmacy atm fees for waivers for clients and nonclients we did for the eip a 30day relief credit for those who did not have balances and so all those things to the point i think kelly and daryl were making will come back to us we also had some service charge to bank cards ph debit card challenges which will come back at least or certainly a large portion of that will come back in as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so this should be over starting in into and really full run rate by type of concept to that thats what im hearing christopher l henson a headbanking insurance truist financial corp okay its certainly not full run rate at yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you very much kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks betsy operator well go next to john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the core nim i know daryl you mentioned that the core nim should be up modestly in the third quarter can you discuss what the drivers of that would be and if you would expect similar moderate expansion quarterly thereafter on the core side thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so john were doing several things around that obviously you saw us exit billion of advances from the home loan bank they had rates north of we eliminated the negative carry that we had at the fed and earning basis points so that was an immediate lift to run rate thats happening as we speak now kelly touched on earlier how we are continuing we have opportunity to continue to cut our core deposit rates we think that will come down substantially over the next two quarters so we feel good about that if you look at on the commercial area of all new originations and modifications got floors embedded into their loans and we think that will protect some of the yield from that perspective and the other things were looking at right now its kind of tricky on what assets you can grow at this time that helps run rate and capital but there are strategies like the ginnie mae buyout program where we are adding to that were looking at maybe adding back our jumbo correspondent production that will add more earning assets there ltv ph seems to have variable risk weights the student lending thats governmentguaranteed so all those are capitalfriendly that help run rate will be positive and were also looking at moving some of the mix out of the fed balance into the investment portfolio to some extent so all those i think will increase our core margin which will help offset a slowdown as you have your reported margin you have less fair value accounting coming through every quarter were trying to offset that with all these actions that were taking so we can keep our margin flat john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay good all right thats helpful and then on the i guess lets say on the expense side first i know you indicated that you pushed back the core systems conversion and you cited some vendor disruptions have you chosen a vendor for the core systems and will you be announcing that and then separately on the efficiency side on the mediumterm targets at the low just want to see like how much higher do rates need to be to make that a reality and what type of timeframe i guess thanks kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp so on the conversion we have the full plan developed we have time lines developed we have all the parties lined up in terms of executing and as i said were executing literally as we speak in terms of the noncore bank conversions but for the core bank all of that is lined up and moving forward its a big deal so its challenging but were very confident in terms of moving forward in the time line we talked about truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 and daryl can comment but with regard to the efficiency ratio youve heard me say over the years thats just a tough ratio because youve got a numerator and a denominator but look were at adjusted in this environment without getting the benefits of the expense cuts from the conversion materially and the revenue enhancements so thats why we feel very very confident getting into low from where we are today the adjusted efficiency ratio will wash out to the normal efficiency ratio because all the merger unusual costs and all will go away and so we feel very confident about that so even if rates stay relatively low im optimistic we could get down to that kind of level obviously if rates go up then that really helps daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah the only thing i would add to that john is that no matter what environment were in with putting the two companies together and the scale and efficiency we have we believe well be a top tier provider in efficiency in any market condition that you have there so if rates are higher well have lower efficiency numbers if rates stay lower maybe they wont be quite as low as what were saying but we still should be in the top couple of our peer group from that perspective so we feel very good about that john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it william h rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp and john this is bill maybe just a john its bill just a little clarification maybe on the provider is the vendor disruptions that weve had really are on the support and tech side so our core providers that weve selected for all the conversions that we talked about trust and brokerage and deposits and all those those are all in great shape and were proceeding well and so the challenge has really just been in the tech support john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thats helpful thanks bill william h rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp okay operator your next question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just wanted to dig into kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 good morning michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc some of the fee income businesses obviously insurance was very strong i think last year you guided about yearonyear can you give some color there and just maybe if we could expect any momentum to continue on the i bank and trading side thanks christopher l henson a headbanking insurance truist financial corp sure im happy to mike this is chris yeah really excited about the core its a record core as kelly alluded to earlier and the three drivers of organic growth are really pricing retention and new business and so prior to covid they were all kind of hitting in all cylinders and what you have now is new businesses driven by gdp and uncertainties of covid are tailing down a bit but pricing is really robust so what we had in the core was pricing last quarter was up in the range closer to this quarter and its anticipated well continue to see acceleration for the remainder of this year and into ill touch on why in just a minute client retention was in retail in wholesale also very strong but what youre seeing there is a bit of a shift with the covid uncertainties youre beginning to see some of the standard carriers that support retail to really sort of pull back and refer to wholesale which gets underwritten in the es markets that supports the wholesale so over a period of a year youve seen a little bit of maybe a couple percent down in retail but up about in wholesale and that really underscores sort of the power of our diversified model because we play in both channels in fact at wholesale you might even get this to a touch of our margin in todays world so that we actually benefit in that situation new business production where we were up maybe doubledigits last quarter were down but what i would say there is while and thats really driven by gdp whats going in the economy uncertainties of covid but i would say that our overall outlook is much more positive because of the price firming i just talked about and we also saw in the quarter a more stable exposure units than we expected we just did not see the business failures it was just a limited number of business failures and also the growing excess surplus lines volume the shift from retail to wholesale that i had commented on just a minute so in the corridor what all of that gave us was organic growth in the range and i think what i had said was sort of flat to two and we were right on the upper end of that range so we felt very very good about it in a market that i think some might would have expected flat to slightly down just another touch on pricing you really are seeing upward momentum i think were going to continue to see all coverage types were up except workers comp all sizes were up at least in the sort of range we saw things like do up liability professional liability up business interruption up i mean those are big numbers so what we would expect in the third quarter because of what daryl had said earlier was were going out were coming out of the second quarter which is our strongest quarter of the year to our weakest quarter of the year the third quarter which is purely seasonal so youll see something down in the range but for the year were still forecasting organic growth while it would be soft in third or fourth quarter were still seeing it in low singledigits for the remainder of it was really pricing sort of leading the way so we feel really strong really good about it truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 william h rogers jr a president chief operating officer director truist financial corp this is bill ill take investment banking and trading side we had a good quarter in investment banking the things that we want to see equity origination investment grade were all really strong i think as kelly noted it really is highlighting the value of the franchise and i feel really good about the relationships with the commercial community bank and the pipelines that were building and the dialogues that were having with clients all that being said its hard to predict quartertoquarter just because theres just more volatility and theres some market dependency but overall momentum in that business i think is just a real strength of the truist merger on the trading side we just have a lowerrisk clientdriven trading business that just has lower betas than these other businesses so our core trading business was good in the areas that we wanted to be good in derivatives market and trading again via the franchise via the relationships taxable fixed income ph so with trading and the real difference was the cba that recognition was just much lower in this quarter than it was last quarter and presuming the rate environment and credit environment thats stable that could continue so just a really good longterm momentum quartertoquarter a little harder to predict christopher l henson a headbanking insurance truist financial corp and mike its chris again i might just comment on mortgage we had as kelly alluded to just an exceptional mortgage quarter this quarter and daryl said that we might expect it to tail down a touch i would tell you production we think is going to be just as strong maybe even a little stronger its just that as the industry brings on more capacity the margin is going to tail down a touch so i mean were in the kind of range this quarter and that combines retail at and correspondent is a touch lower too but youre still going to probably have in the mid to upper kind of margin and youve got additional service and cost as daryl pointed out but still going to be a very strong year i mean the kind of year that would have been frankly i mean the kind of quarter that wouldve been a year indiscernible so very substantial kind of numbers overall michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very very helpful just one followup question if i exclude the items that you called out for noninterest expense on a core base it looks like the expense were billion given the pullforward of some of the cost savings and lower incentive comp is it safe to assume that expenses would be down in the third quarter thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so in my prepared remarks mike i said that wed be down to linkedquarter excluding out those items that i mentioned there so we definitely believe its going to have a ph trajectory down in third quarter and probably pretty good in the fourth quarter as well michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc sorry i missed that thanks for taking my questions operator all right your next question comes from dave rochester with compass point truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on your just back on the margin appreciated your comments on the drivers going forward i was just wondering what your assumptions were for the curve between amortization there and then your opportunity to lower deposit costs if youre assuming you can sort of hit that precycle low for the cost or if you think that you could actually take those even lower given all the liquidity you have which should seem like a fairly reasonable assumption daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so what i would tell you is that we are at basis point right now if you look what our average in june was we were at basis points so we will probably be in the low maybe peers through or basis points in the third quarter probably by fourth quarter well be in the teens on heritage bbt side the lowest we got in the last crisis was basis points i dont have with me what heritage suntrust was handy but were clearly headed lower i think were going to be lower than before and our assumptions on the margin outlook we basically use the forward curve forward curve basically has no rate movements for the next couple years pretty flat curve so were not anticipating any increase were just trying to take actions that we think are prudent that we can take in this stressed environment to help improve core margin which should help alleviate some of the offset of the fair value accounting accretion indiscernible david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc and any help on reduced securities indiscernible daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp we always tend to buy securities with a premium or less weve done that for many many years because we dont like to have a lot of ph leap year volatility but youre seeing cprs in the marketplace now at so theyre prepaying pretty fast if you look at our investment portfolio were in the mid to high70 billion range our cash flows coming off are about billion to billion a quarter right now so you are getting some of that amortization that were seeing there so were reloading and trying to add to it but its hard to find securities that dont have big premiums so were being as selective as we can from that perspective truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc are you seeing other opportunities to move the needle with more fhlb paydowns daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp we are almost all out of federal home loan bank paydowns i think we have billion left or whatever thats going to roll off i think later this year so if we were to do anything right now im not saying we would but the only thing left you can really do from a liability perspective is tender any outstanding debt we have not made a decision to do any of that but thats the only thing well have to and then as we aggressively push down deposit rates we will be good to our clients but nonclients were going to push them down really really low and if they leave thats okay because we have huge balances at the fed david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great and then maybe just one switching to credit you have some acceleration of the pandemic in your markets did you guys make any overlays in your cecl process for that and what that can mean for the reserving next quarter if you see that accelerate or youre already assuming that in your base case that youll get further acceleration clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp hey dave this is clarke we did consider that and as weve gone through i mentioned these deep dive reviews by ph segments that would include geographies as well and even things like individual property levels and submarkets so we have considered that and tried to take that into consideration on our estimates which obviously did assume further deterioration david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great and then just maybe as a last followup to that what are you guys hearing from business customers on the ground on how theyre feeling about the pandemic in the background and is there any outside caution there does that mean more deposit growth or less loan growth going forward just any thoughts there would be great kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp so from what were hearing from clients i would say pandemicwise our clients for the most part our small business clients are probably the ones most impacted right now because they just dont have the same reserves that larger companies do so larger companies depending on what scenarios youre in some are under stressed some are actually doing really well its a really broad spectrum there from that perspective from a indiscernible theyve been actively grading down the more stressed credits so youre seeing that reflected and that showed up in our allowance numbers on that but from a deposit we have huge deposit truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 growth the dda growth that we got the billion that kelly mentioned of that was coming from businesses that will probably moderate over time and if you look at the growth that weve gotten from our interest checking and mmda most of that is coming from personal and i think that that will also get spent and moderate over time it all depends on the government comes up with more stimulus checks then that might add back to the balances there david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc thank you kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp one of the interesting things were finding that i must admit i was a little bit positively surprised about is the resiliency of our clients when we talk to our regional presidents and our people that are dealing directly with clients in many many cases theyre saying well the clients feel pretty good given the environment and the reason is because they learned their lesson years ago in the great recession and when this hit they acted fast they cut their expenses they tried to be creative in terms of generating other revenues and theyre hanging on much much better than i might have expected now some of the very tiniest micros of businesses are having the hardest time because they dont have all they dont have any rainy day fund they live kind of daytoday but for small most of our small business clients they have some resiliency but mostly they responded very fast now if it hangs on a long time it just will be hard but if this recovers reasonably quickly i think we may be pleasantly surprised at how well our business community actually performs christopher l henson a headbanking insurance truist financial corp and this is chris kelly just to reinforce your point over half our regions are actually on goal for the lending business today and whats really good to see is two of the top regions are like west virginia virginia west some of our core corest of core regions and so i absolutely agree with what youre saying operator all right your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc hey guys this is amanda larsen on for ken you mentioned that the covid19related deferred interest reduced nim by basis points was thats just accounting or was that a choice that you guys made for prudence to not accrue interest on customers that are experiencing duress daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so just based on our prior experience amanda in the last crisis we know that some of the people that are on payment deferral are going to end up in chargeoff and we dont want to have any surprises so were using a lot of metrics depending portfoliospecific on what percentages people will carry through and might not be able truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 to make their payments and it varies by each portfolio but this quarter it was around million for us and thats what we backed out of our net interest income from an accrual basis so we did a little bit in the first quarter now were continuing to manage and monitor that but we think its prudent accounting just to basically make sure that we are going to accrue what we think were going to get paid back on amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc okay great and then separate question can you provide updated thoughts on the capital stack you guys issued billion of preferred bringing your preferred to roas up to like do you expect to continue to run with this bucket kind of oversized relative to sort of optimization level like whats your thought process here and how does it tie in with the strategy of the overall funding base daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so amanda we are just taking it day by day and as we know certain things but right now were still in a stressed period so were going to keep our capital stack pretty strong we do have the ability to call some of the preferred out over the next year or two if things were to lighten up that would be about billion or so but right now i think we want to keep our capital really strong we continue to evaluate and make sure that we have enough were managing the capital for stress and what could come our way from that perspective but we have a lot of flexibility and well make prudent decisions and well let you know when we make those decisions right now but right now were happy with the capital that we have amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc okay great thanks for taking my questions daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah operator all right next question comes from erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning just one followup question if i may as we think about billion in terms of your loan loss reserve is the majority is reserve building behind you clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp hey erika this is clarke obviously im sure youve heard this from others we follow our process we look at our models our economic scenario assumptions our client behaviors and the deep dives around the specific industries and we do everything we can in the cecl process to estimate what we think those lifetime losses are truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 so obviously if those scenarios play out differently our clients perform differently than we had forecasted then that would adjust what we would need to do in the future so for now we think weve done the very best estimate we can with the information that weve been able to evaluate erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator all right next question will be from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning kelly good morning daryl daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp morning kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc clarke can you share with us when you look at the portfolio today and i know this is going to take some guesswork but months from now when were following through this crisis do you think the greater credit losses may show up in the consumer side of the house or the promotional side and when i think of commercial where in the commercial side of the house is the greater stress is commercial real estate clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp great question gerard and we debate that every day certainly for us right now while were concerned about the consumer were watching it very closely follow the stimulus support and the savings and different things its holding up relatively well even if you take out the forbearance benefit that we provided i think our concern right now is more on the commercial side if you look at our reserve allocation even again for this quarter it was plus on the wholesale side so i think thats what were looking at things like what does how does the hospitality or some of these sensitive areas or other structural changes in office or other property types so i think the wholesale side based on various certain industry segments and cre types are where were putting most of our focus right now gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good darryl when we looked at the dfast results it seems like your results werent as strong as they should have been in ppnr and even some of the credit losses is there any way of addressing that with the fed or you just really have to just take what they give you and just work your way through it truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp gerard we did do a press release earlier that week when after the numbers came out on thursday we said that we thought potentially that our numbers on provision we thought should have been a little bit lower its hard to know when youre doing incurred method you have to really know when the loans come off and when they stay on the books and to know when it has to get reloaded with new originations and if you dont have that data i think its hard to actually forecast that i think in their model methodologies they say they try to account for it but you really need to have good instruments and forecasting to know what loans are coming on and off then on fair value accounting if you have ppnr models that are based upon historical results this is probably the worst time you could model ppnr because the company just came together in december and we had maybe three weeks of purchase accounting so you really didnt have anything you did have one year of noninterest expense and that appropriately got loaded into our run rate and were going to have that for the next year or two and that will fade away but fair value accounting is real its alive we had over almost billion in the first two quarters of this year that we basically were able to use that from an earnings perspective and we kind of think of it that it kind of helped fund our allowance build it wasnt exact but it was like 90plus percent what the amount was it just happened that way but didnt really have any earnings impact off of our core earnings because of that so we feel over time that our history will be loaded with fair value accounting and that will get done appropriately we are actively meeting with the fed theyre here as you know constantly and were giving them all the information sharing everything that we have and we hope down the road that we will get better results and we still think longterm our moe we should be top tier performing not just on the loss rate but also on the ppnr and on the capital resiliency it might take two or three years to get the expenses out of our run rate but hopefully by year three from now were going to be in the top quartile if not the best in our peer group gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator all right next question comes from brian klock with keefe bruyette woods brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning gentlemen daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp good morning kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey and thanks for going over the hour and taking my question just a real quick credit followup for clarke i guess can you talk about the reserve build for the second quarter and kind of how much of that could be related to either the downgrades that you mentioned earlier and then maybe you can talk about the change in indiscernible assets quarteroverquarter too please clarke r starnes a chief risk officer truist financial corp great question youll see our indiscernible assets when we file the q but i mentioned this deep dive and regrading process we went through so effectively on the wholesale side weve actually in the sensitive industry areas weve done deep dives and as an example on the hospitality area we covered of our total exposure there on a borrowerbyborrower basis and reenter every one of those and done that through a similar process for the other sensitive industries and then for any client thats had an accommodation and so weve marshaled a ton of people to do that and so were getting realtime information that has certainly impacted our grading so we proactively downgraded a good number of credits the biggest stress weve seen in the downgrades has been in hospitality and things like cre retail so all of that is baked in to our second quarter estimate and as i mentioned about 80plus of the additional increase is related to those to wholesale and particularly to those sensitive industry areas brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great color thanks for your time guys daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp thanks operator all right well next go to christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks just a quick one for daryl on the ppp forgiveness is that something that you can kind of have the certainty about in terms of how it might impact the yearend and first part of next year daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp i can tell you our assumptions chris this is obviously a new product and well see how it all plays out but if you look at the fees obviously we set them up on the loan system and they get amortized to go over a twoyear time period but as they get the forgiveness and then get paid back all of that left accretion to that loan would actually come into earnings in that time period so our assumptions are that we believe of our production in ppp will get forgiveness we believe that this is the timing that we put in our models in the fourth quarter of the will get forgiven of the will truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 get forgiven in the first quarter of and then the remaining of the in quarter two of the other we think will go all the way to term from that perspective thats our estimate its about our best guess we did modify it so we pushed out a little bit ppp is very fluid it tends to change a lot so well see how things would react but this is our best estimate right now christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it and thatll impact the margin when it happens but i imagine youll break that out so this would be a onetime event indiscernible quarters daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah well mention that i mean its in our run rate now a little bit because youre still amortizing basically the feel over that twoyear time period so like for this quarter it was worth about million of our net interest income for the second quarter christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay great thats helpful thank you very much guys daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp thank you kelly s king a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp have a great day
