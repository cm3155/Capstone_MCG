officer truist financial corp thanks ankur good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call this morning truist delivered a good second quarter reflecting our improving momentum after the integration and the resiliency of our diverse business mix in a volatile market environment our financial results modestly exceeded the guidance we provided in april with several puts and takes loan growth was strong and broadbased net interest margin expanded significantly due to higher interest rates and our strong deposit franchise credit quality remains excellent and were pleased by our relative and absolute performance in the recent stress test in light of these results our board will consider resolution to increase the common dividend by at its july meeting this quarters performance combined with improving client experience trends and dramatically lower merger cost reflects initial benefits of our shift from integrating to operating while there is still work to do such as stemming elevated operational losses closing out residual integration issues and completing our decommissioning process i am very confident in truists trajectory and reaffirm our commitment to delivering positive operating leverage for the full year of i am going to share some more details on those topics in a moment going to slide as you all know truist is fundamentally a deep purpose led company dedicated to inspire and build better lives and communities we know that our purpose driven culture is the foundation for our success as a company our purpose drives performance and defines how we do business every day it very intentionally begins with the word inspire and to be inspirational its often necessary to be bold and to be first ill highlight four examples that i think reflect that purpose on the next slide first and foremost weve recently announced that were making a significant investment in our teammates by raising our minimum wage to an hour effective october 1st this increase will benefit approximately teammates about of whom will have client facing roles in our retail and small business banking business purposeful growth is dependent on attracting and retaining the best talent in addition to our industryleading benefits we designed our compensation program that also helps teammates who need it most to blunt the impact of inflation in their daily lives second we had a historic launch of truist one banking yesterday this is our new differentiated suite of checking solutions that reimagine everyday banking including two new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit the flagship truist one checking account has zero overdraft fees and the capability to provide qualifying clients the liquidity they need through a simple negative balance buffer we also introduced the truist confidence account which provides consumers with access to mainstream banking services and no overdraft fees were mindful of the impacts that inflation and reduced stimulus may have on some of our clients and truist one is one of many examples of how were advancing financial inclusion across our communities truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 third truist committed million to strengthen and support diverse and small businesses this commitment exemplifies our purpose by supporting small businesses which are so vital to the health and vibrancy of our communities and fourth we released our esg and csr report in early june at truist we view all the elements of esg as an opportunity to improve our company and to put our purpose into action and that includes climate change as we look to externalize our own net zero aspirations and further the transition to a lower carbon economy weve recently created new advisory practices within our cib and commercial community bank to help our clients make their own transition were pleased with how our clients have welcomed and embraced our advice and expertise around esg as it underscores the possibilities in viewing esg as an opportunity for growth now turning to slide consistent with our previous guidance mergerrelated costs totaled million roughly half of what they were in the first quarter we expect merger costs to decrease significantly in the back half of before going away entirely in this trajectory should be welcome news to shareholders as diminishing merger costs correspond to a less complex narrative improving earnings quality more capital and ultimately industryleading returns lastly we incurred a million pretax gain related to the early extinguishment of million an fhlb debt turning to our second quarter performance highlights on the next slide we earned billion or a share on a reported basis excluding the selected items on slide adjusted earnings totaled billion or a share down compared to a year ago primarily due to a sizable reserve release in the prior quarter relative to the first quarter adjusted eps decreased as higher loan loss provision offset a increase in adjusted ppnr adjusted revenue benefited from higher shortterm rates alongside wellcontrolled deposit costs strong loan growth consumer seasonality and strong insurance results partially offset by continued softness in market sensitive fee businesses such as investment banking wealth and mortgage adjusted rotce was up from in the prior three quarters even when normalizing things like aoci to zero and assuming a flat alll ratio adjusted rotce was a strong adjusted expenses increased reflecting higher insurance related incentive compensation and intentional investments in talent and technology to support our shift from integrating to operating other expenses also increased due to normalization of teammate travel and elevated operational losses we have planned products processes and technology enhancements underway to reduce these losses and enhance the overall client experience including the launch of innovative authentication approaches later this quarter while operating leverage was a negative basis points yeartodate this primarily reflects the million yeartodate headwind we have from ppp and paa revenue despite these headwinds were still targeting positive operating leverage on both a gaap and adjusted basis for the full year asset quality remains excellent and net chargeoffs decreased relative to the first quarter capital deployment was healthy in the second quarter as we funded strong loan growth and completed million worth of share repurchases capital levels remain strong in light of our risk and profitability profile demonstrated by our continued strong performance in the ccar process overall the second quarter begins to reflect the power of truist post integration now turning to slide digital activity increased in the second quarter attributable to seasonality and nearly enhancements we implemented across the platform representing a significantly higher pace of the value delivery truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 for our clients our ability to rapidly incorporate client feedback reflects the capabilities of a more modern and agile digital platform and has resulted in improved client satisfaction scores which have risen consistently since our initial introduction of truist digital in waves in in june we announced the grand opening of our stateoftheart innovation and technology center located within our headquarters the itc provides an environment conducive to reimagining the client experience such as by facilitating new ways of working with agile teams to better collaborate with clients to cocreate dynamic and marketable crosschannel services the new space features client journey rooms a maker space for building testing and refining new products and services a reality lab where we can utilize virtual and augmented reality technology and a contact center incubator where we can collect and respond to realtime feedback directly from our clients im personally excited about our improved ability to aid our teammates as they reimagine how we serve clients we also acquired san franciscobased long game the awardwinning gamification app that utilizes behavioral economics prizelinked savings and mobile gaming to motivate positive financial behaviors and drive new account growth and client retention by leveraging long games innovative technology truist can empower our clients to build longterm financial wellness im also pleased to report that our merger integration activities are now complete our final merger release was rolled out in may and we recently held our last merger oversight committee meeting as we shift to bau our digital and technology teams are looking forward to accelerating our pace of innovation and client experience improvements yesterday as i mentioned we introduced truist one and as i referenced earlier well soon expand lightstream to include a new deposit product on a realtime cloudbased core enhance the sophistication of our underwriting models through a partnership with zest rollout truist assist our virtual assistant to millions of clients just to name a few examples overall were increasingly optimistic about the performance and the potential of our increased investments and focus on digital and technology now turning to loans and leases on slide average loan balances increased a very robust billion or sequentially with growth across most businesses the pace of growth accelerated during the quarter with end of period loans up growth was primarily driven by ci where average balances increased billion or overall we delivered broadbased loan growth across most cib industry verticals notably energy consumer and retail financial institutions tmt due to ma activity the current shift to banks from the bond market increased relevance with new and existing clients and a higher revolver usage for capex inventories and inflation as in recent quarters growth continues to be strong within our asset finance group as we continue to build out that business with more talent product capabilities and a larger balance sheet commercial community bank ci balances increased excluding ppp and dealer floor plan reflecting growth across all our geographic regions and was the second strongest end of period growth since revolver utilization increased basis points to just over the highest level since mid2020 cre remains a headwind reflecting both the highly competitive market and our disciplined approach at the same time though i continue to be optimistic about the future of our cre business as we create more strategic clarity internally and nonbank competition rationalizes somewhat with rising rates truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 wealth lending was up million sequentially as our advisors and clients continue to benefit from the combined capabilities of both heritage firms residential mortgage increased reflecting ongoing correspondent purchases and slower prepayments fees excluding mortgage consumer and card balances increased billion or as strong growth in service finance prime auto sheffield and lightstream more than offset runoff in our partnership and student portfolios service finance is performing in line with our high expectations and experiencing good business ph developed momentum given the alignment with truist second quarter production by service finance was about double the volume loss and double the profitability from our terminated partnerships our prime auto business is also back on its front foot after regaining some momentum it lost following its own fourth quarter conversion in addition our consumer finance businesses continue to advance their automated decision capabilities which ultimately improves consistency efficiency and creates better client experiences overall clients are generally positive on current economic conditions and demand in their businesses at the same time concerns about labor shortages and margin pressure given rising rates and higher input costs are growing creating the potential for more defensive postures truist is well positioned to advise clients across a range of scenarios given our broad capabilities and talented teammates given all of this we remain generally positive about our prospects for continued loan growth particularly taking into account our postintegration momentum at the same time we have to acknowledge the increased uncertainty associated with the softening economic environment which may cause loan growth to deviate from this outlook turning to deposits on slide average deposit balances increased billion or during the second quarter largely attributable to an increase in brokered deposits in midmarch excluding brokered deposits average deposits decreased billion or deposit costs were very well controlled reflecting truists strong retail and commercialoriented franchise and our enviable market share position in addition our lines of business and corporate treasury teams delivered excellent execution against a thoughtful strategy to be attentive to client needs and client relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid as a result interest bearing client deposit betas were well below our modeled assumptions as the interest rate environment evolves well continue to take a balanced approach to managing deposit growth and rate paid particularly given our broad access to other forms of funding and now let me turn it over to daryl to review our financial performance in greater detail daryl n bible chief financial officer truist financial corp good morning everyone turning to slide net interest income increased sequentially driven by higher shortterm interest rates alongside limited deposit betas in addition to strong loan growth we also saw a positive asset mix shift with the investment portfolio shrinking and funding strong loan growth as bill indicated the strong quality of our deposit franchise also limited deposit rate repricing reported net interest margin increased basis points and core net interest margin increased basis points net interest margin and net interest income increased for similar reasons and exceeded the high end of our april guidance primarily due to our teammates delivering lower than modeled deposit betas overall we continue to take a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 we continue to be asset sensitive and that will decrease over time with the diminishing benefit associated with future rate increases and the disintermediation of funding sources we forecasted an approximate cumulative interest bearing deposit beta through the second and third quarters to protect against any potential downside in rates we also added billion of swaps which are primarily forward starting these swaps begin in and and will have laddered maturities that range from three to five years to minimize earnings volatility moving to slide fee income increased million or sequentially insurance income increased million due to the seasonality strong organic growth and the full quarter of kensington vanguard acquisition card and payment related fees increased million reflecting the prior quarter acquisition of merchant relationships and the increased activity residential mortgage income decreased million or as higher interest rates pressured volumes and gain on sale margins servicing income was essentially flat from the prior quarter as lower prepays were offset by increasing hedging costs while this is a very challenging environment for mortgage our mortgage team is playing some offense by leveraging truists strong purpose and balance sheet to hire select wellregarded loan officers as well as acquire certain servicing portfolios investment banking and trading income was relatively flat sequentially and declined yearoveryear as market volatility continues to negatively impact most products investment banking pipelines remain full across all products but the realization of these pipelines will continue to remain subject to more stable market conditions service charges on deposits were relatively flat sequentially as favorable seasonal trends were offset by the elimination of certain overdraft fees in april resulting in client savings of approximately million during the quarter we included a table at the bottom of slide to make other income trends more clear other income excluding changes in our nonqualified plan and last quarters merchant gain decreased million primarily due to a loss on a certain sale of sbic funds to diversify our private equity investment portfolio turning to slide reported expenses decreased million sequentially to billion the lower expenses were driven by million or reduction in merger costs due to diminishing integration activity adjusted expenses increased million personnel expenses increased million due to seasonally higher insurance related incentive compensation the full impact of normal first quarter compensation increases and ongoing investments in talent across our lines of business and technology teams in addition other expense increased million due to higher operational losses and ongoing normalization of teammate travel professional fees and outside processing costs increased million primarily due to the increase in call center staffing as bill mentioned our minimum wage will increase to per hour effective october this represents a significant investment in our teammates and is expected to increase our personnel expense by million annually offset by lower turnover expense and improved execution and client experience moving to slide asset quality remains excellent reflecting our prudent risk culture diverse portfolio and solid economic conditions leading credit indicators remain benign criticized and classified commercial loans decreased sequentially and are lower to a year ago our npl ratio was flat at basis points and loans to days past due decreased basis points to basis points our net chargeoff ratio also decreased basis points to basis points truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 we experienced a slight build in the allowance due to loan growth although the allowance coverage ratio decreased basis points to basis points given our strong portfolio performance tempered somewhat by our moderately slower economic outlook while the weighting of our pessimistic baseline and optimistic scenarios were unchanged from the first quarter each scenario is moderately worse a trend that may continue moving on slide our cet1 ratio declined basis points to audio gap strong loan growth and a million share repurchase during the second quarter as previously announced our board will consider an increase in the quarterly common dividend at its july meeting if approved the increase will take effect in the third quarter and will continue to position truist as one of the dividend leaders in our peer group we were also pleased with the performance during the stress test truist had the second lowest cet1 erosion and a loan loss reserve rate in the peer group under severely adverse scenario our preliminary stress test capital buffer remained flat at basis points we believe these results demonstrate our strong capital relative to the risk and profitability profile the latter of which should improve over time we are now more comfortable operating below our previously announced cet1 ratio target of given our continued strong stress test results and significantly reduced integration risk overall the economic outlook will influence how much we operate below the prior target from a funding perspective end of period loan growth exceeded deposit growth truist has multiple sources available to fund incremental loan growth as seen this quarter with use of brokered deposits and federal home loan bank advances and our securities portfolio i will now provide guidance for full year and new guidance for the third quarter in we now expect adjusted revenue to grow to from the mixture of revenue continues to tilt more towards net interest income given the outlook for higher shortterm interest rates partially offset by lower fees primarily in market sensitive businesses such as investment banking mortgage and wealth we now expect adjusted noninterest expense to increase to from this increase in expense outlook largely reflects higher operating losses and intentional investments to support our shift from integrating to operating including increasing our minimum wage hiring teammates to support client experience and growth and ongoing investments in technology netnet this is slightly higher ppnr outlook versus our previously full year guide in light of our performance during the first half of the year and the benign credit environment we expect net chargeoff ratio to be in the to basis points for the full year looking into the third quarter we expect adjusted ppnr to grow highsingledigits in the second quarter level primarily as a result of higher net interest income partially offset by higher noninterest expense we expect mid20 basis point increase in our core net interest margin due to the benefits from recent rate hikes and a projected basis point hike in july we also expect low basis point increase in gaap net interest margin as a result of core net interest margin expansion offset by continued declines in purchase accounting accretion now ill turn it back to bill to conclude william henry rogers jr chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 thanks daryl and moving to slide on our previous earnings call in april i expressed my belief that the first quarter marked a strategic and financial turning point for truist our second quarter results are bearing out this thesis and were beginning to deliver on the potential of truist for businesses that finished conversions in the increased momentum is palpable wealth continues to build momentum in hiring advisors who are attracted to truists purpose and broad set of capabilities both within wealth and across the company through irm wealth net advisor count grew in the second quarter for the first time in quarters with our recent entry into the chicago market truist wealth now serves of the largest metropolitan areas in the united states in addition net organic asset flows have been positive for five straight quarters in our mortgage business client satisfaction scores for origination have improved every month since their conversion in august of the percentage of retail client applications completed digitally is now for the rest of the company where core bank conversions were completed in the first quarter of momentum is also building loan production in the second quarter was the highest its been at truist and up compared to the first quarter pipelines also ended the quarter at the highest weve seen branch loan production which is primarily home equity was up relative to the first quarter and the highest its been at truist consumer deposit production both in the branches and within digital was up sequentially and yearoveryear retail banking net promoter and client satisfaction scores have rebounded nicely from their march lows and we still have more opportunity to improve deposit production within our commercial community bank is up relative to the first quarter ph tcb related irm revenue was up sequentially with increased activity across all products with significant momentum highlighting the power of our advicedriven model financially net interest income and margin rebounded from the first quarter low point as expected while fee income did not improve to the extent we had hoped our second quarter results underscore the importance of our diverse business mix and we believe fees will improve as market conditions normalize and we capitalize on our significant irm and revenue synergy opportunities in addition merger costs are declining rapidly and were making good progress towards realizing our remaining cost saves as we decommission data centers and systems in the back half of the year all of which will help drive positive operating leverage for the full year so to conclude on slide truist is on the right path and im highly optimistic about our potential all of which is clearly summarized in our investment thesis strategically our focus has clearly shifted to executional excellence transformation and growth were shifting millions of hours of integration related activity to improving our client experience through investments in digital and technology simplification of our processes and operations and of course by continuing to activate our purpose each and every day were also focused on capturing the significant irm and revenue synergy potential we have as this is squarely in the center of building better lives for our clients these shifts and activities do not require incremental risk appetite or capital it only requires execution and focus at the same time while we believe the economy is currently healthy the effects of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty coupled with still too high inflation and an aggressive forecast for tightening the monetary policy have somewhat diminished the economic outlook as we move further into this year and into next truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 truist is nevertheless well positioned across a broad range of economic outcomes given our advice oriented model for clients strong absolute and relative markets conservative credit culture diverse business mix a strong capital position relative to our risk profile and most importantly our power shift from a focus on integration to executional excellence and growth and with that let me turn it back over to you ankur ankur vyas executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp thanks bill jennifer at this time will you please explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session as you do that id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one followup so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well go first to betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc a couple of questions just on how youre thinking about the funding mix i know you had several comments in your prepared remarks around accessing some of the pools you have could you talk a little bit about what youre doing with deposit pricing for your core deposits how youre thinking about utilizing brokered from here and then if you could speak a little bit about the hedge that you put on for protecting earnings against future volatility and where we should expect that to show up in the nim and how thats going to factor into your outlook for your rate sensitivity thanks daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah betsy so i would first start with we were really excited to have really strong broadbased loan growth this quarter and we expect that to continue as bill said in his prepared remarks to fund that were going to start with the runoff of our investment portfolio we built the investment portfolio when we had all that excess liquidity were very comfortable letting that runoff and have a positive mix change on the balance sheet truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 as far as brokered deposits we did add some brokered deposits over the last several months i would say were probably at where we want to be from that perspective knowing that we still have a lot of capacity and other funding sources available in the marketplace you look at federal home loan bank advances and negotiable cds and other amounts we paid all that off during covid in and we have much amount of capacity there the other thing from an investment portfolio perspective were about billion give or take and we feel comfortable we could shrink that portfolio probably billion to billion easily and still stay within our liquidity and lcr guidelines that we have to for regulatory purposes though as far as our strategies for pricing we were really pleased as bill talked about across our company our deposit betas came in much better than modeled we modeled for the first basis points if you look in the second quarter we came at and that includes brokered when you back out the brokered we were only at which is really really low i would say we will continue to use that strategy were going to make sure that we take care of our clients and use the ability to do exception pricing but i think overall i think we will continue to hopefully continue to outperform our model expectations william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp betsy one thing id add is that indiscernible i think well be somewhat stable for deposits for the balance of the year but remember as daryl pointed out we had just under growth in dda so i mean were adding net new clients and expanding those relationships and i think the beta really just reflects the benefits of the merger were sitting now with just under market share in most of our markets weve got a business thats highly diversified somewhere around 40pluspercent of our deposits are less than so weve got a unique franchise here which i think on the dda side continues to benefit and overall stable deposits for the balance of the year daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp ph sorry betsy i didnt answer betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and the loan growth daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp your hedge question william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah ph please go ahead daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 we are just gradually starting to add some receivers out in the forward markets for the most part out one to two years since we are ph stingy on the way up on deposit rates you wont have as much capacity on the way down so were just putting in these forward hedges and protect net interest income as rates might potentially fall overall but we still are asset sensitive ph though decreasing as rates continue to go up betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay no thats helpful and then on your point on loan growth yeah loan growth was very strong and i guess the followup question here is what are you hearing from the field with regard to the pace of that loan growth is it poised to accelerate continue at this pace for the foreseeable future just a little bit of a sensing color for how we should be thinking about that thanks so much william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah betsy and thats the question of longterm sustainability but on the shortterm basis and through the balance of this year if we sort of look on a yearoveryear basis we were sort of in the midsingle figures i think well be in the higher end of the single figures in terms of loan growth our teams are excited our production numbers which i highlighted are up significantly our pipelines are up so i think were seeing a little bit of maybe idiosyncratic to us and our shift to integration in terms of prowess on the loan side and the great news is that it is extremely broadbased so not only is it in the ci side but our core branch network i mean their applications are up personal loans are up helocs are up so similarly theyre starting to execute at a much higher level betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator well go next to ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yes good morning sorry about that yeah as a followup on the fee side youve had great insurance revenue this quarter up we heard your comments about some of the challenges looking out on some of the other lines so can you just kind of help us walk through just what youre expecting on the fee income side inside that third quarter ppnr outlook that you gave because i think you talked mostly just about higher nii and higher expenses so can you any granularity on the fee side would be great thank you william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah hey ken let me maybe just do a walkthrough of the broad categories and i think sort of overall id say fee income stable relative to the first half and maybe let me give you some puts and takes against that insurance as you noted solid organic growth thatll offset some of that seasonality so feel really good about the momentum that we have there and as we mentioned earlier were continuing to invest in the insurance business so feel good about the growth there truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 mortgage some puts and takes origination probably a little bit offset by servicing gain of sales probably a little bit of a wildcard there in terms of whether we see some rebound on that side as some of the capacity comes out but mortgage probably a little flat second half of the year to the first half of the year wealth probably be a little bit down in the third quarter just sort of where markets are right now but as i highlighted earlier our really solid production and asset flows and hiring net advisors so if we get a little market tailwind that could change investment banking i think we expect the second half to be better than the first pipelines continue to be really solid and then weve got a bit of things that are unique to us weve got this really good irm momentum from our commercial community bank thats probably a little bit less market dependent id sort of call that more sort of bread and butter kind of investment banking business and then weve added bankers there also and were continuing to invest so were leaning in there and then on the service charge side with the decisions weve made with truist one and overdraft decisions that will be down so sort of netnet thats i think a good walk through on the fee income side ken usdin q analyst jefferies company great okay and then second question just on you had talked about operating lower cet1 than your we saw a this quarter and just what youre thinking we saw you did a little buyback and just in terms of capital allocation decisions and potential for more of those insurance deals that you guys have been biased towards over time thanks bill william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah so i mean the really great news is were using capital exactly where we want to right now so were using it with growth so weve been funding the loan growth as weve talked about our capital levels were driven by merger risk ccar results and economic uncertainty i think merger risk is largely behind us very pleased with the ccar results our low risk profile better ppnr profile economic uncertainty was really high during the pandemic moderated and maybe increasing a little bit so weve got to balance all of those but were comfortable where we are weve had more organic growth we do see more opportunity in some of the nonbank ma as you noted so were going to allow capacity and be opportunistic there as well and then we generate post merger well generate somewhere around basis points of capital a quarter organically if you sort of say okay well use about basis points of that to fund the current growth that we have and anticipate then weve got about basis points net so i think that gives us the requisite flexibility to fund the growth that we anticipate be flexible as you noted for potential nonbank ma particularly on the insurance side and so if you add all that share repurchase probably is not our top priority at this particular juncture ken usdin q analyst jefferies company thanks ph and all that bill william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp all right sure truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 operator well go next to gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning bill good morning daryl william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp morning daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bill can you share with us you obviously put together a very good quarter this quarter and you put some very strong numbers in your comments at the very end of the prepared remarks about growth but then youve cautioned it of course with whats going on at the macro ph scene with monetary policy and such can you share with us what youre seeing from your customers because there seems to be a disconnect a lot of investors are very concerned about credit deterioration you certainly dont see it nor do your peers but is there something on the horizon other than the macro that you guys are seeing or what are your early indicators youre looking at to see if there will be a crack in credit maybe in or months william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean sort of going down the categories of that question our clients still see a lot of good demand i may be a little bit clouded by the fact the last two markets i was in were south florida and nashville and theres they are blowing and going in virtually every direction but our clients continue to see good demand i think its appropriate to put a cautious note just because i think you have to and if we look at sort of what are the canaries in the coal mine so to speak what are the things that were trying to look at and while we dont see a deterioration i think the things you look at are things like whats happening in the broadly syndicated sponsorbacked leverage deals so we sort of look at that market spreads gapped out pretty significantly things happening in cre weve seen some nonrecourse construction loans and some things that you sort of pause a little bit on some potential fico drift and willingness to repay given some of the stimulus will things happen in mortgage as some of the care act relief comes off now all those things that are there were not seeing in our results right now but they are things that were looking at and that were stressing and trying to pay attention to so i think just were bankers so we should be conservative thats the world we live in and we try to manage for all outcomes but sitting here today looking at the hood of the car demand looks pretty good and our business looks pretty good and our clients are extremely healthy truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no thats very good thank you and then as a followup daryl you mentioned the deposit beta came in better than expected i think you said without the brokered deposits it came in around basis points i think you guys were modeling for something closer to basis points can you share with us what drove the better than expected number and second as the fed goes another basis points assuming they do in july and then obviously further rate increases later this year could the modeling work against you meaning could the betas actually go faster later in the year because rates are moving up so quickly daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah so gerard i would just tell you that i think it was a lot of great work with our teammates working with clients and giving what we thought was appropriate most of our clients arent there just for rate because we have other products and services they really like to bank with us for those reasons so they arent as rate sensitive as other clients might be in other places so i think thats really the benefit of our franchise i do agree with you though as interest rates go up our deposit betas will continue to climb just because more and more people will get a little bit more asset sensitive in the prepared remarks i did say that our cumulative beta would move from to in the second to third quarter on a cumulative basis we would still expect it to go on if the fed continues to raise interest rates that you continue to see ph that cumulative beta increasing and probably if you look at from second quarter to fourth quarter we may be in the low give or take couple of percentage points there so overall if you go back to where we were during the great recession much better overall performance than what we had a few of our banks were combined back then so i think right now i think we feel very good and i think that youre going to see really positive growth in our net interest income because of that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you gentlemen and appreciate it operator well go next to matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp hi matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i just want to follow up on the expense guide obviously overall the ppnr guide is higher but the expenses have been an area of focus i think for the company since the merger and i did just want to kind of follow up on truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 whats driving the tweak up by roughly on expenses especially since the fees are coming in a little bit weaker and net interest income tends not to have a lot of fees or a lot of expenses related to it and then just as we think about the follow up would be confidence that you can control expenses kind of next year without the benefit of this kind of merger and other merger related costs that will be done this year william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah matt this is bill no eye off the ball on expenses i can assure you that so the competencies that weve built through the merger to manage expenses understand expenses create continued improvements are all still there and will be a big part of our expense story for this year and for the years going forward and a big part of our capability to deliver positive operating leverage and i think industry leading efficiency ratio so no lack of focus on the expense side and we have lots of things underway in terms of how we would achieve those additional opportunities but on the same side were going to were investing in our business and just like weve seen some of this momentum weve talked about particularly coming from the first quarter into this quarter we dont want to miss those opportunities and those opportunities dont line up quartertoquarter i think they line up well we have confidence in the investments weve made in talent and insurance wealth investment banking care centers as an example improved revenue potential improved the client experience and we have a pretty good formula for longterm paybacks on those investments i mean weve been at this and have a pretty good understanding of that also the investments in our teammates for the minimum wage so that was thats a clear step up i think in fairness that over time others will be in that same position but we just felt like as i mentioned earlier it was important for us to lead this is a time when those teammates need us most i think it will really help us long term in terms of retention and acquisition of key talent so it also has immediate bump up and a longerterm payback which i feel really good about and then the one thats just trickier and a little more quarter and yearend specific is just the increase in operating losses and they are up theyre up higher than we think they should be we have a lot of things in place to do that we made some decisions related to the client experience that i think increased some of those operating losses but im confident that theyll normalize over time given the investments were making in that part but thats the only part that i would say is the noninvestment part of the increase in the expense side and i think well be more positive about that long term and normalizing those expenses matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and what exactly are those operating losses maybe you can give an example or two and is any of that related to the deal conversion and any followup from that to be blunt thank you william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean there are decisions we made relative to client experience ill give you an example of on the fraud side is giving the client the benefit of the doubt upfront so if a client has an experience were going to get the money back from another bank and what were doing is go ahead and funding that client now that has a one truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 time increase but over time that normalizes just as an example and we think thats a good client experience and something again that will normalize over time its just one example daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp matt you also asked for containment of expenses on a go forward basis as we look to rationalize and get back to business as usual i think theres still opportunities in our corporate real estate portfolio i think as we continue to rationalize our branch network closure of some branches over time just as behaviors change with our clients i think weve talked about this before but we still have a lot of initiatives that our teammates came up with that would help us from both the cost savings as well as revenue and client experience perspective and were in the midst of implementing those over the next to months we also are moving towards a new card platform over the next year or two which would generate some savings once we both combine to that from a technology perspective we are starting to put more applications up into the cloud which over time were also generating some savings and last thing i just want to mention is as you look at our operations both front and back office the digitization and artificial intelligence projects that are rolling out all part and very important to how the company runs and operates it gives us comfort that our expenses will be contained over the next year or two matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator audio gap go next to mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well bill you gave me the opening you talked about the hood of the car so ill go with the corvette analogy again and william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp all right mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah it looks like on the positive is it looks like youre going from first to second gear right you said end of period loans were up thats accelerating youre beating on deposit beta your nims up you expect it to be up maybe in the range of basis points next quarter nii is going higher and you still have the decommissioning of the data centers and all the apps later this year so that should help so next second gear fantastic but then i look at the speed that youre going and it doesnt seem to be a lot faster yeah ppnr guidance a little bit higher but youre guiding for basis points plus operating leverage for this year if you took the narrow part of your bands and some of your peers are basis points i think last quarter that difference was basis points so in a way the operating leverage is a little bit less than i think what you were guiding in the first quarter truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 and i hear you youre not taking your eye off the ball on expenses youre investing in minimum wage you have some operating losses but still it just seems like the power of the corvette is still not being fully realized so where are you in that progression of translating the power of the engine to the power of the growth and the power of the operating leverage because your efficiency ratios not really in the zip code of the initial figures you gave when you announced the merger three and a half years ago thank you william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp couple things mike so i appreciate the acknowledgment of second gear at least so i dont know how many gears your corvette has but at least theres an acknowledgment of the second gear and i think we are seeing that we are seeing that growth and i feel really good about the migration from the first to the second quarter if loan growth is one of those indicators but i dont think its always the indicator but if i look at production and pipelines and just the things that were doing and its broadbased so its not one thing its the whole engine operating at a faster pace but if were going to continue to just grind on the corvette thing you got to put gas in it and you got to put and gas is more expensive we want to drive it faster and were really confident in the things that were investing in and the capability of the company long term as it relates to the efficiency ratio from the first guidance i mean remember that was in an interest rate environment that was pretty different than where we are now i still believe and were delivering and prospectively well deliver industry leading efficiency ratio with growth whether its at or low i dont know but i am confident that it will be industry leading in any different in any rate environment so i feel good about that so and then weve got market sensitive businesses that are sitting on the launching pad and really good capability to grow significantly if we get a little bit of tailwind and that tailwind could come in the fourth quarter it could come next year but its going to come and were better positioned than weve ever been to capitalize on those opportunities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess what my question is getting to perhaps some of the other questions and i know im not going to get an answer but you can give it qualitatively looking out to when you finally have all the merger savings in your numbers and when you finally have realized some of the noisy financial items such as the operating losses and you finally are done with these oneoff charges which are going down what sort of operating leverage we can expect next year at least if you can answer that qualitatively or if you want to put numbers around it wed love it william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah qualitatively its got to be qualitatively because we just dont know what the rate environments going to be so qualitatively it will be positive thats the angle that were gaining towards and committed to but similarly and i think again youre seeing it this quarter with revenue growth that reflects the power of this franchise and an efficient expense model that supports that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 all right thank you operator well go next to erika najarian with ubs erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc yes hi i just to followup on the corvette analogy you are driving this car and in theory the roads are getting worse right so maybe the first question i have is in the last crisis both companies did fairly well relatively well from a credit perspective and daryl as you think about the different scenarios for acl buildup in a downturn a lot of investors are comfortable thinking about where the banking industry could be in a chargeoffs scenario but none of us can mimic the cecl process right so i guess the question is in a mild recession scenario how much more acl build do you think would be ahead of you for what the chargeoffs that you think your portfolio would produce daryl n bible a chief financial officer truist financial corp hey erika ill start and clarke can help finish me off on this but when we set the ph allowance obviously its scenariobased its always forwardlooking from that perspective in the prepared remarks we did say that there is potential that the scenarios can continue to deteriorate if that is the case then you would expect us to continue to add to our allowance and that would add to our ph provision costs as that moves up from that perspective but right now we arent seeing a whole lot and there could be some deterioration from that perspective but let me kick it back over to clarke clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp yeah erika i would just say this and bill mentioned it and daryl earlier as we came through the quarter we refreshed all of our scenarios so our baseline which is of our estimate is a more pessimistic outlook slower economy and then we have a weight on a recessionary or more pessimistic scenarios so we feel like weve been pretty conservative in our estimate this quarter and also this quarter we had really good loan growth and very highly rated credits so those carry a lower relative reserve rate so thats why you didnt see a big build this quarter you saw basis points decline in our allowance that was because of the growth so we believe weve accounted for some of the recessionary risk right now and so as we look forward the main driver of changing the allowance would be growth unless the scenarios get more severe and then obviously our reserve rate would have to change erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you for taking my question ankur vyas a executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp jennifer weve got time for one more question truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022 operator well take our last question from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning just on the also on the credit front can you just talk about are you seeing any emerging signs of stress within the portfolio particularly as you look at some of the lowerend consumer maybe in your regional acceptance business on the nonprime side or the sheffield business if you can just talk about where if any that youre seeing some of the cracks form thanks clarke r starnes iii a chief risk officer truist financial corp ph clarke i mean we are monitoring that very carefully so i think what were seeing probably a little bit of indication would be the low to moderate income consumer think cohorts incomes and below were seeing higher delinquent early delinquency in those area but has not translated yet into higher latestage delinquencies or losses so for example in our subprime auto business we had one of our lower loss rates this quarter seasonally and were seeing things like because of the manheim being up consumers higher redemption rates even on repo so its not yet translated into any losses weve also looked at our deposit levels or our consumer borrowers and theyre not coming down rapidly particularly for the moderate income and above so while theres early signs were watching its not translated into any significant concerns and our outlook right now for the rest of the year does not assume any significant deterioration john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks clarke and then just separately on the loan growth side i know you indicated that you did see some pressure there this quarter on commercial real estate but you seem a bit more optimistic there in stabilization how should we think about the growth in that portfolio is there the potential for incremental declines there or do you think stabilization will happen beginning next quarter thanks william henry rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah im not sure its quartertoquarter but i think were stabilizing is the way i would say it and into more of a growth mode and by the way we feel really comfortable about it i think weve made decisions through the cycle that create a really good portfolio weve done a lot of things internally strategically to get really really strong alignment around the type of cre portfolio we want the diversity that we want so probably somewhere in the next couple of quarters stabilizing with the bent for growth over time john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks bill ankur vyas executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2022
