market risk management market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market rates or prices including interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices commodity prices or other relevant rates or prices effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truists strategic financial objectives truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists bus interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk other than trading as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities since interest rate changes are out of the control of any private sector institution truist actively manages its interest rate risk with the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities taking into account the volumes maturities and mix with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk i a model that simulates possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on a set of assumptions ii an analysis of interest rate shock scenarios and iii a model that analyzes the economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates the simulation model takes into account assumptions about prepayment trends using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the likely outlook for the economy and interest rates these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in market interest rates as compared to the rates of truists assets and liabilities the model also considers truists current and prospective liquidity position current balance sheet volumes and projected growth accessibility of funds for shortterm needs and capital maintenance deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process truist applies an average deposit beta the difference between rates truist pays and market rates of approximately to its nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts for determining its interest rate sensitivity nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables including noninterestbearing deposits to determine the impact they could have on the interest rate risk position the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions but management believes that it provides helpful data for the management of interest rate risk truist financial corporation the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next twelve months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below the decrease in rate sensitivity versus the prior period is related to the merger alignment of modeling assumptions and recent balance sheet restructuring activities table interest sensitivity simulation analysis interest rate scenario annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income linear change in prime rate bps prime rate dec dec dec dec up up no change down down truist has established parameters related to interest rate sensitivity measures that prescribe a maximum impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios that would result in an escalation to the board the following parameters and interest rate scenarios are considered truists primary measures of interest rate risk maximum impact on net interest income of for the next months assuming a basis point change in interest rates each quarter for four quarters and a maximum impact on net interest income of for an immediate basis point parallel change in rates this interest rate shock analysis is designed to create an outer bound of acceptable interest rate risk truist also uses an eve analysis to focus on longerterm projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates this measure allows truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the simulation model parameters the eve model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets liabilities and derivative instruments the difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as eve the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on eve table eve simulation analysis change in interest rates bps hypothetical percentage change in eve dec dec up no change down truist uses derivatives primarily to manage interest rate risk related to securities commercial loans msrs and mortgage banking operations longterm debt and other funding sources truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients as of december truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling billion with a net fair value of billion see note derivative financial instruments for additional disclosures libor in its current form may no longer be available after truist has liborbased contracts that extend beyond to prepare for the possible transition to an alternative reference rate management has formed a crossfunctional project team to address the libor transition the project team has performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from libor to a new index the project provides regular reports to the board and risk management committees the project team is reviewing contract fallback language for loans and leases and noted that certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition and is coordinating with impacted lines of business to update libor fallback language generally consistent with the arrc recommendation truist is continuing to evaluate the impact on these contracts and other financial instruments systems implications hedging strategies and other related operational and market risks market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions at transition for a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of libor and the transition to alternative reference rates refer to the section titled item risk factors truist financial corporation market risk from trading activities truist also manages market risk associated with trading activities truist is a financial intermediary that provides its clients access to derivatives foreign exchange and securities markets trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach which includes measuring risk using var stress testing and sensitivity analysis risk metrics are monitored against limits on a daily basis at both trading desks and at the aggregate portfolio level to ensure exposures are in line with truists risk appetite truist is subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule issued jointly by the occ us treasury frb and fdic covered trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions subject to the market risk rule results primarily from market making and underwriting services for our clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation policies procedures and methodologies exist for all covered positions additionally trading positions are subject to independent price verification see note derivative financial instruments note fair value disclosures and critical accounting policies herein for discussion of valuation policies procedures and methodologies securitizations as of december the aggregate market value of onbalance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule was million all of which were nonagency asset backed securities positions consistent with the market risk rule requirements the company performs prepurchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including but not limited to deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets that materially affect valuation and performance securitization positions are subject to truists comprehensive risk management framework which includes daily monitoring against a full suite of limits there were no offbalance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of december or varbased measures var measures the estimated potential loss at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions following the merger truist elected to migrate all covered positions to the heritage suntrust var system and methodology for an interim period var for a subset of heritage bbt positions specifically those covered positions held in bbt securities will be calculated using the heritage bbt var system and methodology as such pending full integration truist will operate two historical var models and aggregate companywide var will be determined additively with no benefit of diversification for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing profit and loss attribution and stop loss limits truist financial corporation the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions the following table summarizes certain varbased

varbased measures day holding period year ended december  in millions maximum average minimum periodend specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements eg default event risks the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a modelbased approach subject to regulatory approval truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital and comprehensive risk measure capital requirements do not apply var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model the number of companywide var backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the varbased capital requirement under the market risk rule the capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four depending on the number of exceptions there were two companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended december in accordance with established policy and procedure all companywide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance there was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months truist financial corporation model risk management managements approach to the validation and evaluation of the accuracy of truists models and associated processes includes conceptual soundness developmental and implementation testing as well as outcomes analysis ongoing monitoring and maintenance performed by the various model developers in conjunction with model owners mrm is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models the validation activities are conducted in accordance with mrm standards which includes regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis as part of ongoing monitoring efforts the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets assess evolving modeling approaches and to identify potential model enhancement stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks all trading positions within each applicable market risk category interest rate risk equity risk foreign exchange rate risk credit spread risk and commodity price risk are included in the companys comprehensive stress testing framework management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates as necessary to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately management also utilizes stress analyses to support the companys capital adequacy assessment standards see the capital section of this mda for additional discussion of capital adequacy liquidity liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs including deposit withdrawals timely repayment of borrowings and other liabilities and funding of loan commitments in addition to the level of liquid assets such as cash cash equivalents and afs securities other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs including access to a variety of funding sources maintaining borrowing capacity in national money markets growing core deposits loan repayment and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions in considering its liquidity position management evaluates truists funding mix based on client core funding client ratesensitive funding and national markets funding in addition management evaluates exposure to ratesensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less management also measures liquidity needs against days of stressed cash outflows for truist and truist bank to ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance
