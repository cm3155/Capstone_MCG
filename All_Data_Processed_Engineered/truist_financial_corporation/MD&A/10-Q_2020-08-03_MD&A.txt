particular statutory or regulatory provisions summarized they do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in current laws or regulations and are not intended to be a substitute for the related statues or regulatory provisions stress capital buffer and ccar the frb has adopted a final rule that integrates its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with existing regulatory capital requirements for riskbased capital requirements the stress capital buffer replaces the existing capital conservation buffer which is as of january under the final rule beginning in the ccar cycle truist will be required to calculate a stress capital buffer equal to the greater of i the difference between its starting and minimum projected cet1 capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test plus the sum of the dollar amount of truists planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of riskweighted assets or ii the final rule also makes related changes to the capital planning and stress testing process among other changes the revised capital plan rule eliminates the assumption that truists balance sheet assets would increase over the planning horizon in addition provided that truist is otherwise in compliance with automatic restrictions on distributions under the frbs capital rules truist will no longer be required to seek prior approval to make capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan on june the frb provided truist with a

reviewed the results of the ccar supervisory stress test and noted that the modeled outcomes shown by the frb differ from those calculated by the company truist believes those differences are attributable to the application of purchase accounting associated with the merger purchase accounting adjustments could result in a reduction in provision expense and an increase in preprovision net revenue these differences could result in higher capital ratios than were reflected in the ccar results at the same time the frb took several actions following its stress tests in light of the uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic specifically for the third quarter of the frb will require certain large banking organizations including truist to suspend share repurchases cap dividend

cumulative increase in the allowance for credit losses since adoption of cecl following the first two years the electing organization will phase out the aggregate capital effects over the next three

under the section titled risk management truist financial corporation market risk management market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices including interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truists strategic financial objectives truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists bus interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options inherently embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk other than trading as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities since interest rate changes are out of the control of any private sector institution truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities taking into account the volumes maturities and mix with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk i simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates ii analysis of interest rate shock scenarios and iii analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates the companys simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truists assets and liabilities the model also considers truists current and prospective liquidity position current balance sheet volumes and projected growth andor contractions accessibility of funds for shortterm needs and capital maintenance deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process truist applies an average deposit beta the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes of approximately to its nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts for determining its interest rate sensitivity nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables including noninterestbearing deposits to determine the impact they could have on the companys interest rate risk position the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below table interest

down the down and rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect down and basis points for all rate indices rate sensitivity increased compared to the prior periods primarily driven by loan and deposit mix changes related to the merger and recent activity increased fixed rate funding and increased noninterestbearing deposits truist financial corporation truist also uses an eve analysis to focus on longerterm projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates this measure allows truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the net interest income simulation period the eve model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets liabilities and derivative instruments the difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as eve the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on eve table eve simulation analysis change in interest

msrs and mortgage banking operations longterm debt and other funding sources truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities as of june truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling billion with an associated net fair value of billion see note derivative financial instruments for additional disclosures libor in its current form may no longer be available after truist has liborbased contracts that extend beyond to prepare for the possible transition to an alternative reference rate management has formed a crossfunctional project team to address the libor transition the project team has performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from libor to a new index the project team provides regular reports to the board the project team is reviewing contract fallback language for loans and leases and noted that certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition and the team is coordinating with impacted lines of business to update libor fallback language generally consistent with the arrc recommendation truist is continuing to evaluate the impact on these contracts and other financial instruments systems implications hedging strategies and other related operational and market risks

activities as a financial intermediary truist provides its clients access to derivatives foreign exchange and securities markets which generate market risks trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach which includes measuring risk using var stress testing and sensitivity analysis risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level to ensure exposures are in line with truists risk appetite truist is subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities specifically those held for the purpose of shortterm resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected shortterm price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits truists trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for our clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker across different asset classes truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange loan trading and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation policies procedures and

that materially affect valuation and performance securitization positions are subject to truists comprehensive risk management framework which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits there were no offbalance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of june varbased measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions following the merger truist elected to migrate all covered positions to the heritage suntrust var system and methodology for an interim period however var for a subset of heritage bbt positions specifically those covered positions held in bbt securities will be calculated using the heritage bbt var system and methodology as such pending full integration truist will operate two historical var models and aggregate companywide var across the systems will be determined additively with no benefit of diversification for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing profit and loss attribution and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of risk from each of the individual subportfolios as such risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories thereby creating portfolio diversification benefit the following table summarizes certain varbased measures for both the three and six months ended june and the increase from the prior year was mainly due to the integration of the heritage suntrust trading business and the market volatility due to the covid19 pandemic as illustrated in the table below the

other than broad market movements eg default event risks the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a modelbased approach subject to regulatory approval truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital requirements do not apply var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model there were nine companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended june primarily driven by the covid19 pandemic which led to a sudden and significant repricing of financial markets amid an increase in market volatility and deterioration in overall market liquidity in accordance with established policy and procedure all companywide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance following such reviews it was determined that the var model performed in line with expectations however the extreme moves in underlying market risk factors caused by the covid19 pandemic would not typically have been captured within the 1day var measure truist financial corporation model risk management mrm is responsible for the independent model validation of all

emerging developments in financial markets assess evolving modeling approaches and to identify potential model enhancement stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme but

are to provide adequate capital to support truists risk profile consistent with the boardapproved risk appetite provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs comply with relevant laws regulations and supervisory guidance achieve optimal credit ratings for truist and its subsidiaries and provide a competitive return to shareholders riskbased capital ratios which

regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the companys capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators management regularly monitors the capital position of truist on both a consolidated and banklevel basis in this regard managements overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital targets which are above the regulatory well capitalized minimums management has implemented stressed capital ratio minimum targets to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above minimums specified by the frb for the annual ccar process breaches of stressed minimum targets prompt a review of the planned capital actions

guidance and other strategic factors truists goal is to maintain capital levels above all regulatory minimums the current capital conservation buffer of basis points will be replaced by the stress capital buffer effective october during the first quarter of as market conditions evolved truist received board approval to establish new interim operating targets that provide for sufficient capital levels while allowing the company to support clients through the economic downturn these interim operating targets will be evaluated as economic conditions evolve while nonrecurring events or management decisions may result in the company temporarily falling below its operating minimum guidelines for one or more of these ratios it is managements intent to return to these targeted operating minimums within a reasonable period of time through capital planning such temporary decreases below the operating minimums shown above are not considered an infringement of truists overall capital policy provided a return above the minimums is forecasted to occur within a reasonable time period in june the federal reserve informed truist of its preliminary scb of basis points for riskbased capital ratios this buffer which is determined based on stress testing results developed by the federal reserve is basis points above the existing capital conservation buffer the federal reserve will provide truist its final scb by august the scb will be effective from october through september at which point a revised scb will be calculated and provided to truist consistent with the federal reserves mandate across the industry truist will be required to update and resubmit its capital plan later this year to reflect changes in financial markets and the macroeconomic outlook truist has reviewed the results of the ccar supervisory stress test and noted that the modeled outcomes shown by the frb differ from those calculated by the company truist believes those differences are attributable to the application of purchase accounting associated with the merger purchase accounting adjustments could result in a reduction in provision expense and an increase in preprovision net revenue these differences could result in higher capital ratios than were reflected in the ccar results truist financial corporation truists capital ratios are presented in the following table table

accounting pronouncements are included in the note basis of presentation included herein except for the items noted below there have been no changes to the significant accounting policies during intangible assets the severe economic disruption and related financial effects of the covid19 pandemic have impacted truists businesses truists commercial clients have experienced varying levels of disruptions to business activity supply chains and demand for products and services additionally many consumer clients have experienced interrupted income or unemployment the pandemic also has resulted in continuing volatility to the global and us financial markets although intensive relief actions by the us congress and regulatory agencies intended to mitigate the extent of adverse economic effects have stabilized financial markets and liquidity including with respect to equity prices and corporate credit spreads for truist and the banking sector in comparison to the prior quarter as a result of these considerations truist performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill carried by the cbw ccb and ih reporting units for impairment in the second quarter of to determine whether it was morelikelythannot the fair value of one or more of its reporting units was below its respective carrying amount as of periodend in performing this assessment truist considered macroeconomic and market factors industry and banking sector events a sensitivity analysis on managements forecast and assumptions and truist specific performance indicators including any changes from when the merger closed in december despite the adverse economic and still uncertain environment caused by the pandemic truists second quarter results reflected profitable performance across each of its reporting units strong capital and liquidity levels that have facilitated swift actions in support of clients teammates and communities and truists affirmation that it remains committed to achieving its merger value proposition including targeted net cost saves based on the qualitative assessment performed truist concluded that it was not morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of june and therefore no triggering event occurred that required a quantitative goodwill impairment test if economic conditions deteriorate or the pandemics effects prolong or worsen it may be morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of truists reporting units falls below its respective carrying amount which would require a quantitative goodwill impairment test acl truists policy is to maintain an acl which represents managements best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and offbalance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and managements judgement the models are designed to forecast probability of default exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic variables to historical experience the models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to an historical average over a one year period expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a tdr a qualitative allowance which incorporates managements judgement is also included in the estimation of expected future loan and lease losses including qualitative adjustments in circumstances where the model output is inconsistent with managements expectations with respect to expected credit losses this allowance is used to capture risks in the portfolio such as considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events the outcomes of which are uncertain these events may include but are not limited to political conditions legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in which truist conducts business truist financial corporation loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and significant loans that are considered collateraldependent are individually evaluated for these loans the alll is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral if any for tdrs default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the alll the methodology used to determine an estimate for the rufc is inherently similar to that used to determine the funded component of the alll and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable the rufc is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments including the probability of funding and exposure at default a detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the acl is included in note basis of presentation
