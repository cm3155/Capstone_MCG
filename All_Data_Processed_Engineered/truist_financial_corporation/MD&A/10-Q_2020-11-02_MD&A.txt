additional disclosures under the section titled risk management market risk management market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices including interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truists strategic financial objectives truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists bus interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options inherently embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk other than trading as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities since interest rate changes are out of the control of any private sector institution truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities taking into account the volumes maturities and mix with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk i simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates ii analysis of interest rate shock scenarios and iii analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates the companys simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truists assets and liabilities the model also considers truists current and prospective liquidity position current balance sheet volumes and projected growth andor contractions accessibility of funds for shortterm needs and capital maintenance deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process truist applies an average deposit beta the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes of approximately to its nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts for determining its interest rate sensitivity nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables including noninterestbearing deposits to determine the impact these variables could have on the companys interest rate risk position the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk truist financial corporation the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below table interest sensitivity simulation analysis interest rate scenario annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income linear change in prime rate bps prime rate sep sep sep sep up up no change down down the down and rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect down and basis points for all rate indices rate sensitivity increased compared to the prior periods primarily driven by loan and deposit mix changes related to the merger and recent activity increased fixed rate funding and increased noninterestbearing deposits management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterestbearing demand deposits consistent with the industry truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source the behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of truist a loss of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of truists balance sheet as the company would increase interestbearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source the following table shows the results of truists interestrate sensitivity position assuming the loss of demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits under various scenarios for purposes of this analysis truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at table deposit mix sensitivity analysis linear change in rates bps base scenario at september302020 results assuming a billion decrease in noninterestbearing demand deposits up up the base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at september as presented in the preceding table if rates increased basis points truist could absorb the loss of billion or of noninterestbearing deposit balances and replace them with managed rate deposits with a beta of before becoming neutral to interest rate changes truist also uses an eve analysis to focus on longerterm projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates this measure allows truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the net interest income simulation period the eve model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets liabilities and derivative instruments the difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as eve the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on eve table eve

position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions prior to the integration of the two institutional broker dealer businesses to form truist securities in the third quarter of truist operated two historical var models and the aggregate companywide var across the systems was determined additively with no benefit of diversification the heritage bbt var model was retired following the formation of truist securities following the formation of truist securities var is calculated on a consolidated basis using the truist var engine for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing profit and loss attribution and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of risk from each of the individual subportfolios as such risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories thereby creating a portfolio diversification benefit the

banklevel basis in this regard managements overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital targets which are above the regulatory well capitalized minimums management has implemented stressed capital ratio minimum targets to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above minimums

capital levels above all regulatory minimums the current capital conservation buffer of basis points was replaced by the scb of basis points effective october truist financial corporation during the first quarter of as market conditions evolved truist received board approval to establish new interim operating targets that provide for sufficient capital levels while allowing the company to support clients through the economic downturn these interim operating targets will be evaluated as economic conditions evolve while nonrecurring events or management decisions may result in the company temporarily falling below its operating minimum guidelines for one or more of these ratios it is managements intent to return to these targeted operating minimums within a reasonable period of time through capital planning such temporary decreases below the operating minimums shown above are not considered an infringement of truists overall capital policy provided a return above the minimums is forecasted to occur within a reasonable time period in august the federal reserve informed truist of its final scb of basis points for riskbased capital ratios this buffer which was determined based on stress testing results developed by the federal reserve is basis points above the capital conservation buffer the scb will be effective from october through september at which point a revised scb

financial markets and the macroeconomic outlook truists review of the results of the ccar supervisory stress test notes that the modeled outcomes shown by the frb differ from those calculated by the company truist believes those differences are attributable to the application of purchase accounting associated with the merger purchase accounting adjustments could result in a reduction in provision expense and an increase in preprovision net revenue these differences could result in higher capital ratios than were reflected in the ccar results truists capital ratios are presented in the

december additional disclosures regarding the effects of new accounting pronouncements are included in the note basis of presentation included herein except for the items noted below there have been no changes to the significant accounting policies during intangible assets the severe economic disruption and related financial effects of the covid19 pandemic have impacted truists businesses truists commercial clients have experienced varying levels of disruptions to business activity supply chains and demand for products and services additionally many consumer clients have experienced interrupted income or unemployment the pandemic also has resulted in continuing volatility to the global and us financial markets although intensive relief actions by the us congress and regulatory agencies intended to mitigate the extent of adverse economic effects have stabilized financial markets and liquidity including with respect to equity prices and corporate credit spreads for truist and the banking sector in comparison to earlier in the year as a result of these considerations truist performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill carried by the cbw ccb and ih reporting units for impairment in the third quarter of to determine whether it was morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units was below its respective carrying amount as of periodend in performing this assessment truist considered macroeconomic and market factors industry and banking sector events a sensitivity analysis on managements forecast and assumptions and truist specific performance indicators including any changes from when the merger closed in december despite the adverse economic and still uncertain environment caused by the pandemic truists third quarter results reflected profitable performance across each of its reporting units strong capital and liquidity levels that have facilitated swift actions in support of clients teammates and communities and truists affirmation that it remains committed to achieving its merger value proposition including targeted net cost saves based on the qualitative assessment performed truist concluded that it was not morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of september and therefore no triggering event occurred that required a quantitative goodwill impairment test if economic conditions deteriorate or the pandemics effects prolong or worsen it may be morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of truists reporting units falls below its respective carrying amount which would require a quantitative goodwill impairment test truist financial corporation acl truists policy is to maintain an acl which represents managements best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and offbalance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and managements judgement the models are designed to forecast probability of default exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic variables to historical experience the models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to longterm historical loss conditions over a one year period expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a tdr a qualitative allowance which incorporates managements judgement is also included in the estimation of expected future loan and lease losses including qualitative adjustments in circumstances where the model output is inconsistent with managements expectations with respect to expected credit losses this allowance is used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to the current economic conditions and capture risks in the portfolio such as considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events the outcomes of which are uncertain these events may include but are not limited to political conditions legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in which truist conducts business loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and significant loans that are considered collateraldependent are individually evaluated for these loans the alll is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral if any for tdrs default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the alll the methodology used to determine an estimate for the rufc is similar to that used to determine the funded component of the alll and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable the rufc is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments including the probability of funding and exposure at default a detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the acl is included in note basis of presentation
