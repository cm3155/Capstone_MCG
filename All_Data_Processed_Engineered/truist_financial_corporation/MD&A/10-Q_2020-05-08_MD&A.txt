lien is in the process of foreclosure truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional chargeoffs or reserves are warranted these valuations are updated at least annually thereafter truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien unless the first lien is held or serviced by truist as a result using migration assumptions that are based on historical experience and adjusted for current trends truist estimates the volume of second lien positions where the first lien is delinquent and adjusts the alll to reflect the increased risk of loss on these credits

monitor manage and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities effective risk management involves appropriately managing risk to optimize risk and return and operate in a safe and sound manner while ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations the companys risk management framework is designed to ensure that business strategies and objectives are executed in alignment with its risk appetite truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports transparency and escalation of risks across the organization all teammates are responsible for upholding the companys purpose mission and values and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the companys culture the truist code of ethics guides the companys decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations risktaking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive riskadjusted returns while preserving asset value and capital compensation decisions take into account a teammates adherence to and successful implementation of truists risk values and associated policies and procedures the companys compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risktaking behavior truist employs a comprehensive change management program to manage the risks associated with integrating heritage bbt and heritage suntrust the board and executive leadership oversee the change management program which is designed to ensure key decisions are reviewed and that there is appropriate oversight of integration activities refer to truists annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for additional disclosures under the section titled risk management market risk management market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices including interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices truist financial corporation effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truists strategic financial objectives truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists bus interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options inherently embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk other than trading as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities since interest rate changes are out of the control of any private sector institution truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities taking into account the volumes maturities and mix with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk i simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates ii analysis of interest rate shock scenarios and iii analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates the companys simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truists assets and liabilities the model also considers truists current and prospective liquidity position current balance sheet volumes and projected growth andor contractions accessibility of funds for shortterm needs and capital maintenance deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process truist applies an average deposit beta the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes of approximately to its nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts for determining its interest rate sensitivity nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables including noninterestbearing deposits to determine the impact they could have on the companys interest rate risk position the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below table interest sensitivity simulation analysis interest rate scenario annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income linear change in prime rate bps prime rate mar mar mar mar up up no change down na down the down rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect down basis points for all rate indices rate sensitivity increased compared to the prior periods primarily driven by loan and deposit mix changes related to the merger and recent activity increased fixed rate funding and increased noninterestbearing deposits truist has established parameters related to interest rate sensitivity measures that prescribe a maximum impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios that would result in an escalation to the board the following parameters and interest rate scenarios are considered truists primary measures of interest rate risk maximum impact on net interest income of for the next months assuming a basis point change in interest rates each quarter for four quarters and a maximum impact on net interest income of for an immediate basis point parallel change in rates truist financial corporation this interest rate shock analysis is designed to create an outer bound of acceptable interest rate risk truist also uses an eve analysis to focus on longerterm projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates this measure allows truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the net interest income simulation period the eve model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets liabilities and derivative instruments the difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as eve the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on eve table eve simulation analysis change in interest rates bps hypothetical percentage change in eve mar mar up no change down truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities commercial loans msrs and mortgage banking operations longterm debt and other funding sources truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities as of march truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling billion with an associated net fair value of billion see note derivative financial instruments for additional disclosures libor in its current form may no longer be available after truist has liborbased contracts that extend beyond to prepare for the possible transition to an alternative reference rate management has formed a crossfunctional project team to address the libor transition the project team has performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from libor to a new index the project provides regular reports to the board the project team is reviewing contract fallback language for loans and leases and noted that certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition and the team is coordinating with impacted lines of business to update libor fallback language generally consistent with the arrc recommendation truist is continuing to evaluate the impact on these contracts and other financial instruments systems implications hedging strategies and other related operational and market risks market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions at transition for a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of libor and the transition to alternative reference rates refer to the section titled item risk factors in the form 10k for the year ended december market risk from trading activities truist also manages market risk associated with trading activities as a financial intermediary truist provides its clients access to derivatives foreign exchange and securities markets trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach which includes measuring risk using var stress testing and sensitivity analysis risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both trading desks and at the aggregate portfolio level to ensure exposures are in line with truists risk appetite truist is subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule issued jointly by the occ us treasury frb and fdic covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities specifically those held for the purpose of shortterm resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected shortterm price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits truists trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for our clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker across different asset classes truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange loan trading and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation

underlying assets that materially affect valuation and performance securitization positions are subject to truists comprehensive risk management framework which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits there were no offbalance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of march varbased measures var measures the estimated potential loss at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions following the merger truist elected to migrate all covered positions to the heritage suntrust var system and methodology for an interim period however var for a subset of heritage bbt positions specifically those covered positions held in bbt securities will be calculated using the heritage bbt var system and methodology as such pending full integration truist will operate two historical var models and aggregate companywide var will be determined additively with no benefit of diversification for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing profit and loss attribution and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of risk from each of the individual subportfolios as such risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories thereby creating portfolio diversification benefit the following table summarizes certain varbased measures for the three months ended march and the increase from the prior year

truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital and comprehensive risk measure capital requirements do not apply var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model there were seven companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended march primarily driven by the covid19 pandemic which led to a sudden and significant repricing of financial markets amid an increase in market volatility and deterioration in overall market liquidity in accordance with established policy and procedure all companywide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance following such reviews it was determined that the var model performed in line with expectations however the extreme moves in underlying market risk factors caused by the covid19 pandemic would not typically have been captured within the 1day var measure truist financial corporation model risk management mrm is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models the validation activities are conducted in accordance with mrm policy and standards which includes regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis as part of ongoing monitoring efforts the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets assess evolving modeling approaches and to identify potential model enhancement stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks

intangible assets the severe economic disruption and related financial effects of the covid19 pandemic have impacted truists businesses truists commercial clients have experienced varying levels of disruptions to business activity supply chains and demand for products and services additionally many consumer clients have experienced interrupted income or unemployment the pandemic also resulted in significant volatility to the global and us financial markets negatively impacting equity prices and corporate credit spreads including for the banking sector and truist in response to the pandemics adverse effects intensive relief actions by the us congress and regulatory agencies are intended to mitigate the extent of adverse economic effects while also stabilizing financial markets and liquidity as a result of these considerations truist performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill carried by the cbw ccb and ih reporting units for impairment in the first quarter of in performing this assessment truist considered whether macroeconomic and market factors industry and banking sector events a sensitivity analysis on managements forecast and assumptions and truist specific performance indicators including any changes from when the merger closed in december would morelikelythannot reduce the fair value of one or more of its reporting units below its respective carrying amount as of periodend despite the adverse economic and highly uncertain environment caused by the pandemic trusts first quarter results reflected profitable performance across each of its reporting units strong capital and liquidity levels that have facilitated swift actions in support of clients teammates and communities and truists affirmation that it remains committed to achieving its merger value proposition including targeted net cost saves based on the qualitative assessment performed truist concluded that it was not morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of march and therefore no triggering event occurred that required a quantitative goodwill impairment test if economic conditions deteriorate or the pandemics effects prolong or worsen it may be morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of truists reporting units falls below its respective carrying amount which would require a quantitative goodwill impairment test truist financial corporation acl truists policy is to maintain an acl which includes the alll and the rufc which represents managements best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and offbalance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and managements judgement the models are designed to forecast probability of default exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic variables to historical experience the models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to an historical average over a one year period expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity estimated through contractual maturity giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a tdr a qualitative allowance which incorporates managements judgement is also included in the estimation of expected future loan and lease losses this allowance is used to capture risks in the portfolio such as considerations with respect to the impact of current economic events the outcomes of which are uncertain these events may include but are not limited to political conditions legislation that may directly or indirectly affect the banking industry and economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas and industries in which truist conducts business loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and significant loans that are considered collateraldependent are individually evaluated for these loans the alll is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral if any for tdrs default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the alll the methodology used to determine an estimate for the rufc is inherently similar to that used to determine the funded component of the alll and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable the rufc is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments including the probability of funding and exposure at default a detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the acl is included in note basis of presentation
