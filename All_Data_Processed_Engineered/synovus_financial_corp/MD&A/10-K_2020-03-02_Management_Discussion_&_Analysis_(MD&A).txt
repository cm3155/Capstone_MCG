reporting policies of synovus are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies consisting of those related to the accounting for the allowance for loan losses fair value measurements and income taxes in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates it is managements practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee on a periodic basis including the development selection implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus consolidated financial statements synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are applied in the application of these policies allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a significant accounting estimate that represents managements best estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower significant judgments and estimates are necessary in the determination of the allowance for loan losses significant judgments include among others loan risk ratings and classifications the determination and measurement of impaired loans the timing of loan chargeoffs the probability of loan defaults the net loss exposure in the event of loan defaults the loss emergence period qualitative loss factors as well as other qualitative considerations in determining the allowance for loan losses management makes numerous assumptions estimates and assessments which are inherently subjective the use of different estimates or assumptions could have a significant impact on the provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses nonperforming loans loan chargeoffs financial condition and results of operations a detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the all as well as information regarding recently issued accounting standards related to the allowance are included in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies of this report fair value measurements synovus evaluates assets liabilities and other financial instruments that are either required or elected to be recorded reported or disclosed at fair value the fair value of these instruments is determined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date synovus updates the fair value measurements of each instrument on a periodic basis but no less than quarterly synovus selects the most appropriate technique for determining the fair value of the asset or liability the degree of management judgment involved in determining fair value is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices or observable market data there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring the fair value of financial instruments based on quoted market prices however when quoted prices and observable market data are not available synovus uses a valuation technique requiring significant judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value see part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies and part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note fair value accounting of this report for further discussion of fair value measurements and synovus use of various fair value methodologies and the types of assets and liabilities in which fair value accounting is applied synovus accounts for acquired assets and liabilities at their respective fair values using the acquisition method of accounting determination of the fair value often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques which are inherently subjective additionally the amortization of identified intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received which is also subjective typically acquisitions result in the recognition of goodwill which is subject to periodic impairment tests synovus applies asc goodwill subsequent measurement qualitative assessment for its determination of impairment refer to part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies and part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note goodwill and other intangible assets in this report for a description of the impairment testing process and key assumptions management utilizes to perform its qualitative assessment income taxes the calculation of synovus income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination as part of synovus overall business strategy management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration as such the company is often required to exercise significant judgment regarding the interpretation of these tax laws and regulations in which synovus anticipated and actual liability could significantly vary based upon the taxing authoritys interpretation specifically significant estimates in accounting for income taxes relate to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets estimates of the realizability of income tax credits utilization of nols the determination of taxable income and the determination of uncertain tax positions and temporary differences between book and tax bases adjustments to these items may occur due to modifications in tax rates newly enacted laws issuance of tax regulations resolution of items with taxing authorities alterations to interpretative statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that affects the companys tax positions methods or election s changes or other facts and circumstances management closely monitors tax developments and the potential timing of these changes in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the companys overall tax position and the estimates and judgments used in determining the income tax provision and records adjustments as necessary see part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies and part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note income taxes in this report for additional details discussion of financial condition and results of operations investment securities available for sale

strategically repositioned certain securities in its legacy portfolio to improve liquidity and portfolio performance the investment securities portfolio had a weighted average duration of years at december which compared to years at december the reduction in portfolio duration was primarily attributable to the increase in anticipated prepayment rates as a result of the decline in longterm
