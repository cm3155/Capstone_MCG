reserve has aggressively tightened monetary policy by significantly raising market interest rates throughout and with estimates calling for a higher fomc policy rate for longer the extent of interest rate increases and the period of time that these higher rates will remain in effect continues to depend on the level of inflation and strength of the labor market outside of inflation economic uncertainty and market disruptions remain including geopolitical tensions from conflict in the middle east russias prolonged war in ukraine the strained relationship between the us and china and to a

was lower for the three months ended september but higher for the nine months ended september primarily due to a change in the timing and mix of discrete tax items recognized in the comparable periods these items include tax benefits from sharebased compensation the accrual and release of reserves for uncertain tax positions and accounting for changes in tax laws all of which can vary significantly and affect comparability from period to period credit quality capital resources and liquidity credit quality synovus diligently monitors the quality of its loan portfolio by industry property type and

capital to the consolidated financial statements of synovus form 10k management reviews the companys capital position on an ongoing basis and believes based on internal capital analyses and earnings projections that synovus is well positioned to meet relevant regulatory capital standards on january synovus announced that its board of directors approved a capital plan that included a increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to per share beginning with the quarterly dividend payable in april and authorized share repurchases of up to million in synovus has not repurchased any shares during on august the federal banking regulators issued a final rule that allowed electing banking organizations that adopted cecl during to mitigate the estimated effects of cecl on regulatory capital for two years followed by a threeyear phasein transition period synovus adopted cecl on january and the september regulatory capital ratios reflect synovus election of the fiveyear transition provision at september million or a cumulative bps benefit to cet1 was deferred dividends synovus has historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of its common stock management and the board of directors closely monitor current and projected capital levels liquidity including dividends from subsidiaries financial markets and other economic trends as well as regulatory requirements regarding the payment of dividends synovus ability to pay dividends on its common stock and preferred stock is primarily dependent upon dividends and distributions that it receives from its bank and nonbanking subsidiaries which are restricted by various regulations administered by federal and state bank regulatory authorities synovus declared common stock dividends of million or per common share for the nine months ended september compared to million or per common share for the nine months ended september in addition synovus declared dividends on its preferred stock of million for the nine months ended september compared to million for the nine months ended september liquidity liquidity represents the extent to which synovus has readily available sources of funding to meet the needs of depositors borrowers and creditors to support asset growth and to otherwise sustain operations of synovus and its subsidiaries at a reasonable cost on a timely basis and without adverse consequences alco monitors synovus economic competitive and regulatory environment and is responsible for measuring monitoring and reporting on liquidity and funding risk as well as market risk in accordance with synovus policies and regulatory guidance alco evaluates contractual and anticipated cash flows under normal and stressed conditions to properly manage the companys liquidity profile synovus places an emphasis on maintaining numerous sources of current and contingent liquidity to meet its obligations to depositors borrowers and creditors on a timely basis liquidity is generated through various sources including but not limited to maturities and repayments of loans by clients maturities and sales of investment securities and growth in core and wholesale deposits synovus bank also generates liquidity through the issuance of brokered certificates of deposit and money market accounts synovus bank accesses funds from a broad geographic base to diversify its sources of funding and liquidity synovus bank also has the capacity to access funding through its membership in the fhlb system and the federal reserve management continuously monitors and maintains appropriate levels of liquidity so as to provide adequate funding sources to manage client deposit withdrawals loan requests and other funding demands core deposit balances have increased by million compared to december fluctuations among deposit categories including a billion decrease in noninterestbearing demand deposits and a billion decline in money market accounts with an offsetting billion increase in time deposits has primarily been a function of the rate environment as well as deployment of excess cash in the case of noninterestbearing deposits compared to the linked quarter we have started to see a slowing in the trend of clients shifting between time deposits and money market accounts synovus continues to proactively manage its liquidity position which has included increasing brokered deposits and robust contingent liquidity is maintained across a diverse set of sources which include immediately available funds as well as funds we expect to be available within short notice contingent liquidity sources include primary sources such as fhlb borrowing capacity frb cash reserves and thirdparty consumer loans which includes our decision to sell loans from this portfolio and strategic runoff while secondary sources consist of the federal reserve discount window fed funds lines and other sources like the frbs bank term funding program at september contingent sources of liquidity totaled approximately billion and based on currently pledged collateral synovus bank had access to fhlb funding of billion subject to fhlb credit policies synovus was able to improve its liquidity position by reducing our reliance on wholesale funding by billion during the third quarter of in addition to bank level liquidity management synovus must manage liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including the servicing of debt the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock payment of general corporate expense and potential capital infusions into subsidiaries the primary source of liquidity for synovus consists of dividends from synovus bank which is governed by certain rules and regulations of the ga dbf and the federal reserve bank synovus ability to receive dividends from synovus bank in future periods will depend on a number of factors including without limitation synovus banks future profits asset quality liquidity and overall condition in addition both the ga dbf and federal reserve bank may require approval to pay dividends based on certain regulatory statutes and limitations on february synovus bank issued million aggregate principal amount of senior bank notes due and the notes will mature on february the notes will bear interest at per annum payable semiannually in arrears on each february and august beginning on august synovus bank may not redeem the notes prior to august the redemption price for any redemption in whole or in part at our option on or after august and prior to january is equal to the greater of a the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date assuming the notes matured on january on a semiannual basis assuming a 360day year consisting of twelve 30day months at the treasury rate plus basis points less b interest accrued to the date of redemption and of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus in either case accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date the redemption price for any redemption after january is of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date the notes are not redeemable at the option or election of holders during the three and nine months ended september synovus repurchased million and million respectively of its fixedtofloating rate subordinated notes on the open market and recognized gains of thousand and thousand respectively on the early extinguishment of debt the company may continue to redeem any outstanding debt as it deems appropriate and as permitted per regulatory approvals if so required and compliance with laws synovus presently believes that the sources of liquidity discussed above including existing liquid funds on hand are sufficient to meet its anticipated funding needs see part ii item risk factors recent negative developments in the banking industry could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations of our quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended march and part i item risk factors changes in the cost and availability of funding due to changes in the deposit market and credit market may adversely affect our capital resources liquidity and financial results of synovus form 10k furthermore synovus may from time to time take advantage of attractive market opportunities to refinance retire or repurchase its existing debt redeem its preferred stock or strengthen its liquidity or capital position earning assets and sources of funds average total assets for the nine months ended september increased billion or as compared to the first nine months of average earning assets increased billion or in the first nine months of compared to the same period in the increase in average earning assets primarily resulted from a billion or increase in average total loans net of unearned income primarily attributable to growth in commercial loans largely in the second half of as well as increased line utilization and low levels of payoffs average interestbearing liabilities increased billion or for the first nine months of compared to the same period in the increase in average interestbearing liabilities largely resulted from a billion increase in brokered deposits a billion increase in time deposits and a billion increase in longterm debt partially offset by a billion decrease in money market accounts the increases in brokered deposits and longterm debt were largely due to the ongoing management of our liquidity position which also included the february issuance of million par value synovus bank senior notes the increase in time deposits and decrease in money market accounts were correlated as fluctuations between these categories have been driven by the rate environment average noninterestbearing deposits decreased billion or for the first nine months of compared to the same period in primarily due to the continued pressures from the rate environment and client deployment of excess funds net interest income for the nine months ended september was billion up million or compared to the same period in net interest margin was up bp over the comparable nine month period to as the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet and average loan growth were largely offset by continued increases in funding costs on a sequential quarter basis net interest income was down million or impacted largely by continued higher deposit costs net interest margin for the third quarter was down bps compared to the second quarter of as the asset side of our balance sheet continued to benefit from higher rates but the associated lagged impact from higher deposit pricing combined with remixing within our noninterestbearing deposits resulted in margin compression we expect net interest margin in the fourth quarter of to contract at a pace similar to the third quarter of followed by expectations for a relatively stable margin in the first quarter of net interest income and ratevolume analysis the following tables set forth the major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields and rates for the three and nine months ended september and as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in

interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which synovus is potentially exposed synovus measures the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates through the use of simulation modeling which incorporates all of synovus earning assets and liabilities these simulations are used to determine a baseline net interest income projection and the sensitivity of the income profile based on changes in interest rates these simulations incorporate assumptions and factors including but not limited to changes in market rates in the size or composition of the balance sheet and in repricing characteristics as well as client behaviors this includes estimates for deposit repricing characteristics which for purposes of the sensitivity estimates provided below relies upon a constant throughthecycle total deposit cost beta of approximately as of the most recently reported period this process is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis in a manner consistent with synovus alco governance framework synovus has modeled its baseline net interest income forecast assuming a relatively flat interest rate environment with the federal funds rate at the federal reserves targeted range of to as of september and the prime rate of as of september synovus has modeled the impact of an immediate change in market interest rates across the yield curve of and bps to determine the sensitivity of net interest income for the next twelve months as illustrated in the table below the net interest income sensitivity derived from this simulation suggests that net interest income is projected to increase by and if interest rates increased by and bps respectively net interest income is projected to decrease by and if interest rates decreased by and bps respectively the following table represents the estimated sensitivity of net interest income at september with comparable information for december table twelve month net interest income sensitivity estimated change in net interest income as compared to unchanged rates for the next twelve months change in interest rates in bps september december while all of the above estimates are reflective of the general interest rate sensitivity of synovus local market conditions the realized growth and remixing of the balance sheet as well as the broader macroeconomic environment could all have a significant impact on both the sensitivity and realized level of net interest income additionally should there be differences between realized deposit betas for a given level of rates as compared to the companys estimates for throughthecycle betas this may also have a significant impact on our reported sensitivity and the realized level of net interest income the net interest income simulation model is the primary tool utilized to evaluate potential interest rate risks over a shorterterm time horizon synovus also evaluates potential longerterm interest rate risk through modeling and evaluation of the sensitivity of the companys eve the eve measurement process estimates the net fair value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments under various interest rate scenarios management uses eve sensitivity analyses as an additional means of measuring interest rate risk and incorporates this form of analysis within its governance and limits framework synovus is also subject to market risk in certain of its fee income business lines financial management services revenue which include trust brokerage and asset management fees can be affected by risk in the securities markets primarily the equity securities market a significant portion of the fees in this unit are determined based upon a percentage of asset values weaker securities markets and lower equity values have an adverse impact on the fees generated by these operations trading account assets maintained to facilitate brokerage client activity are also subject to market risk however trading activities are limited and subject to risk policy limits additionally synovus utilizes various tools to measure and manage price risk in its trading portfolio mortgage banking income is also subject to market risk mortgage loan originations are sensitive to levels of mortgage interest rates and therefore mortgage banking income can be negatively impacted during a period of rising interest rates as we have experienced in the past year the extension of commitments to clients to fund mortgage loans also subjects synovus to market risk this risk is primarily created by the time periods between making the commitment closing and delivering the loan synovus seeks to minimize its exposure by utilizing various risk management tools including forward sales commitments and other economic hedges derivative instruments for interest rate risk management synovus utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to various types of structural interest rate risks by executing enduser derivative transactions designated as hedges hedging relationships may be designated as either a cash flow hedge which mitigates risk exposure to the variability of future cash flows or other forecasted transactions or a fair value hedge which mitigates risk exposure to adverse changes in the fair market value of a fixed rate asset or liability due to changes in market interest rates as of september and december synovus had billion and billion respectively in notional amounts outstanding of both effective and forwardstarting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to contractually specified interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans as of september and december synovus had billion and billion respectively in notional amounts outstanding of receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedging instruments to hedge its exposure to the change in the fair value due to fluctuations in market interest rates for outstanding fixedrate longterm debt and fixedrate interestbearing deposits critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of synovus are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities synovus has identified certain of its accounting policies as critical accounting policies consisting of those related to the allowance for credit losses and income taxes in determining which accounting policies are critical in nature synovus has identified the policies that require significant judgment or involve complex estimates it is managements practice to discuss critical accounting policies with the board of directors audit committee on a periodic basis including the development selection implementation and disclosure of the critical accounting policies the application of these policies has a significant impact on synovus unaudited interim consolidated financial statements synovus financial results could differ significantly if different judgments or estimates are used in the application of these policies all accounting policies described in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note summary of significant accounting policies in synovus form 10k should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance there have been no significant changes to the accounting policies estimates and assumptions or the judgments affecting the application of these estimates and assumptions from those disclosed in synovus form 10k nongaap financial measures the measures entitled adjusted noninterest revenue adjusted noninterest expense adjusted revenue adjusted tangible efficiency ratio adjusted net income available to common shareholders adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted return on average assets adjusted return on average common equity return on average tangible common equity adjusted return on average tangible common equity and tangible common equity ratio are not measures recognized under gaap and therefore are considered nongaap financial measures the most comparable gaap measures to these measures are total noninterest revenue total noninterest expense total revenue efficiency ratiote net income available to common shareholders net income per common share diluted return on average assets return on average common equity and the ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets respectively management believes that these nongaap financial measures provide meaningful additional information about synovus to assist management and investors in evaluating synovus operating results financial strength the performance of its business and the strength of its capital position however these nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of operating results or capital position as reported under gaap the nongaap financial measures should be considered as additional views of the way our financial measures are affected by significant items and other factors and since they are not required to be uniformly applied they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures at other companies adjusted revenue and adjusted noninterest revenue are measures used by management to evaluate total revenue and noninterest revenue exclusive of net investment securities gains losses and fair value adjustments on nonqualified deferred compensation and other items not indicative of ongoing operations that could impact periodtoperiod comparisons adjusted noninterest expense and the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio are measures utilized by management to measure the success of expense management initiatives focused on reducing recurring controllable operating costs adjusted net income available to common shareholders adjusted net income per common share diluted adjusted return on average assets and adjusted return on average common equity are measurements used by management to evaluate operating results exclusive of items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operations and impact periodtoperiod comparisons return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity is a measure used by management to compare synovus performance with other financial institutions because it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization thereby allowing management to evaluate the performance of the business consistently the tangible common equity ratio is used by management to assess the strength of our capital position the computations of these measures are set forth in the tables below management does not provide a reconciliation for forwardlooking nongaap financial measures where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort this is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the occurrence and the financial impact of various items that have not yet occurred are out of synovus control or cannot be reasonably predicted for the same reasons synovus management is unable to address the probable significance
