focus as we pursued and won new business deepened wallet share enhanced our clients experiences and made ongoing progress in several areas of investment including maast cib and wholesale banking our relationship banking approach delivered strong growth this quarter in loans core transaction deposits and core banking fees and are a product of broadbased success across our lines of business and client segments at the same time weve maintained good expense discipline by leveraging synovus board initiatives to partially offset the inflationary expense environment that we have faced while continuing to invest in talent and our longer term initiatives the road map that we shared during our investor day back in february strikes the appropriate balance between core and transformational initiatives youll hear during todays call the positive impacts from several initiatives and investments weve outlined in our strategic plan and progress we are making towards building sustainable top quartile performance we continue to make progress on synovus forward with run rate benefits increasing to million as of march end and we remain on track to deliver million by yearend the optimization of our branch network is a synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 significant initiative within the synovus forward program with nine locations closed in the first quarter and approximately planned for the rest of the year we are also continuing to make some promising hires and revenueproducing talent and new leadership in key lines and key markets increasing our wholesale middle market team by this quarter while also expanding our specialty lending team and naming new community banking leadership in our tampa and chattanooga markets on the cib front our plan to have talent in place by the second quarter remains on track with to team members expected by yearend additionally from a digital standpoint we have continued to successfully migrate to our synovus gateway digital commercial banking platform later this month well complete a yearlong transition of all of our commercial wholesale and small business clients providing an enhanced and streamlined experience also during the first quarter we launched our mobile virtual commercial card which will make it even easier for our clients to utilize their credit facilities from a consumer perspective we heightened the engagement across our digital platform my synovus and expanded online account opening with increased product availability and expansion of capabilities and channels and launched phase one of consumer analytics which is focused on the nextbest action for our clients we also continued the measured integration of commercial analytics into how we manage credit events and borrower monitoring most notably within the community and consumer bank lines of business lastly development of our banking as a service platform maast is progressing on schedule with the second quarter pilot planned we are finalizing the selection process for the isv which we will partner with for this phase as the platform is being built we continue to add talent to our team with two new senior leaders added this quarter who both have vast experience working with fintechs integrations and technology solutions we also have signed a definitive agreement to acquire a interest in qualpay a provider of cloudbased platform that combines a payment gateway with robust merchant processing solutions which will allow merchants and independent software vendors to easily integrate payments into their software or websites the completion of this investment is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions including receipt of necessary regulatory approvals beyond the proposed investment to propel growth in qualpays core business synovus has chosen to leverage qualpays payment technology stack as an integral part of maast we believe this investment will help to speed up the delivery on maast as well as ongoing enhancements and solution expansion now lets look at slide where weve included key financial highlights for the quarter id like to begin with loans which increased billion excluding ppp or on an annualized basis our wholesale banking segment had another exceptional quarter and we also posted growth in both community and consumer banking client segments evidencing the momentum we have across the franchise commercial lending continues to be the driver of overall growth with first quarter funded production up yearoveryear what is important is that weve achieved this robust growth in a diversified fashion while maintaining our underwriting standards and adhering to our disciplined credit framework quality deposit growth continued in the first quarter driven by an increase in noninterestbearing deposits of million we continue to see growth in core consumer transaction accounts resulting from both balanced augmentation and account growth our multiyear journey focused on remixing our deposit base into lower cost sticky sources has positioned us well to manage deposit cost in this rising rate environment synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 ppnr adjusted for onetime items and excluding ppp fees was million for the first quarter this represents a million or increase yearoveryear revenues increase driven both by balance sheet growth as well as continued growth in multiple fee income businesses we would be remiss if we didnt acknowledge the recent geopolitical risk and inflationary economic environment and their potential impacts to our clients both from a consumer and commercial perspective increased prices and supply chain bottlenecks are putting additional pressure on liquidity and business activity in certain segments and may impact margins moving forward despite the challenges our credit outlook remains positive overall our strong quarter led to an adjusted eps of and operating metrics that demonstrate our focus on profitable growth jamie will now share a more detailed update on the results for this quarter andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin starting with slide id like to begin with loan growth total loan balances ended the first quarter at billion excluding ppp balances loans grew billion led by growth in ci on an annualized basis total loans were up our third consecutive quarter of annualized doubledigit loan growth as you can see on slide ci loans were up million quarteroverquarter and cre loans grew million commercial loan growth was broadbased with of wholesale bank businesses growing balances we also continue to see growth in commercial production and line utilization commercial production increased yearoveryear driven by a increase in ci line utilization increased to up from in  higher utilization from lines existing at the end of the fourth quarter contributed approximately million to loan growth in the first quarter higher utilization levels are reflective of our clients investment spend inventory level builds and inflationary pressures related to higher input and labor cost among other factors regional economic data indicates performance which outpaces the nation and showed little effects from the omicron variant of covid19 over the course of the first quarter favorable demographic trends continue to give us a cautiously optimistic outlook on the economic health of our footprint in relative to the rest of the country this perspective is underscored by conversations with clients and other industry participants within our footprint as we turn to slide we continue to see positive trends within our deposit base even as deposit growth has slowed from the record pace we saw in and our focus remains the same continuing to deliver synovus to our clients in a way that leverages our platform to deepen client relationships what we saw in the first quarter was consistent with that aim with core noninterest bearing deposits up million and savings deposits growth of million quarteroverquarter our consumer banking segment with a notable bright spot in that regard with core transaction deposits up million attributable to a combination of both account growth and balance augmentation time deposits declined by million as a result of our continued focus on remixing our deposit base public funds decreased million quarteroverquarter mainly a function of seasonality beyond our core portfolio we also continue to leverage our broker deposit book as a means to efficiently manage our balance sheet and liquidity position as we forecasted on our fourth quarter earnings call we saw a notable decline in broker deposits which were down million that decline was driven by our efforts to efficiently manage our liquidity position however we do expect a return to growth in that portfolio in the coming quarters as synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 we leverage that funding source as a cost efficient means of complementing our core deposit growth and helping to fund our strong loan growth expectations our average cost of deposits declined basis point in the first quarter to this was driven by deposit mix optimization and strategic reductions and high cost deposits as previously described the first rate hike in march had very little impact on deposit cost as we were able to limit rate increases across the majority of our products we believe the deposit betas will be modest early in the hiking cycle with an expected beta of approximately for the first basis points of fomc hikes as monetary policy continues to tighten and the fomc reaches a more neutral policy rate we would expect to see increased status and as a result were expecting cumulative betas in the mid through that period as shown on slide net interest income was million for the quarter consistent with the prior quarter the first quarter nii was affected by lower ppp fee income as well as the impact of a lower day count excluding these impacts nii was up million quarteroverquarter yearoveryear nii was up aud million excluding ppp fees this represents an increase of and was driven by the strong organic growth we saw in the latter half of and which carried over into the first quarter the net interest margin was an increase of basis points from the fourth quarter as expected lower cash balances helped to support nim and offset the impact of continued decline in ppp fees looking ahead we expect to see further nim expansion in the coming quarters as the benefits of higher rates are realized to help further contextualize the impact of rate we included additional detail on our interest rate asset sensitivity on slide balance sheet asset sensitivity benefited from the continued growth in our floating rate loan portfolios which increased to of our total loan portfolio at quarter end a increase yearoveryear this was due to robust origination of variable rate ci loans asset sensitivity also benefited from recent increases in shortterm interest rate which reduced the number of loans at their floored interest rate several factors offset these benefits to asset sensitivity the increase in expectations for shortterm interest rates led to an opportunity to lock in the benefits of a rising rate environment accordingly during the first quarter we added billion in forward starting hedges we also made a slight increase to our core deposit beta functions in the first quarter largely driven by changes in the expected pace of fed tightening so those were offset somewhat by positive deposit remixing trends for purposes of our sensitivity disclosures we continue to assume a static through the cycle beta in the mid collectively as shown on slide the combination of these factors resulted in a fairly stable asset sensitivity position quarteroverquarter specifically as it relates to deposit betas we believe it is likely that betas will start low and increase as the fomc progresses through this tightening cycle both the amount of tightening and the pace of tightening are expected to impact deposit betas to illustrate how the realized beta may impact our nii profile weve included a sensitivity table this quarter as you can see adjusting the beta results in an approximate change in asset sensitivity slide shows total adjusted noninterest revenue of million down million from the previous quarter and down million yearoveryear the quarteroverquarter decline is primarily related to the million boli gain in the fourth quarter on a yearoveryear basis nonmortgage related fee income increased notable items included an increase in core banking fees of and wealth revenue of growth in core banking fees was attributable to numerous categories including card revenues and cash management fees both reflecting our investments in treasury and payment solutions in addition other core banking fees such as sba loans and merchant services improved yearoveryear a result of strong execution in synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 these business lines wealth revenue benefited from strong customer acquisition and growth in assets under management yearoveryear across all of our key wealth business lines within our retail financial advisory business managed assets grew yearoveryear primarily due to strong net inflows synovus family office grew their family account by or yearoveryear and continue to see opportunity for growth in the coming quarters mortgage revenue of million declined million from the prior quarter and down million from the prior year as mortgage rates have increased refinancing volumes have declined which has resulted in reduced mortgage revenue slide highlights total adjusted noninterest expense of million down million from the prior quarter and up million yearoveryear adjusted items were led by the onetime gain on sale of our columbus facilities offset by branchrelated restructuring charges the decline in adjusted noninterest expense quarteroverquarter is a result of prudent expense management and the normalization of expenses from an unusually high fourth quarter offsetting the expense normalization was seasonally higher employment taxes and employee benefit costs which in total increased approximately million from the fourth quarter yearoveryear adjusted expenses increased over of the increase is attributable to incentives and costs associated with elevated performance we continue to benefit from the expense saves and discipline that are part of our culture as a result of our synovus forward initiative as previously disclosed we plan to significantly reduce our branch count in we forecast that by the end of the year the run rate expense benefit from branch reductions will exceed million some of which will be reinvested in our digital delivery channel despite tight cost controls we are investing in the growth initiatives covered at our investor day such as cib maast and restaurant services and we are fulfilling our strategic commitment to add frontline bankers first quarter expenditures on new growth initiatives totaled approximately million and we are forecasting million to million in spend on new growth initiatives for key credit metrics on slide remain stable overall and at very low levels the npa and npl ratio stayed level at and respectively total past dues decreased basis points to and the criticized and classified percentage of loans remained at the net chargeoff ratio which was for the quarter continued to remain at historically low levels this quarter the economic outlook worsened due to heightened inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions because of this our multiscenario economic framework assumes a downward bias relative to the thirdparty baseline scenario which somewhat lags current conditions this increasingly negative economic outlook was more than offset by the strong credit performance of the existing loan portfolio as well as the reduced credit risk profile of recent loan growth this resulted in an acl coverage ratio of a decline of basis points from the fourth quarter while we are excited to deliver strong core loan growth our credit team remains diligent in monitoring our loan portfolios and being judicious in approving new credit risk we take on our balance sheet as we grow our business we remain committed to maintaining a well diversified balanced loan portfolio across various industries and asset classes and diligently managing credit risk within our risk appetite as noted on slide the common equity tier ratio remained relatively stable at strong ppnr continues to support organic capital creation with basis points accruing to common equity tier inclusive of taxes and the provision our focus remains on deploying this capital to our strategic priorities of strong core loan growth and a competitive common dividend which now stands at aud per share per quarter our capital position remains strong and we continue to actively manage cet1 within our to target range synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 in the first quarter we repurchased million in shares as we outlined at investor day in february our approach to capital management will continue to prioritize capital deployment that is aimed at supporting client growth paying a sustainable common dividend and accommodating opportunistic nonbank ma opportunities ill now turn it back to kevin kevin s blair president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you jamie id now like to share some updates to our guidance for previously disclosed during fourth quarter earnings the updated guidance does not include the impacts of the investment in qualpay which we currently expect to close in the third quarter and will have an overall immaterial impact on our financial statements as a result of the strong loan growth and increased utilization we saw in the first quarter as well as current pipeline levels we are raising our loan growth guidance to to for the year while the probability of a slower growth environment has increased it is important to note at this time we have not seen a significant negative impact on client loan demand attributable to either geopolitical risk or an increasing inflationary economic environment adjusted revenue is now expected to be to for the year largely a result of the elevated interest rate environment as well as strong first quarter loan growth embedded in this updated guidance is the forward rate curve as of march which assumes fed funds end the year at approximately adjusted noninterest expense is expected to be up to for the year while inflationary pressures certainly play a part in expected expense levels the increase in our expense range is driven primarily by growth and performancebased incentive expectations in addition when looking at expense increases yearoveryear approximately of the forecasted increase is attributable to investments in growth initiatives which we expect to drive revenue growth as we look past we expect to maintain strong positive operating leverage throughout the year our cet1 target range of to remains the same and we expect the effective tax rate to be lower for the year than was originally anticipated now between and lastly we remain on track to deliver our previously communicated million of pretax synovus forward benefits by the end of this year synovus forward is a combination of balance sheet new revenue initiatives and cost savings and we continue to generate benefits in each of these categories before we transition to qa i mentioned our team as i opened the call but now that we provided details on the financial performance they helped drive during the quarter i want to once again thank our team members for their incredible efforts and for their ongoing passion for making synovus truly stand out in this crowded and competitive landscape we operate and now operator lets open the call for qa synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question today comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim please go ahead with your question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess i just want to follow up i think a question that came up during the investor day around maast and banking as a service so i heard you kevin the qualpay acquisition or investment is not going to have a meaningful impact to resolve this here now that you had some more time i think since investor day thinking about the business do you want to frame for us whats the size of this opportunity revenuewise earningswise as we think about it to just give us a sense of whats the optionality thats baked into this and how we should think about it in terms of the investment thesis on the stock i would appreciate any color around that kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp well ebi its a great question weve spent time since february building out the product and as i shared in my remarks earlier that work has been built around a frontend that is being provided by qualpay and we have a backend processor our investment in qualpay we felt was important we think they have a technology stack that is superior to what other payment processors are providing it allows for more streamlined operations better reconciliation and quite frankly its much more scalable as we look to add new capabilities to the platform so number one were happy with our progress were still on track to be able to deliver a pilot product in the second quarter were looking at today three isvs to be able to conduct that but well start with one and well pilot that product throughout the remainder of and well have a full rollout in so i think its still premature to give any big revenue guidance and outyears because thats what the pilot program is all about is to be able to garner what sort of transactions well get from a payment platform the depository impact and then as you recall phase two of the program was to add a fully embedded finance program where we would have lending capabilities but i would tell you since that february date we remain very confident in our ability to develop the product but more importantly we continue to receive good feedback from those isvs that this sort of product would be something that they would want to use so theres nothing thats changed we do think it can synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 be a meaningful impact and although qualpay is immaterial from a financial standpoint we think it can be material as we use that company to build out the maast product ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks kevin i guess maybe later in the year maybe better timing to get more clarity here and one question for jamie i think looking at slide where you have your derivative hedging portfolio just talk to us around strategy around managing asset sensitivity if we do get all the rate hikes that are baked into the forward curve how do you think about neutralizing the balance sheet and defending against the risk of lower rates down the road andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim as we think about our hedging strategy you can see that we added billion in hedges in the first quarter and the thought process there is basically we looked at our asset sensitivity it was increasing and its increasing for a couple of reasons first the percentage of our loans that are floating rate continues to increase due to the growth and commercial ci lending and that will continue going forward so our balance sheet is negatively assetsensitive and itll continue to get even more assets as we move forward but then you also had the impact of the first rate hike moving loans off their floors which was another incremental increase in asset sensitivity and so we basically looked at our sensitivity and managed it through receiving fixed with forward starting derivatives and you can think about these as receiving fixed just to shade more than that we believe that is prudent if you get rate hikes from here or so youre fairly close to breakeven on this and its good for us to go ahead and lock in that benefit for that higher rate environment and so we will continue to manage our asset sensitivity we believe that the forward curve is actually a fairly likely scenario at this point given fed rhetoric but we will continue to manage that going forward consistent with what youve seen in the past ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc right thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from jennifer demba from truist securities jennifer your line is open jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 i noticed you didnt give any guidance on your future net chargeoffs or credit costs i wonder how youre thinking about that in the next few quarters and how youre what youre seeing from client sentiment right now robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp hey jennifer its bob thank you for the question and theres no doubt these metrics continue to be really good in terms of credit and specifically to your point chargeoffs but i think were kind of rangebound right now if you look at it over the last several quarters its been in that basis point basis point range in the intermediate term i would certainly not we dont see anything thats materially affecting our outlook at least generally speaking through the remainder of this year longer term there will be some normalization and i know thats a question of how you define that but our credit cost cant get much lower so naturally there would be some incremental rise over time but to jamies point earlier the way were reserving in our incremental allowance build that would begin to associate with a growing loan portfolio continued downward bias on the economics will keep us a little elevated there so from a guidance perspective i feel like were kind of in a net range at least for the foreseeable future jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks bob what buckets of the loan portfolio do you think are most vulnerable in an upright environment like this robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah that too is a great question jennifer and i certainly think about all of them but let me highlight just a couple if you think about a weakening consumer as a result of the inflation factors and the rising rate certainly those industries that have dependency on discretionary spending were watching very closely the way i think about it is i go back to covid when demand really just fell off the table and we looked at our hotel portfolio restaurant portfolio arts entertainment so i think those industries are still relatively the ones you would want to watch during a slowing consumer demand and i think at least from our perspective we really got very diligent in those portfolios we brought in our use of analytics which is now built into our sort of businessasusual platform of underwriting we look at realtime cash inflows as we showed you all during the pandemic i think that continues so anything consumer related certainly is on my radar on the commercial portfolio side specifically ci small businesses would be something we would watch and for us that portfolio is billion billion give or take depending on how you define it but those customers today continue to be able to pass along increasing cost i think over time they dont have the leverage that their larger counterparts have relative to input cost and supplier negotiations so we can certainly see some margin squeeze there and certainly top line decline so small business is one thats coming out the good news for our portfolio is over half of that is secured by real estate of some type now which gives us a little comfort in the lossgiven default scenario but those would be the ones i would call out jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks bob synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan steven please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start how are you guys thinking about deposit growth in and whats assumed in the revenue outlook that youre providing kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp so steven ill start its kevin on the deposit outlook as youve seen in the last year weve taken our strong liquidity position to continuously remix the book bringing down higher cost cds bringing down some of our brokered funds and as we sit here today at an loantodeposit ratio well continue to strategically remix where it makes sense where we can bring in the lower cost sticky deposits weve increased the percentage of total deposits being noninterestbearing up to this past quarter and so our strategy going forward would be that those categories that fall under our core transaction deposits will be the area that we continue to focus we think that those categories should grow in line with our client growth which should be in that to range as were thinking about continuing to take the growth that the economy gives us but also taking share from some of our competitors and so if you look at yearoveryear core transaction deposits are actually up so looking at the rest of the year i think you would see that to deposit growth it would obviously be far less than what weve seen in previous years as it relates to revenue growth for the rest of the year ill let jaime touch on that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah and ill jump in a little bit more on the deposit side as well because we will use broker deposits to fund the incremental loan growth as we go through the year steve and so you may see some rebuild of that portfolio which will be incremental to our core transaction deposit growth that kevin just kind of just walked through on the revenue guide we increased our guide to to we feel good about the growth outlook but largely what you see in that revenue guide increase is one an acknowledgment of the strong performance on the loan side in the first quarter but also the change in the interest rate outlook and so embedded in that is our assumption of deposit betas remaining somewhat lower for the first few hikes were assuming an approximate synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 beta for the first four hikes and then betas increasing as you go beyond that but thats really the source for the revenue guide update the to steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then the second question on qualpay could you go into a bit more detail on the functionality this provides to you and what was the thought of acquiring i think it was or somewhere around there what was the thought of acquiring the stake in the company what additional benefits will that provide to you thanks kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp so theyre an iso steven so today they provide merchant processing for third parties and so we have been the sponsor bank the acquiring bank for them for some time so weve known them we think that their technology stack differentiates them in the payment space and so acquiring of the company allows us to help set priorities for their core business which will continue to be merchantacquiring business but leveraging their development team their technology stack to fully embed into our payments platform that will be maast so they will be the front end to our program so as we sell merchant processing to these software vendors they will be using the qualpay platform that will be brought to them by synovus and so number one it helps us get the product out there more quickly and then two as were looking at expanding the maast program over time whether its through new reporting new products having that ownership interest allows us to direct investment in capital into the company to allow us to develop new capabilities steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay very good thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from brad milsaps with piper sandler brad your line is open brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co jamie or kevin maybe i wonder to start with the margin just kind of curious if you guys could comment on commercial loan yields do you think that you sort of reached a floor there exclusive of the rate changes weve seen and may continue to see just kind of curious what our starting point might be in terms of kind of where your commercial book can start to reprice up from just wanted to hear kind of what youre hearing in terms of if those yields have started to bottom out kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah brad its a good question and we did see the weighted average rate increase quite a bit in first quarter relative to where we were back in fourth quarter up actually basis points on the rate front so we do believe its still below the portfolio yield but i do think to your point weve kind of hit bottom and well continue to produced new loans at or near where the portfolio rate is which will allow us to start to expand the margin and i dont think that price competition is going away i just think credit spreads widened a bit and the environment has gotten to a position with the rate increase where we can actually put on loans that will be at or near where the overall portfolio rate is brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great very helpful and just as my follow up jamie can you kind of talk about the moving parts in the balance sheet maybe to the size of it it look like the bond portfolio at least on a period end basis was down some obviously cash to runoff those index or brokered money that you had do you still feel good about basis points for each rate hike with kind of all the moving parts that seems somewhat conservative but just want to see if you could add some color andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah we still think that in the early hikes theyre using basis points to basis points per fed move is appropriate with the beta assumptions i mentioned earlier and so we do feel good about that as you get further along and maybe pass the first basis points you could see betas increase and you could see that that margin benefit decreased a little bit a little more color though on that sensitivity is that about of our asset sensitivity is to the front end of the curve and so the basis points to basis points is really just that frontend impact and so there is a fairly significant impact by the back end of the curve and in that commentary of basis points to basis points im not really assuming a change in loan rates brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you operator our next question comes from brody preston from stephens inc your line is open synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brody andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brody preston q analyst stephens inc i just wanted to ask on the ci growth its been obviously particularly strong in this quarter you finally sort of saw a big uptick in your utilization rates and based on the chart youve put in the deck it looks like were back to levels so understanding that some of the revised guidance is due to this quarters strength but you also mentioned the pipeline i guess should we expect this to kind of hold or is there room for it to expand and i guess if there isnt room for it to expand what are kind of some of the key drivers of what you expect to be strong ci growth going forward kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp so brody ill take that as you saw basis point increase in utilization this quarter to so that created about million of growth but i think its important to dissect that million when you go back and look at the lines that were on the books the previous quarter the increased draws from those existing lines contributed only million a little less than million of that million so about million of the growth in line utilization came from new commitments and draws that we put on this past quarter now to the question of where is the line utilization going although is where we were prepandemic weve touched the line of in the past and when you think about the inflationary environment that were under as well as the portfolio mix were growing our wholesale banking lines of credit at a faster pace which typically carry a higher utilization rate we believe that we could see utilization in the range and so if you took that off of todays commitment that could contribute another million worth of growth if that were to play out now we havent included that in our to loan growth projections but we think that theres a likelihood that we could see continued line utilization increases the other thing i would just point out on ci as you noted of the growth this quarter million we had industry classifications show growth and sub lines of business produce growth so i think about it it wasnt just a utilization story it was broadbased it was very diversified across many of our businesses and across many industries and that pipeline that you referenced our pipelines are up about from where they were closing out so we remain confident that the production engine will continue in the second quarter and its not based on the line utilization continuing to go up brody preston q analyst stephens inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 got it okay thank you for that and then the last one was just on the i appreciate all the interest rate disclosures within the deck what i wanted to ask its a twopart question but its on the loan yield side jamie how are you thinking about i guess maybe you look at the floating rate portfolio obviously its got the floors but how are you guys thinking about maybe any attrition in the benefit that you would see from floating rate loans in your goforward modeling in terms of floating rate loans converting to fixed loans over time maybe losing some of those from a mix perspective is any of that factored into your goforward nii sensitivity and then secondly i noticed a big uptick in sofrbased loans so i guess i wanted to ask you sofr is acting much more like the prime rate than it is libor at least in the market so as you think about kind of floating rate loans going forward is there any benefit to pricing it on sofr versus pricing it off of prime andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp so brody good question as we think about the loan mix and the impact to the margin a lot of our as youre well aware when you look at our fee revenue a lot of our floating rate loans our clients choose to swap them and they hedge those loan exposures and then we kind of pass that through but were not assuming any material mix change around fixed float outside of the growth of floating rate lending just in aggregate just given the areas of our businesses that were growing so we do expect to continue to increase as far as the percentage of loans that are floating rate versus fixed but were not assuming any mixes within the portfolio at the moment and then on the sofr as we think about the spread impact of sofr versus libor it is uncertain but we kind of look at that as a push because we think that were giving our clients basically that spread difference on the spread and so it ends up being a net push between where we think it would have been with a more creditbased index like libor was kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp and id just add jamie we also you asked versus prime we use prime on small business loans were kind of following the industry in terms of what is market and the larger loans the wholesale banking loans are moving more on the sofr platform so were trying to keep consistent with what the industry is providing in terms of pricing terms and indices brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it thank you very much for taking my questions everyone i appreciate it andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks brody operator our next question is from brady gailey from kbw brady your line is open brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thank you good morning guys synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brady andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to start on the share buyback there wasnt a lot of buybacks in the quarter which makes sense and your loan growth was pretty robust and you had some capital impact from aoci but with the growth profile looking better now should we expect kind of a minimal amount of activity from the buyback this year kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp i think the first quarter is a good example of our strategy around capital management and leveraging share buybacks as kind of the last in line for capital management and so when we look at the rest of the year loan growth clearly was very strong in the first quarter and thats where we deployed the capital generated through core earnings as we go through the year if loan growth were to continue at the same pace then you would expect to see very minimal share repurchases but we will use those kind of as the toggle we believe the common equity tier is the right place to be in this environment with this uncertainty but youre right to assume that it likely will assume lower amount of share repurchases than either prior year or lower indiscernible brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right and then your intraquarter we saw one you have southeast banking peers in tennessee sell to outof country buyer but mostly a consumer bank is that an opportunity for synovus whether its maybe hiring some new talent or taking some customer market share kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp obviously brady anytime theres disruption in the marketplace we think it presents an opportunity for us and as you know that that competitor does have overlap with synovus i think there were some unique elements to that transaction where there were some incentives paid upfront for retention and so there may be a different tale as it relates to being able to attract some of the talent but broadly any time that we see anyone going through a major conversion or having a headquarter moved out of the southeast we look at that as an opportunity as ive shared with you in the past you have to take it almost as a process there are going to be opportunities the day its announced therere going to be opportunities when the management team switches out and therere going to be opportunities when theres a actual migration thats going on and so well have to be smart in each of those elements to make sure that synovus is planting seeds for both talent and clients to be the destination of choice if they decide they want to move banking relationships and so well go at that process similar to how weve done some of the other mergers that have happened in our footprint synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jared shaw from wells fargo jared your line is open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah maybe just following up on that you gave some great longterm goals when we were all down there in february that were based on unchanged utilization rate and as you look at the strength of customer demand and then also the first horizon opportunity how does that impact that longterm goal is it a meaningful opportunity to maybe move that higher or youre sort of expecting some of these things in the background andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp as we think about our multiyear goals its hard to react to just like couple of months of new data we clearly believe in the southeast we believe that the opportunity thats in front of us is real and its something that we capitalize on every day every day when we come into the office and so we are excited about whats in front of us we think that if you look at    those are just data points of us capitalizing on the opportunity we expect to continue we dont have anything new to say about the longer term outlook and multiyear objectives but we see whats in front of us we believe that we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of it and thats where were focused on doing jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then just a follow up on the margin benefit from higher rates you said of that is front end loaded i guess since february were seeing the 10year up about basis points if we keep the 10year near this level could that be an additional call it basis points to basis points benefit to margin or do you expect it to be higher from here to get that benefit andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 well when you look at the if you think about where that sensitivity lies it lies in our fixed rate assets on the balance sheet in both securities portfolio and mortgages and we did see premium amortization come down in the first quarter but i do believe that it could come down further even if mortgage rates stay where they are today and so you could see a little bit of a tailwind in the long end with where rates are today but its not as significant that it would be if we had a further rate increase on the long end jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator our next question is from the christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott christopher your line is open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning jamie a question for you i dont know if you mentioned this earlier but how have new loan rates changed in the last days have you seen any movement and is the next fed move really going to be the change to engage those andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp we have seen an increase and kevin did mention this a little bit earlier but first quarter we did see an increase of about basis points from the prior quarter and so we are seeing a benefit and its coming through in a couple of ways its coming through in new loan origination but youre also seeing loans come off of their floors and so that you can see that in our asset sensitivity table but were getting the benefit now of loans that were floored kind of now theyre not floored anymore and so every rate move impacts them and so we are benefiting from that we still have floored loans but each move reduces that amount and thats what youve seen kind of come through in the first quarter and we expect that to continue as we go forward christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thats helpful just want to reinforce that thanks and then on the hedge strategy does that limit the risk on the aoci side at all i know some of it is avoidable just curious if that hedging strategy tampers aoci impact andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp it does not and you could argue that it exacerbates the aoci component of that because the market does flow through on that but i do want to speak to aoci and the impact of tangible because we intentionally take duration risks in our securities portfolio and our hedge portfolio and youre well aware of our strategies there both the securities book as well as the hedge portfolio are offsets to our asset sensitivity and so we benefit when rates rise this is a partial offset to that but when we think about valuation and enterprise value in a higher rate environment our enterprise value increases now when you look solely at aoci and the valuation securities book and the hedge book those go down but thats just a partial offset to what happens to the company as a whole and so when we think about synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 tangible book value we think about aoci is basically a temporary disconnect where you have an immediate reaction to the market value of these assets but that goes away over time as the assets mature and so we believe in tangible book value growth we think that thats an important shareholder value creator but when we look at aoci and that impact we view that as basically a temporary disconnect and so thats kind of our holistic thought process around the impact of aoci and how that flows through christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks for going deeper there i appreciate it and clearly your deposits are more valuable too as rates rise so we look forward to that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp absolutely christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks jamie andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp absolutely yeah thank you operator our next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons from da davidson kevin your line is open kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co hey guys good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co most of my questions have been asked and answered just a few quick ones within the revenue guide can you speak a little bit about how youre thinking about fee revenues so if you think about the run rate what we saw this quarter and i know we saw capital markets and mortgage declining just generally how to think about that run rate going forward within that guidance thanks synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah kevin its actually a really good question because theres lots of assumptions that go into the rest of the year but we believe that for the year nir to be down around and so that would mean that for the rest of the year you would see a fairly flat nir quarterly number and theres again some puts and takes on the positive side we feel very good about the ongoing growth of core banking fees whether its on the treasury and payment solution side or continuing to return to prepandemic levels with card spend and service charges so that should continue to provide a tailwind for us maybe the biggest uncertainty going forward is on the wealth side where were putting up a little less than million a quarter depending on what the market does that will have a big impact on what our fees do we continue to have the opportunity to grow our assets under management as jamie mentioned in his remarks weve seen good client acquisition growth but when you see the type of volatility in the market and this potentially having a bear market it makes us a little less certain on what those future quarters are going to look like and then you look at mortgage we think weve kind of hit a stable mortgage number for the quarter and we think that will continue as we look into the future just based on volumes and margins and so when you add up the things that we know that are growing along with mortgage which is fairly stable the real wild card will be what happens with wealth and if we see a constructive equity market i think we could have some upside on the fee income component kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co okay thanks kevin and one quick final question for me is on the qualpay move and i understand the logic and the rationale for it but what does that replace in other words if you didnt make the investment in qualpay what would have did you have this functionality that was already going to be in place that this is kind of superseding im just wondering what the plan would have been without qualpay kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp well so early on kevin we evaluated lots of vendors to utilize for the build and which we selected qualpay so qualpay was already engaged in building out the maast platform this is nothing more than making an investment in the company to ensure that we can continue to provide the capital that will allow the company to meet todays needs but ultimately the future needs as we grow this product so they were going to be our partner either way this just gives us an ownership interest in the company to be able to help shape and drive capital into the growth of the program kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co great great very clear thanks kevin operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr kevin blair for any closing remarks thank you kevin s blair president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 thank you emily and thanks everyone for attending this morning and your continued interest in synovus just a few things ill mention before we close out todays call we were proud to recently be chosen again as the top workplace or one of the top workplaces in the atlanta market by the atlanta journal constitution the relevance of this sort of recognition in one of our biggest markets our fastest growth market is truly significant especially given our efforts to continue to recruit and retain some of the best and brightest talent in the industry also it seems like its been a very long time but we are transitioning our team member base back to being fully onsite in our workplace in the coming weeks now we will remain flexible as covid trends continue to ebb and flow and ultimately well have the majority of our organization back onsite but we have defined roles that well be able to maintain for remote capabilities and also some hybrid work schedules i just think thats the future of work we also continue to advance our esg investments and initiatives especially as we monitor the progress of the proposed sec rules for climate disclosures beginning as early as next year weve already completed our scope and ghg baseline assessments and well continue to evaluate for future carbon reductions like our branch consolidation efforts we continue to deliver on the expectations that we set for ourselves and i think its been a year of acceleration and achievement although were just through one quarter our focus is very clear its on execution and continuing to meet our shortterm objectives while expanding and extending our solutions to better meet client needs and to deliver sustainable topquartile performance i truly look forward to the next time were together to share our progress but for now i hope
