morning everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call our team delivered another solid quarter with growth in revenue and earning assets while maintaining an expense discipline that resulted in yearoveryear quarterly expenses declining additionally we continue to see an improving credit outlook that produced a release in allowance finally we continue to successfully deliver on our synovus forward initiatives and investments with the million in pretax run rate benefit achieved through the second quarter and an additional million in pretax run rate benefits to come by yearend before i proceed let me take a second to remind you of our performance todate as it compared to our expectations at the beginning of the year we shared with you that we would deliver loan growth excluding ppp and ramp it up in the second half of the year we also said we would improve the deposit mix and lower our cost of funds to stabilize the margin also we would drive efficiency initiatives that will assist in returning to positive operating leverage while continuing to manage effectively through the uncertain credit environment and produce the planned benefits from synovus forward i am pleased to share with you today that we are delivering on those objectives and we concluded the first half of with considerable momentum and are optimistic about the prospects for growth and expansion moving forward our commercial loan pipelines are back to prepandemic levels with continued growth in ci outstandings and commitments and line utilization actually increased slightly during the quarter client liquidity remained strong which has allowed us to further optimize our deposit mix and reduce our cost of funds again this quarter wed expect this trend to continue in this low rate environment our wealth and treasury and payment solution businesses are performing at a high level continued growth in operating margin expansion in these fee income generating business units will help to offset the industrywide reduction in mortgage activity criticized and classified loans declined for the quarter another proof point that the elevated credit concerns raised by the pandemic continue to abate and signal the opportunity to continue to move the allowance over time back down towards day one cecl levels and during the first half of the year we continue to invest in the future of synovus key priorities to enhance the customer experience and deliver new sources of growth a couple examples of this include our treasury and payment solutions business launched a new suite of integrated receivable solutions called synovus accelerate ar this solution has been wellreceived and the sales pipeline has already begun to fill which will create a new source of revenue while significantly benefiting our customers by saving them time and money we also have migrated approximately business clients to synovus gateway our new digital platform for business and commercial banking with expanded functionality and capabilities we are making it easier for our customers to do business and promoting higher levels of business retention lastly our smart analytics tool which weve shared previously has been further rolled out across our bankers and our markets and is beginning to have an impact on increasing pipelines and opportunities to expand the share of wallet from our customers we are also reminded during the second quarter that our focus on delivering a personalized and valueadded customer experience matters and well continue to provide a foundation for future growth industrywide synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 consumer satisfaction surveys again show that our clients are more satisfied and loyal than those of our competitors and we also received two awards of excellence for our family office during the quarter these scores and accolades are not success in and of themselves but rather affirmation that our efforts and our approaches are having meaningful impacts for our customers for all of these reasons as well as the vibrant economic expansion that we expect to continue in the southeast we remain confident in our path forward moving to slide which includes our financial highlights for the quarter total adjusted revenue of million adjusted expenses of million and a million reversal a provision for credit losses resulted in adjusted net income of million or diluted earnings per share without adjustments net income was million or diluted earnings per share pretax run rate benefits from synovus forward of million have increased by million from the first quarter results our work on completed and future initiatives continues to give us confidence in our ability to achieve an aggregate pretax run rate benefit of million by year end and million by the end of total loans excluding p3 loans were up million in the second quarter growth in the quarter was delivered in our core ci portfolio as well as thirdparty consumer lending given the continued high liquidity environment despite solid production levels elevated prepayment activity remains a headwind in our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios core transaction deposits increased million or led by core noninterest bearing deposits growth of million or with the current loan to deposit ratio we continue to remix the deposit base strategically reducing higher cost categories including cds and broker deposits key credit metrics were stable with the npa ratio declining by basis points to basis points and the acl coverage remained strong a more favorable economic outlook and a reduction in criticized and classified loans supported further allowance releases the acl ratio excluding p3 loans declined basis points to we remain wellcapitalized with the cet1 ratio increasing to while completing nearly half of our million share authorization in the quarter we also executed on additional earning asset growth activities to monetize excess liquidity while keeping capital above our operating target with that serving as an overview for the quarter i will now turn it over to jamie for a more detailed financial update and ill rejoin you later for an update on synovus forward and our guidance jamie andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin as shown on slide we ended the quarter with earning assets of billion total loans declined million led by p3 balance declines of million while gross production levels continue to improve the liquidity environment continues to result in downward pressure on loan demand while our customers are utilizing less of their line commitments we are continuing to grow overall commitments to new client relationships and deeper existing relationships the annualized growth rate and total commitments over the past two years is more than compared to an annualized increase in funded loan balances of approximately a material portion of that growth will translate into funded balances once ci line utilization begins to normalize closer to the longterm average of to based on market intelligence and conversations with our clients we believe increases in line utilization will occur later in the cycle as client liquidity subsides our base assumption included in our loan growth guidance is that line utilization will remain near current levels through year end while commitment growth will support longerterm loan growth our confidence in the forecast for the near term is based on continued strong production growth in the commercial loan pipeline and our expectation that the synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 elevated level of payoffs and paydowns will abate another factor that gives us confidence in loan growth is more recent monthly data in june total loans excluding changes in p3 balances grew by approximately million in the second quarter further declines in consumer mortgage and heloc portfolios of million and million respectively continued to be impacted by accelerated prepayment activity and excess liquidity cre loan declined about million this quarter largely resulted from accelerated payoffs as many owners are selling with the expectation that capital gains taxes will increase in ci balances excluding changes and p3 increased million with million in commitment growth while ci line utilization remain near historic lows as a reminder a normalization in ci line utilization would result in more than million in funded balances we had approximately million in fundings of round two p3 loans net of unearned fees which partially offset forgiveness of million total p3 balances ended the quarter at billion theres more detail related to p3 loan activity in the appendix lastly as a function of this liquidity environment we increased the securities portfolio about million and third party consumer portfolio about million the risk profile of asset acquisitions was largely consistent with those completed in the first quarter with emphasis in mortgagebacked securities and secured thirdparty consumer loans investment securities accounted for of total assets at the end of the quarter and could increase further as we look for opportunistic deployments of liquidity in the second half of as shown on slide we continue grow core transaction deposits which increased million or from the prior quarter this was led by core noninterestbearing deposit growth of million or which offset strategic declines in higher cost deposits we continue to have success reducing our total deposit cost in the second quarter with a reduction of basis points from basis points to basis points this was driven by a combination of deposit mix optimization with a continued focus on strategic reductions in highcost time deposits as well as a reduction in the expense associated with interestbearing deposits while the pace of cd maturities will slow significantly there are opportunities to further improve the deposit mix and reduce rates paid on other interestbearing deposits as we progress through the second half of for the month of june total deposit costs were basis points and we expect further reductions in total deposit costs this year slide shows net interest income of million an increase of million from the prior quarter nii increased as benefits from asset growth reduced deposit costs and day count more than offset the reduction in p3 fee income the net interest margin of a decline of two basis points was primarily impacted by p3 forgiveness as p3 fee accretion decreased million from the prior quarter other dynamics are similar to recent quarters and the as headwind from asset repricing is being offset by further reductions in liability cost as expected slower prepayment activity in the latter part of the quarter helped to improve the yield on the securities portfolio supporting both margin and nii based on current mortgage trends wed expect modest further improvement in that yield in the third quarter as the impact of a full quarter of more normalized prepay activity is realized deceleration of prepayment activity resulted in a million reduction of premium amortization in the second quarter down from million in the first quarter in terms of asset sensitivity we remain positively exposed to potential increases in interest rates that dynamic continues to be supported by the aforementioned shifts in our balance sheet including funding mix with the synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 estimated exposure being split between both shortterm and longterm rates as of june our loan portfolio is variable and approximately of those variable rate loans have floors at or above shortterm index rates of basis points based on current market conditions and our expectations for loan growth we reiterate our expectation that quarterly net interest income excluding p3 fee accretion should increase in the second half of the year driven by loan growth deployment of liquidity a deceleration of prepayments and further deposit cost reductions using the quarterend forward curve and absent rate hikes we expect a nim of approximately excluding the impact of p3 with headwinds from the laps of p3 fee accretion being offset by the continued deployment of excess liquidity and with notable upside coming from increases in either shortterm or longterm interest rates as weve shared previously we estimate nim dilution of approximately basis points per billion of excess cash on deposit at the federal reserve slide shows the total adjusted noninterest revenue of million down million from the previous quarter embedded in the continued strength and fee revenue is diversified growth across our fee revenue sources partially offsetting the continued normalization of the mortgage business from alltime high levels of production core banking fees were million up million increases were broadbased led by million increases in account analysis fees that benefit from our treasury and payment solutions team and our recently endsourced merchant business nsf or overdraft fees which have received a lot of attention throughout the industry were flat at million accounting for less than of noninterest revenue and of total revenues net mortgage revenue declined million in the second quarter to million due to reductions in secondary production and gain on sale this remains above prepandemic levels and we expect continued normalization in the second half of increases in fiduciary revenues of million helped offset decreases in other areas including capital markets income assets under management grew in the quarter and from the previous year the buildout of wealth management and other fiduciary services particularly in south florida will continue to provide meaningful growth opportunities total noninterest expense of million is highlighted on slide adjusted noninterest expense was million up million from the prior quarter and down million from the prior year adjusted items include the impact of an earnout liability nonqualified deferred compensation and restructuring fees primarily related to branch closures employment expense of million was down million from the prior quarter as seasonal decreases in payroll taxes was partially offset by an increase in pay days as well as commissions and other variable compensation expenses of million associated with occupancy equipment and software increased million in the previous quarter largely due to an increase in the repairs and maintenance as kevin will touch on later we continue to evaluate and optimize our branch and nonbranch real estate for additional efficiency opportunities other expenses of million were up million primarily due to the million increase and thirdparty processing fees associated with expenses from additional p3 forgiveness and thirdparty consumer loans our commitment to prudent expense management and profitable growth allows us to continue to invest in strategically compelling highreturn growth sectors we have reduced our head count yearoveryear approximately of which was on the support side this reduction in the head count is a key priority in our expense management efforts however there are some offsetting cost as we promote team members who are synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 taking on more responsibility and continue to hire customerfacing team members our expectations for expenses and benefits from synovus forward remain unchanged slide highlights stable credit metrics which remain near historical lows we continue to see improvement in the overall economic outlook which is reflected in the reversal of provision for credit losses of million and a reduction in criticized and classified loans support for the ratings improvements comes from client conversations and cash inflows as shown in the appendix cash inflows from march to may are each up more than compared to the same period from which we use as a prepandemic baseline the annualized net chargeoff ratio for the quarter was we expect net chargeoffs to remain relatively stable in the second half of assuming no material change in the economic outlook during the second quarter the npa ratio declined basis points to basis points criticized and classified loans fell and we expect further reductions as we progress through the rest of the year the acl ratio of excluding p3 loans was down basis points from the prior quarter and basis points from the end of the year we continue to use a multiscenario framework in our cecl modeling and assign a weighting to adverse scenarios weighting to the base scenario and weighting to an upside scenario as noted on slide the cet1 ratio increased basis point to as a result of strong performance the build in capital was deployed via riskweighted asset growth share repurchases and our common equity dividend in the second quarter we repurchased million of the million share repurchase authorization in place for which resulted in a reduction of average diluted outstanding shares we have completed approximately million of additional repurchase activity in july based on current conditions and economic outlook we expect to complete the full authorization in the second half of the year we will continue to opportunistically deploy capital on our balance sheet and to our shareholders as we remain above our operating target for cet1 we remained wellpositioned to complete our key strategic objectives including profitable growth with the highest priority being multisolution relationships with that ill turn it back to kevin kevin s blair president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp thanks jamie at the beginning of we laid out our synovus forward plan to deliver significant upside in earnings power through a set of strategic actions to enhance our efficiency and accelerate top line growth the synovus forward initiatives are aligned with our strategy of building a high growth low risk nimble bank that can continue to take market share in our attractive southeastern markets as i highlighted earlier throughout the second quarter we have continued to add to our synovus forward pretax run rate benefits now totaling approximately million as you can see on slide we have delivered these results through a combination of expense and revenue initiatives based upon our progress todate as well as the ongoing plan and execution we remain confident in achieving the and milestones of million and million respectively success todate on the expense front has largely come from three primary areas a reduction in third party spend a decrease in head count as well as branch and corporate real estate consolidation approximately million of synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 the million pretax run rate benefit we have achieved by the end of the quarter relates to these specific efficiency initiatives we have plans to increase the savings in each of these categories but also are adding new initiatives in areas of focus to achieve an incremental million to million in pretax benefits by the end of additional third party savings workforce optimization a reduction in branch and nonbranch square footage process automation and additional tax strategies will all contribute to drive future efficiencies we have also had success to date on the revenue side of synovus forward with million in pretax run rate benefits the treasury and payment solutions pricing for value initiative has resulted in annualized pretax run rate benefits of approximately million in the second quarter the realization of a broadbased increase in pricing has been supported by the competitive landscape enhancements to our products and services and a commitment to providing proactive needsbased advice in addition with the deployment of a new pricing tool and the continued lowrate environment we have also been able to reduce our cost to funds to levels lower than was originally expected and we now have a more robust capability and tool to better manage customer rate elasticity as we move into a higherrate environment in the future additional areas where we have seen incremental revenue include the insourcing of our merchant business and expansion of our merchant sponsorship business and expanded solutions such as trade finance and international payment and currency capabilities as we turn to future plans and initiatives the million to million in expected pretax revenue benefits will large be accomplished through analytics new products and solutions balance sheet management strategies as well as ongoing talent and specialty team expansion as it relates to analytics we continue to make progress on our four mentioned commercial analytics pilot which we refer to as the smart tool the feedback and utilization thus far are encouraging as our bankers are working to actionable leads and insights that are now translating into new sales and overall expansion of the share of wallet of our existing clients we will continue to pilot in the third quarter with a companywide rollout in the fourth in addition we have begun to develop our retail analytics program which will also have a meaningful impact in our ability to deepen the share of wallet of our consumer and wealth customers while reducing the overall levels of attrition we are expanding our premium finance and specialty lending businesses adding strong new teams in highly attractive specialized verticals as well as launching targeted innovative products and capabilities to serve as new sources of revenue growth as ive noted in the past synovus forward is a constant improvement mindset not just a collection of initiatives i am pleased with our team members focus on the art of possible as we continue to innovate and find new ways to become more efficient and drive new sources of revenue and i would be remiss if i didnt end this slide with an update on technology in general we clearly feel that our competitive advantage will come from our hightouch approach complementing our hightech investments and partnerships we continue to make progress in enhancing both the consumer and the commercial client digital experience we are partnering with the right fintechs to build and deliver new products and solutions and we have a roadmap to move to a modern core over time in a segmented and controlled fashion we will continue to focus on ways to increase online origination capabilities and evaluate new technological opportunities especially in the payment and bankingasaservice areas synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 moving to slide this includes our outlook which have a few key changes with the first half of the year behind us and greater certainty in the economic outlook wed like to provide some updates and additional clarity ill begin with loan growth we still expect to be within our to loan growth guidance excluding p3 loans and thirdparty consumer loans however we think its likely that were at the low end of this range due primarily to the elevated prepayment activity that we have seen today that was not anticipated at the beginning of the year this assumes line utilization remains at current low levels and prepayment activity returns to a more normalized level as a reminder we do not include thirdparty consumer loans in this guidance this asset class represents billion in period end balances up million in prepandemic this portfolio was approximately billion in held for investment outstandings over the past fiveplus years we have had a successful track record with originating and managing these credits providing incremental revenue and solid returns we will continue to employ this strategy as long as the excess liquidity environment persists as well as the relative returns of future purchases are constructive were raising our expectation for total adjusted revenue and total adjusted expense as a reminder its appropriate to consider these together because areas that are providing additional revenue including mortgage production and higher thirdparty consumer balances have associated expenses related to them and these examples commission and servicing expense and while we remain committed to taking advantage of growth opportunities in the southeast we also remain committed to achieving positive operating leverage and that is one of our top priorities for we are not incorporating any significant change in interest rates as part of the updated guidance although its important to note the increased asset sensitivity jamie referenced earlier as any increase in rate will provide a meaningful tailwind nii our capital management target now includes a cet1 ratio greater or equal to our target a continuation of strong operating performance and a stable economic outlook is likely to result in a cet1 ratio above even after completing the entire million share repurchase authorization for the current year additional focus and execution related to various tax strategies are expected to result in an effective tax rate of to yeartodate the etr is or before discrete items the actions weve mentioned throughout todays call further position us for success in the second half of the year but also longterm success its important to note that the efforts and continued investment in synovus strengthens our currency and provides opportunities for strategic growth both organic and inorganic were looking forward to the second half of and i feel an increased level of excitement from our entire team as we roll out our future of work operating environment this quarter our balance sheet is wellpositioned for growth with strong capital and liquidity our team members are delivering and theyre very passionate about winning and our pipeline show that clients are poised to grow their business with synovus as their partner with that ill turn the call over to our operator for the qa portion of todays call synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from the line of michael rose with raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone how are you kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning michael how are you michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc good hey i just wanted to start on the loan growth outlook it looks like if i exclude ppp and then the thirdparty loans which were up this quarter you guys were down a little bit in both the first and the second quarter if im doing the math right it looks like on a core basis ex those two lines that the guidance would imply some positive growth in the back half of the year so can you just kind of reconcile the comments around why utilization remained low paydown is still remaining high and what would appear to be a positive inflection point in those kind of core loan balances thanks kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp yeah michael its a great question i think before i talk about the rest of the year i think its important to make sure that were all clear on what happened this past quarter when you exclude ppp as you mentioned we actually grew million for the quarter large piece of that was on the ci side we grew million this quarter and that was on the backs of very strong production we were actually up versus the first quarter and versus the second quarter of last year we also grew the thirdparty portfolio roughly million and as weve shared in the past thats really a surrogate to the securities book and we felt with the excess liquidity and capital we had we would continue to make those purchases as long as the returns made sense i think on the cre side one thing thats lost in this quarter is that we also saw good increases in funded production they are up versus the first quarter but unfortunately we saw unprecedented levels of payoffs as we saw borrowers start to take some chips off the table leading up to what they perceived to be an increase in the capital gains tax so we saw a runoff there of about million so inside of the quarterly growth there are some underlying stories weve seen our pipelines return to pre pandemic levels up versus the previous quarter and in line as i said with previous year pipelines as i mentioned production is increasing across our franchise primarily on the commercial side but production in total is up from the first quarter when you look at our commercial lines of business we actually had in our sub lines business we have of the actually grew during the quarter only our cre business declined because of those payoffs and paydowns we also saw tremendous momentum going into june where ci loan growth in june was million and cre actually grew in june million dollars synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 and to your point on line utilization its not a herculean task but its up from to so were starting to see a little bit of activity there and we saw broadbased industry growth whether it was in the finance and insurance area transportation warehousing healthcare across several of our industry so in general what gets us excited about the second half of the year is that were starting to see some momentum build both through pipelines and production were starting to hear from our customers the demand is picking up and we think theres been kind of a secular move across the industry to hold more liquidity on their balance sheet which means that theyll start to borrow again before the balances completely run off from having the excess cash so were optimistic and were planning for the second half of the year to deliver that growth to be able to achieve that to but as we said we think itll be towards the lower half of that range michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great color kevin i really appreciate it and maybe just as my followup if we can hit on expenses can you give a lot of color on the synovus forward and the progress that is continuing there but i assume like everybody else youre continuing to invest in the franchise it looks like if i take kind of the midpoint of the guidance it would imply that expenses on an adjusted basis would remain relatively flat at these levels in the next couple of quarters is that the way we should think about it and maybe if you could just kind of outline some of the reinvestment initiatives and what the priorities are thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah michael this is jamie youre right on the second half of the year and expenses are expected to be flat due to increases and a few different things we have thirdparty servicing expense our portfolio there is larger than we had originally guided towards at the beginning of this year we also have increased thirdparty processing expense associated with p3 forgiveness and lastly we have variable compensation expectations we do continue to invest in the franchise specifically you see it in multiple areas first i would point to technology advancements to help us deliver our businesses better a good example of that is we recently launched the accelerate ar program which is an accounts receivable solution for our treasury customers thats only six weeks old and were now on track to receive about million in annualized revenue from that just six weeks in were also looking at our verticals were looking at our customerfacing team members and growing frontline associates where appropriate and all of that spin is embedded in our full year guidance for michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp thank you michael operator the next question comes from jennifer demba of truist securities please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 thank you can you hear me okay kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp yeah good morning jennifer andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning kevin you mentioned you anticipate synovus will migrate to a modern core over time can you give us some details on that comment kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp yeah jennifer its a part of our infrastructure investments that we believe we have to make over time now what you wont see is that synovus will do a rip and replace and move off of our mainframe core today over into a cloudbased core tomorrow what well do is well start by in a segmented fashion start to move over certain products and certain capabilities potentially create new capabilities that we could add on to the modern core or a digital platform and then over time as it make sense we would then move the core businesses over there we think thats a prudent approach versus doing it all in kind of that ripandreplace methodology and it allows us to expand our capabilities and new functionality in that agile platform with that api connection where we really need it and thats the real value of moving to the modern core as weve shared is it allows you to be much more agile in adding new solutions adding new applications and new services for our customers so thats how we would view the ability to move things over and well do that over several years where we have the opportunity to do that jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc i think the industry will follow that kind of pattern as well kevin kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp yeah i think so jennifer just because no one wants to hear that theres a massive increase in expense in order to do that so the way that you do it in a more efficient fashion is to be able to go out and do it over time in components where you move parts of your business and ultimately then it allows you to have a pathway to get all of your business over to the modern platform jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay also you mentioned youre rolling out the future of work operating environment third quarter can you just talk give us some more detail there synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp yeah so its for us we call it our here together program jennifer but i think its important to note for synovus weve already brought back roughly of our team members in the office so we have about of our team members that continue to work remotely today and so weve really spent the summer evaluating job family by job family to determine which one of those positions we felt like needed to be in the office of the time and which team members needed to have more of a flex work schedule and then that left a third set of team members that would be remote and so as were rolling this out our next level of return to work will be in the middle of august where well have those team members that now will come back to work fulltime that represents about additional team members and then at the end of august well roll out our flexible work schedule which is about another team members that will begin to come in the office three days a week and then two days offsite and that leaves us with around team members that will continue to work remotely of the time we feel that its important in todays environment for talent to assess which positions needed to work remote number one we want to make sure were testing and monitoring the productivity which we can for those positions number two i think for the competition of team members it was important for the that we identified we felt like this was a work environment perk that was necessary to be able to retain and attract the right level of talent but with all of that we look at this as the next normal its not permanent well continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our workforce and make any adjustments that we need to make going forward jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc if i could just ask one more thing how much wage pressure are you seeing right now kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp jennifer were starting to see some increases in attrition in some of our entrylevel positions and weve seen some positions where individuals can work remotely for their job and that job could be in texas or california or new york and so were starting to see a little bit of that so youll see and weve addressed that with our internal teams we made an adjustment a salary adjustment for all of our team members below kind of our median salary level and we also provide our leaders with additional pools of funds to make sure that were continuing to match or combat whats becoming a fairly competitive landscape as it relates to salary and compensation but its really started to hit us in the last couple of months and especially as it relates to those entrylevel positions jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america securities please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning eb ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i just wanted to follow up on the jennifers question around the modern core conversion kevin talk to us i mean understand youre doing it in a segmented way one what is the timeline of that is it is it beyond that and in the meantime does it not allow you to do certain things that a full conversion would just give us a sense of how important that conversion will be both one in terms of the timing and the additional capability that synovus could have in order to compete with banks or nonbanks kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp so ebrahim its a great question we havent set a timeframe and i think thats important as part of the story because to me what will determine the ultimate conversion will be the success of some of these fragmented pilots that well run so if we set up a digital bank or move some of our products over on to the new core we may test one vendor two vendors it really is a pilot for us to figure out whats the most scalable way to do that but well learn from those pilots and ultimately that will determine what the ultimate timeframe is now to your question as to limitations by doing this in a fragmented approach we dont believe so i think today we feel like we can continue to add new products and solutions that are necessary it just takes a little more time we can work with our core provider and make sure that we schedule out the timeframe thats required a great example of that is the example that jamie mentioned earlier on the accelerate ar we were able to from contract to open it up for folks to apply it was days and we did that with a mainframe core platform that needed to connect to that system so it doesnt prohibit us from doing things were just excited about the speed that what a modern core would bring to the table where you can do things even more efficiently and more less costly in the future but its not something that will inhibit our abilities in the short term ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and just tied to that would ma make it easier to accelerate that in terms of undertaking that investment or is it easier for you to do that and then think about ma of any large scale kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp i think you can look at that either way ebrahim obviously ma if you can cut costs someplace else it allows you to reinvest that weve seen that with the messaging coming out of a lot of the recent mergers but we believe that we can do it within our existing budget today i mean when i look at our technology spend this year as we shared on the call were down in expenses on a yeartodate basis yet weve increased our technology spend by and the large majority of that increase comes in our special projects where were able to add additional spend to drive revenue growth and new client acquisition so i dont think that not having a merger take place is a limiting factor either quite frankly well continue to utilize synovus forward to find efficiencies in other areas so that we can redeploy that into the areas that we want to invest like talent and technology synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator the next question comes from brady gailey with kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks good morning guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brady kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to start with the buyback its great to see you all reengage there if you include what youve repurchased in july i think youre about halfway there to your million mark but the stock is cheaper now i think you all repurchased around at tangible last quarter its now at tangible and to me it seems like you could go a little beyond the million so maybe just talk about the pull back in the stock here and if its possible that we could see buybacks actually exceed that million kind of threshold that you all talked about andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah thanks brady as we progress through weve been proactive in managing our balance sheet youve seen that both in growth and our lending partnership portfolio as well as through share repurchases as you mentioned in the second quarter as we look forward into the second half of the year i expect those same themes will apply along with our expectation for the gradual pickup and in core loan growth our core customer loan growth and thats where our priority is its ensuring that our balance sheet is positioned so that we can serve our customers best and we expect that to materialize in the second half of the year for us is not a point in time objective that we manage to its really just a target that we use for mediumterm objectives and were comfortable operating above or below the target in the short run as youve seen in the second quarter we were actively purchasing shares weve been actively purchasing shares quarter todate we believe that they are attractively valued and we will continue that plan as long as its prudent but as we look forward we do believe that core earnings will provide enough capital to cover our core customer loan growth and we should remain above target assuming no material changes in the operating outlook to facilitate the full million in share repurchase as you mentioned brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 okay and then my second question so jamie you talked about getting the bond book up to to of average earning assets youre there and now youre talking about maybe going a little higher whats the max that you think we could see as far as how much the bond book could continue to grow here andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah its a great question and typically when we think about the securities portfolio the thing about it is traditional balance sheet management and this is a unique environment right now were managing in a time where our customer liquidity is at levels unforeseen and unexpected and were managing in that dynamic we do believe that this liquidity environment will remain for the foreseeable future and were managing our balance sheet accordingly and were growing the securities portfolio in a prudent manner at of assets were growing our third party lending but its hard for me to give you an absolute level because it really depends on what the opportunities are weve been very specific in what were targeting and if you look at the thirdparty loan purchases in the first half of the year theyre great examples they are strong credit assets in asset classes that we are very familiar with with shorter durations and that aligns with our liquidity view and as we look forward into the second half of the year if we see opportunities that fit that profile then we will continue to pursue them but its hard for me to give you targets brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah and jamie what was the yield on the thirdparty consumer purchases this quarter andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp the third party purchases this quarter the largest portfolio purchase there were multiple purchases in the second quarter but the largest purchase was a little more than million in auto loans with a gross yield of a little more than brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great all right thanks guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yes kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp thank you brady operator the next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning steven kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc kevin for you i know there are quite a few initiatives already underway but with this being our first call with you as a ceo could you give us a bit of a deeper look into what you see as your longterm vision for the company kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp its a great question steven and look ill start by saying my goal for our company is to win and i know our team members feel the same way and similar to my comments earlier in the call i feel like its our job to build significant upside in our earnings power through a set of strategic actions that will allow us to improve efficiency and accelerate our top line growth and i know with you weve had discussions in the past of what that growth looks like i think thats directly aligned with what our opportunity is and that we feel like we can build a high growth lowrisk bank that can continue to take market share and in a very attractive southeastern market and so were building the and so i use the word transformation because our bank is extremely wellpositioned i feel like we sit in a great footprint we have a 133year history of performing but as i look into the future i think there are four areas we have to focus on to be able to be a bank that truly stands out number one is an ease of doing business its not rocket science what we do every day its important for us to recognize that our customers want a bank that is easy to do business with our team members want to come here every day and have to work a place that its easy for them to get their job done and so were investing time and energy in improving how we do business with our customers through process automation through our client journeys where were going to shorten cycle times and improve the overall customer experience thats important because it leads to great referrals to our prospects which generate growth the second area of focus is around being able to seamlessly deliver all of our products and solutions across all of our segments as a relationship bank we believe that weve earned the right to have a deeper share of wallet with our customers and that means that we cant deliver in silos we have to deliver as a team and we feel that we do that today but we can do a better job of delivering across our products and solutions and ultimately increase the type of solutions that we bring to our customers that will also serve as a source of revenue the third area as weve talked about in the past is well take our hightouch approach i think which shows loud and clear with some of our loyalty scores and well apply a hightech approach to match that and compliment it so well bring new technology and new solutions to the table along with analytics that will allow us to deepen the share of wallet again and expand our customer base and then lastly well focus on our team members this is a great place to work and we know that but theres opportunities to continue to improve that through professional development and compensation and other perks for our team members but also continuing to attract the top talent in the industry synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 so we believe that ultimately when you bring on those four areas of transformation along with the strong foundation we have we think it puts us in a position to stand out in the industry and deliver growth that exceeds that of our peers and that of our marketplace steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i appreciate that color kevin thats terrific can you realize that vision based on the current technology offering or do you need that modern core to get you where you ultimately want to be thanks kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp yeah steven i think over time i think to be able to compete in the very competitive landscape we need to make sure that our technology is at par with our competitors and so do i think a modern core is important yes weve done two proofofconcepts since so i think were well on the way of testing that out the goal with the modern cores as said earlier is just to make us more agile and bring more services to our customers i think the great equalizer in our industry today is fintechs we believe that partnering with fintechs allows us through the softwareasaservice model to bring new solutions to our customers and we can do that without having to have an rd shop inside of our bank and we can do it in a way thats extremely scalable and customizable so for us its about things like the modern core but then its also about having partners that can continue to add new services and better solutions for our customers like our synovus gateway product or the accelerate ar solution that jamie mentioned earlier so i think its modern core but its also about having the right fintech partners to complement that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for all that color kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp yeah thank you operator the next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning everybody kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 right now the thirdparty consumer loans are around of the total i guess looking at that dynamic of deploying the cash and with the 10year down further could we expect to see that as a percentage of the loan book maybe accelerate over the next few quarters versus putting incremental dollars into the security book down here and if so how big would you be comfortable with that portfolio youre getting andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah jared as we think about that portfolio i bifurcated into hfi and hfl what youre referring to is the total combined portfolio but the risk profile of the health for sale portfolio is very different than the health for investment portfolio so i going to focus in on the hfi portfolio as we sit here today we believe that we have the ability as far as our knowledge our experience to grow this portfolio further and get back to that billion pre pandemic level on held our investment loans on balance sheet what you should expect to see from us first is this one were not going to go out there and chase these assets just to grow the portfolio but we have found strong riskadjusted return in these portfolio purchases and we believe that were taking the appropriate amount of risk which is actually fairly low on this portfolio and delivering incremental spread visàvis the securities portfolio where you get that spread in duration and so we would much rather take it in prime credit like a prime auto securities i mean prime auto loans with a twoyear duration versus extending out on the duration curve in the securities book and so we feel comfortable at billion were not there today were not going to chase that number but that is something where we have our eye to and this liquidity environment theres plenty of liquidity to support that jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then circling back down to the capital management side here and it sounds like maybe a little bit of a reluctance to extend that buyback whats the thoughts on ma and what are you seeing i guess sort of out there in the market are there are opportunities to potentially reengage or engage in an acquisition strategy to help accelerate some of those growth goals kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp hey jared this is kevin ill take that so as weve said on previous calls we remain focused on investing in synovus and i think the next million in synovus forward will be our top of mind activity at this point and we need to be able to deliver those incremental benefits thats shared in the past i think bank ma often looks great on paper when you look at the pro forma financial metrics but i think there are challenges that are present with system and cultural integration as well as just creating growth off the acquired companys base and i think all of those challenges are underestimated so we believe that we can focus on improvements here at synovus and with those improvements our currency will improve and then that will allow us over time to consider alternatives and options in that bank ma space but for now i think the only ma that weve evaluated or would evaluate would be smaller companies that provide solutions or capabilities that would be additive to our existing customer base and those sort of businesses would have to provide elevated returns and a growth profile that align with our overarching strategies as it relates to what were seeing as you know theres still a very active ma environment i know with the executive order that came out recently i think theres been some questions as to how that will impact that synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 activity i believe that its not intended to truly impact the midcap space in terms of mergers and acquisitions if anything i think it will just hinder banks ability to close branches and may increase the amount of investment thats required for community development but i dont think its going to slow it down obviously in this lowrate environment where many banks are challenged and they look at their two and three year forecast its resulting in them reaching out to a partner and thats why transactions are happening we are very confident in our forward strategy and our ability to grow the bank and therefore we dont feel like we have to go that route today jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator the next question comes from brad milsaps with piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning brad andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co jamie im just curious anything more to do on the right side of the balance sheet in terms of i mean you mentioned continuing to optimize deposit base but just curious if theres anything on the horizon that might accelerate there on the brokered side of things with those time deposits maturing or in the other brokered accounts that you might be able to change on the right side of the balance sheet andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah first off were very pleased with the progress weve made todate in closing the gap versus peer median basis points a quarter for each of the last two quarters is strong on total deposit cost improvement we do expect to be able to continue to reduce total deposit cost albeit not quite at the pace youve seen in the last couple of quarters obviously as you get closer to zero it gets more difficult but we do think there are opportunities and to your point there are opportunities in broker deposits we do have some of those maturing in the second half of this year even though a larger wave is in early we have about a billion billion of cds maturing this quarter the third quarter i mean at an average rate of around basis points and so thats an opportunity for us to reduce deposit costs synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 as we mentioned in the prepared remarks total deposit costs were at basis points for the month of june relative to the basis points for the quarter so we think that we can continue to reduce them we have opportunities on money market and nonmaturity deposits and so we do see opportunities to continue our work in closing the gap to peer median and thats just one of our key strategic priorities as we head into the second half of this year brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thats helpful and then as my followup just was going to see if you could just add a little more color to some of the fee income lines this quarter obviously that the mortgage is pretty selfexplanatory but maybe down a little bit more than i saw it and then i know capital market is an area that you guys have invested a lot in and have been bullish on that business but maybe a little weaker than i thought but there may be some seasonality some other things that you could add some color there as well andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah you know i what i would say is if you look at fee revenue its a great success story of broadbased growth which is offset by secular trends in mortgage as well as nsf and so when we look at the growth in wealth which is not just due to equity market increases this is due to customer growth deepening relationship were seeing growth in account analysis and weve spoken in the past about the work being done in treasury on pricing for value this is extremely valuable to our company both as far as just the pure revenue but as far as also acknowledging the valueadd of our expertise in that area were seeing growth in card and other core banking fees so what we are pleased with is we cant fight the longerterm industry trend in mortgage or in nsf fees little liquidity out there but we are delivering in all of our businesses beyond those with those more secular headwind so were pleased with the growth were expecting that to continue in those areas we do expect continued normalization in mortgage and so we would expect mortgage revenue to decline in the second half of the year versus the first but we are pleased in the broadbased growth kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp and brad the only thing id add on the mortgage front i think when you look at the quarteroverquarter results theres although production was down slightly there was a fairly sizable shift in the mix over to the portfolio side so in first quarter about of our production was in secondary this past quarter it was only about so as you see our production moving to more purchase money which it will over time i think youll see more move over into the portfolio which as a just to provide background is our private wealth and our physician mortgage product and less will go into secondary the other thing this quarter that impacted mortgage revenue is the cash gain on sale and the secondary market was down in total from around down to which is where we had guided but its the very competitive marketplace obviously with the pricing of mortgages and thats an area that we expect to continue to see some pressure on that cash gain on sale brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you guys synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 operator the next question comes from brody preston with stephens inc please go ahead brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brody kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning brody brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey jamie i just wanted to circle back on the thirdparty loan purchases so i think the guidance that you all provided around the noninterest expense indicated that it doesnt include any significant changes from noncore balance sheet activity and so im assuming that those thirdparty loan purchases kind of fit into that bucket and so i guess just help me understand because these loans are yielding about and the stepup that youve seen in the thirdparty expense the run rate on that kind of indicates that youre bringing these loans on at about a efficiency ratio or so and so just given how yields have trended over the last two months im assuming that its going to get more competitive for these type of loans which might actually push the incremental efficiency ratio back to neutral as to where you guys are running right now so i guess help me understand your thought process around the tradeoffs between deploying liquidity into these loans but also potentially kind of modeling the expense run rate from here relative to the guidance andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah brody just a few points on that our expense guidance for 2021the down to down includes the associated expenses with the portfolio as it is today and so our point there is increases from here because we have not forecasted those increases thats what were referring to when you look at the second quarter growth and thirdparty processing expenses its actually a combination of two things we did have an increase in the paycheck protection program forgiveness fees as well as the process or servicing expense associated with third party loans and so when you look at these portfolios the servicing expense varies but generally its less than on these loan portfolios you are exactly right that its a very competitive market and i very much agree with you that it will only get more competitive as more people look to deploy liquidity and so were very mindful of spread compression we expect to see spread compression and well just remain diligent to make sure that these purchases actually add shareholder value obviously with this liquidity environment were leveraging the benefits of it on the right side of the balance sheet just in line with the prior conversation to reduce deposit cost optimize the mix there synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 and so were not compelled to grow assets but we do believe that if we can continue to find assets like we found in the past that we will pursue that because we believe its the right thing for the shareholder we believe that its a prudent way to deploy the liquidity brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it so perhaps once ppp is out of the equation that kind of servicing of that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah brody preston q analyst stephens inc thirdparty portfolio become a little bit clearer i guess thats andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats right brody preston q analyst stephens inc how i should think about it okay andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp youve got it brody preston q analyst stephens inc and then i guess my followup would just be on the core banking fees so this is i guess is a little bit of a loaded question because theres questions within the question but i just wanted to ask if you could talk just a little bit more about it what goes into the account analysis the nice step up you saw there and what are the specific use cases thats driving that growth maybe from the new products that youve rolled out and then on nsf you mentioned that its become a little bit of a focal point for the industry other banks are getting rid of it the cfpb seems to be willing to take a harder look here just given how low it is as a percent of your revenues have you given any thought to maybe just getting rid of it especially given the nice traction youve seen in other areas kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp yeah so brody this is kevin ill take the on the core banking fees when you look at it on a quarterover quarter basis were up up yearoveryear and youve noted one of the categories the account analysis is largely a function of those treasury services that were offering our customers some of that a large percentage synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 of the increase comes from the repricing that jamie mentioned that was pricing for value and the good news there is that it was well received by our customers any time you increase fees you have to question whether its going to lead to increase turnover or cause a problem we saw a fairly favorable response in that we had very few customers try to negotiate that increase in fee and that tells us that what were doing from a valueadded advice perspective is meaningful and so theyre willing to pay for those services the other part of that is just the increase in the amount of activity and the number of new solutions and theyre and whether its a new solution or existing product that were providing to our customers thats also the sales were up yearoveryear so our customers are continuing to request and were offering additional solutions to be able to deepen that relationship and so that is a success story and outside of the pricing increase we expect that line to continue to grow just based on our smart analytics tool which about of those insights or leads are treasury opportunities and so our bankers are starting to work those the other area in core banking fees that was up this quarter was card fees and thats just an increased spend we were up about versus first quarter and versus last year but inside of that as weve also made some investments in our commercial card and purchasing card and thats starting to show up in that were able to get more cards in our commercial customers hands and so thats a success story as it relates to overdraft you mentioned that were only about of our fee income that is derived from nsf od and thats down about from where we were in and so weve embarked on our own overdraft assistance optimization strategy where were evaluating the solutions we provide our customers today we feel that we provide a variety of banking options and for example we today offer a free checking account and a prepaid card that allows our customers to access their funds without allowing any overdrafts but we are considering some options that will add some new functionality and more specifically as it relates to the bank onstandard that i think many of our competitors are talking about and that will involve some product changes and some new digital tools and most importantly some education but well do that and we feel like theres an opportunity to do that in the fourth quarter of this year or early first quarter of next year but to your point the fact that it represents about million to million of income where were looking to offset any losses that we have there is in some of the businesses that jamie mentioned earlier where you see our fiduciary business which is growing our brokerage and our securities area as well as our treasury and payment solutions so over time we think the growth in those other larger categories will be able to offset any reductions we have from a new product suite brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it thank you very much for taking my questions i appreciate it kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp thank you operator and the last question will come from steven duong with rbc capital please go ahead synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning everyone andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc just a question on the ci growth in the quarter can you give us some color on what industries or areas where youre seeing that growth and do you expect the acceleration to continue for the end of the year kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp so steven as i mentioned earlier the areas that weve seen some growth from an industry standpoint is the financial services and insurance area weve seen growth in healthcare transportation and logistics retail trade and some construction growth we do expect that to continue for the rest of the year based on our pipelines and based on the discussions were having with our customers ultimately most of the growth that were getting is coming out of our metro markets and i think thats where youre seeing the lions share of activity but were wellpositioned and both in this last quarter you look at just our tier markets our largest market it represented about of our production our tier markets which are still large msas were about and we only had about of our production from our rural smaller market so from those industries ive mentioned as well as our markets like south florida and atlanta and some mediumtier markets like charleston and columbia south carolina greenville we think theres a tremendous opportunity and we think well grow ci strongly in the second half of the year steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great i appreciate the color in that kevin and then just a followup just the commercial loan yields they came in at i guess if you were to strip out the impact of ppp where would that be and if you were to look out one year and the rate environment remains where it is do you expect that to trickle a little lower kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp so yeah look the way i look at that steven is i look at our loans on the books excluding all fees the coupon rate in our portfolio today is about and if you look at our production that we brought on in the second quarter it came on around to so you put it on lets say midpoint of that so there will be continued pressure based on repricing on the new loan origination side as well as renewals that will continue to put pressure on the overall portfolio now the good news is in second quarter those coupons were flat with first quarter so we feel like the price competition that weve been seeing from both large and small banks is starting to normalize and we actually are widening our spread when you look at the credit spread and cost of funds when we look at that new coupon so synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2021 it is going to provide pressure and thats where as jamie mentioned earlier well continue to leverage the liability side to continue to cut our cost there to help to mitigate any impact and keep our margin stabilized steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate the color in that guys operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr kevin blair for any closing remarks thank you kevin s blair president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp thank you
