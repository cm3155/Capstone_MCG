quarter earnings call this last quarter has proven to be a challenging operating environment for the banking industry however once again we have seen the value and viability of main street banks like ours who operate on a relationshipbased client model despite the media narrative that deposit outflows were rampant in regional banks our core deposit balances were up in the first quarter and stable in the month of march a testament to the value of our client base and our team members who serve as trusted advisors in both good and challenging times we have a long and proven track record of success in recent years weve taken a deliberate approach to expanding our business diversifying our client base and leveraging technology and new solutions to improve the client experience and deepen our share of wallet but we have never lost sight of the value of building strong trusted client relationships trust is a twoway street and is often tested during times of stress this last quarter serves as an added proof point of the importance of client loyalty and the engagement of team member base that was instrumental in efficiently executing a multifaceted response to the turbulence in our industry synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 as a result of our team members efforts were pleased to report strong financial results for the first quarter with net income up yearoveryear we also received industrywide recognition including ranking number one for customer satisfaction and trust in the southeast according to jd powers most recent us retail banking satisfaction study and received greenwich excellence and best brand awards for small business and middle market banking while were proud of these results were mindful of the challenges and uncertainties but also the opportunities that lie ahead the recent bank failures and industrywide pressures on liquidity serve as a reminder of the importance of strong deposit production maintaining a strong capital position managing risk carefully and remaining vigilant in an everchanging regulatory environment we increased our core deposit production significantly this quarter but also fortified our liquidity position out of abundance of caution through the addition of broker deposits and fhlb borrowings and we currently maintain over billion in incremental contingent liquidity also we continue to accrete capital consistent with our strategy over the last several quarters finally in the middle of the market upheaval seen in march we kept our eye on the ball and continued to execute our strategic plan in a cost effective manner that provides the maximum value for our shareholders one noteworthy event was the regulatory approval of the qualpay investment which is a supporting component in the delivery of our bankingasaservice platform this quarters results reinforce the strength of our balance sheet with growth in deposits cash balances as well as other contingent sources of liquidity moreover our aoci improved net chargeoffs remained at historically low levels and we grew our tangible book value per share before we transition to the next slide and our financial highlights i would like to thank our entire team for their tireless efforts since early march and thank our clients for the trust you continue to place in us now lets move to slide for the quarterly financial highlights net income available to common shareholders and eps were up and respectively yearoveryear strong earnings growth was supported by year overyear growth in nii and growth from core client fee income this revenue growth combined with year overyear positive operating leverage led to strong performance metrics with roatce of return on average assets of and an efficiency ratio of loans increased million or quarteroverquarter core commercial loans again served as the primary driver of growth offset by runoff of thirdparty consumer loans and a previously disclosed move of thirdparty loans to heldforsale loan growth exthirdpartys move to heldforsale was million or quarterover quarter overall deposits grew quarteroverquarter including growth in core deposits of million core deposits remain stable through the month of march and we saw minimal outflows related to the industry narratives our deposit origination engine remains strong as we once again saw record levels of deposit production despite headwinds associated with noninterestbearing deposit remixing and higher cost associated with core interestbearing deposits deposit rates have tracked reasonably in line with our expectations though current dynamics are presenting some upward pressures relative to our previously guided range our underlying credit performance remains strong and while we are seeing movement away from historically low levels we have not seen a meaningful change in the underlying performance of our borrower base our positive portfolio performance is reflected and continued low levels of chargeoffs as well as our other performance metrics such as delinquencies and nonperforming ratios synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 the acl ratio increased slightly this quarter predominantly due to higher weightings to downside economic scenarios lastly cet1 grew to a result of strong organic capital generation and our decision to continue to retain and grow capital in this uncertain environment now ill turn it over to jamie to continue the overview of our quarterly results in greater detail jamie andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin i might have begun with loan growth as seen on slide total loan balances ended the first quarter at billion reflecting growth of million or million when excluding the previously mentioned move to heldforsale growth was again led by our commercial businesses with cre and ci growth of million and million respectively similar to last quarter cre growth was a function of draws related to existing commitments and low level of payoffs while ci growth was diversified across multiple industries and business lines when examining our ci utilization rate quarteroverquarter the increase is a function of higher utilization associated with newly originated credits rather than an increase from existing customers when looking out over a longer period our increasing ci utilization rate is a function of our changing lending mix which has shifted to larger clients we did not see any meaningful changes in utilization or emergency draws as a result of the recent market disruption we are judiciously originating new credit to serve our core clients and also to gain market share in our most attractive commercial business lines we are also mindful of ensuring new loans are originated at attractive risk adjusted returns as shown through our spreads to index which remain elevated relative to levels overall pipelines and activity remain muted due to lower transaction activity and as kevin will describe later we expect the pace of core loan growth to decline as the year progresses turning to slide core deposit balances grew million quarteroverquarter and we saw continued increase in deposit production with both commercial and consumer business lines contributing to the growth while the current approach to monetary policy continue to be pressure balances and the events of march created uncertainty in the banking environment our relationship banking model proved to be resilient looking at the composition of the quarterly change in balances noninterest bearing deposits were down million quarter overquarter a byproduct of commercial seasonality normal cash deployment and to a lesser extent the continued pressures from the higher rate environment the decline in ma and increase in cds were interrelated as consumers shifted excess liquidity between the two account types our increase in broker deposits was primarily the result of a conservative approach to proactively source additional funding late in the quarter which i will touch on in a moment as we look at deposit rates our average cost of deposits increased basis points in the first quarter to which equates to a cycletodate total deposit beta of approximately through  our deposit cost and betas were impacted by the decline in dda as well as anticipated pricing lags on core interestbearing deposit costs today deposit pricing has generally evolved in a manner consistent with our expectations however recent remixing trends along with an fomc that appears to be biased to hold at or above will likely result and through the cycle betas which track in the low area synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 moving to slide taking a closer look into deposit balance trends within the quarter as kevin mentioned previously our core deposit balances remain relatively stable throughout the month of march however we did take precautionary measures in early march and built up our cash balances through increased use of broker deposits and federal home loan bank borrowings to further augment contingent liquidity sources we continue to proactively pledge additional collateral to the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve and as of april we currently maintain over billion of contingent liquidity across a diverse set of sources which includes immediately available funds as well as funds we expect to be available within short notice and as we flip to slides and you can see we added additional details around the composition of our core deposit base which highlights our relationshipcentric portfolio and which supports the stability we experienced in recent weeks looking through the key characteristics of our deposits you can see both the diversity of our balances across commercial and consumer client types as well as the long tenure of our relationships and given the industry focus around uninsured deposits i would simply highlight that over of our deposits are either insured collateralized or could be insured by switching to an ics account to existing capacity now to slide net interest income was million in the first quarter an increase of versus the like quarter one year ago and a decline of from  the yearoveryear increase was supported by the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet as well as substantial loan growth over the last months when looking at quarteroverquarter nii was negatively impacted by approximately million associated with lower day count the asset side of our balance sheet continued to benefit from both higher balances and rates however as i spoke previously the cyclical lags in deposit pricing combined with the remixing within our nib deposit portfolio served as a notable headwind for the quarter those same dynamics were evident as we look back at the margin for  with higher cash balances also serving to weigh on nim by approximately basis points during the quarter and as the environment has stabilized we are working toward more normalized cash balances and thus the associated impact to nim should reverse in the coming quarters looking forward to  we expect nii to continue to be pressured specifically we will see a full quarter impact of the deposit mix shift that occurred in the first quarter as well as the continued headwind resulting from deposit price lags the combination of these headwinds is expected to lead to nii declines in  followed by relative stability for the remainder of the year consistent with our fullyear guidance slide shows total adjusted noninterest revenue of million up million from the previous quarter and up million yearoveryear this quarters adjusted fee income performance is the highest in recent history even accounting for the elevated mortgage environment we experienced in and the performance speaks to the investments we have made across our franchise with core client fee income excluding mortgage increasing yearoveryear our wealth management franchise grew yearoveryear despite what continues to be a challenging equity market the diversity of our wealth revenue streams including shortterm liquidity management products continues to drive strong growth capital markets also recognized its strongest quarter on record with a revenue of million a increase yearoveryear syndication fees as well as interest rate management products drove the strong quarter further signs that our commercial franchise continues to grow through enhanced product offerings and the expansion of our middle market line of business as we look to the remainder of we do expect core client fee income to decline from  levels as slower economic activity will impact capital markets fees and we also begin to implement changes to our consumer checking products total noninterest revenue for  was impacted by a million onetime benefit associated with the regulatory approval of our qualpay investment synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 moving on to expenses slide highlights total adjusted noninterest expense of million down million from the prior quarter and up million yearoveryear representing a increase as we look quarterover quarter adjusted expenses were wellmanaged increases in seasonal personnel expense and planned increases in fdic and healthcare cost were offset by lower performancerelated expenses and controlled core operating cost when segmenting our yearoveryear increase in expenses the growth is attributable to the three buckets we provided in our guidance for the year first new business initiatives such as maast and cib second core operating expenses including investments in and expansion of our workforce and third costs associated with our fdic assessment rate and healthcare costs our first quarter adjusted efficiency ratio of continues to highlight that these expense increases are supported through our growing revenue base total noninterest expense was negatively impacted by a million loss associated with the move of thirdparty loans to heldfor sale moving to slide on credit quality overall credit performance and the credit quality of our recent originations remain strong the npl ratio moved to net chargeoff ratio to and criticized and classified ratio finished the quarter at of total loans in the first quarter our acl was million or of loans a modest increase of basis points from the fourth quarter the deterioration in the forecasted economic scenarios in and negatively impacted the acl ratio offset by the continuing strong performance of the overall portfolio while we do expect additional pressure on credit metrics due to the economic environment we continue to have confidence in the strength and quality of our portfolio we continue to be vigilant while monitoring the more recession sensitive components of our loan book and we utilize rigorous underwriting parameters and exhaustive market and portfolio analysis not only for these sectors but for the entirety of the loan portfolio given the increased interest in the office sector we have included additional color on our office portfolio in the appendix what you will see is an office book with low maturity and lease rollover risk that is primarily medical secured by modern properties and reflective of our footprint superior market trends as noted on slide the common equity tier ratio increased to within the quarter core earnings supported robust capital generation which was more than sufficient to meet what continue to be solid core balance sheet growth we had no share repurchase activity in the first quarter and in light of the uncertain economic and regulatory environment we believe that continuing to grow our cet1 ratio is prudent as weve done for the last several quarters in the nearterm we will continue to focus on retaining capital generated through earnings to support our core growth while bolstering our balance sheet position while not a metric that we manage to given the current environment it is worth acknowledging the improvement in our tce ratio which increased basis points from  and ended the quarter at declining market rates benefited oci associated with the afs portfolio and hedges and continued growth in our primary capital levels from earnings retention also provided support ill now turn it back over to kevin kevin s blair chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 thanks jamie ill now continue to our updated guidance for the quarter as shown on slide given the ongoing volatility in the economic environment we continue to utilize wider ranges for our full year guidance we expect loan growth of to this reduced range accounts for the acceleration of the rundown in our third party portfolio as well as the diminishing demand associated with the economic environment these effects will be partially offset by low payoff levels and growth from our newer business lines such as cib and expansion in verticals such as commercial middle market the adjusted revenue growth outlook of to aligns with an fomc that reaches in the second quarter changes to the midpoint of our previous guidance are a result of slightly lower loan growth expectations and deposit remixing as well as overall deposit betas which as jamie mentioned are expected to be in the low area our expense outlook has been adjusted downward to to with efforts taken to better align with the new revenue guidance we are prudently managing expenses in this environment while continuing to ensure we do not sacrifice critical investments that will support our longterm success and shareholder value the result of our revised revenue and expense guidance is forecasted ppnr growth of to despite a more challenging environment we are still committed to yearoveryear ppnr growth and generating attractive returns for our shareholders moving to capital as we have previously communicated we are targeting a cet1 ratio above our previous guidance of to at this time we believe it is prudent to build a larger capital buffer given the uncertain regulatory and economic environment i believe the forecast represents the resilience and adaptability of our business model as well as the power of building strong and loyal client relationships our strong financial results this quarter reflect the hard work and dedication of our team as well as our commitment to supporting our clients and communities through these difficult times looking ahead as we see many opportunities for profitable growth and success while continuing to improve our overall risk profile through increased liquidity and capital and wellmanaged credit cost our strategic investments coupled with our clientcentric approach will continue to differentiate us from our competitors and position us for longterm success at the same time as a main street bank we remain committed to being a trusted partner to our clients providing them with the tools and resources they need to achieve their financial goals and now operator lets open the call for qa synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster our first question today comes from brad milsaps from piper sandler brad your line is open please go ahead kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co thanks for taking my questions and for all the detail in the deck maybe i did want to start with credit i appreciate all the details i was curious i know you guys are constantly running sort of internal stress on different pieces of the cre book just kind of curious how thats evolved maybe over the last days kind of given all the transpired also i think and here you note that maybe only about a little less than of the office book rolls over this year would that sort of hold for the rest of the cre book and would just be curious for any color on conversations you are having as these loans matures with borrowers kind of what youre doing to shore them up and just kind of how those conversations are going as we think about credit going forward robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah hi brad this is bob ill comment or two and jamie and kevin can certainly kick in but from a cre from an overall perspective the matchup on the maturity risk if you will is similar in that in terms of youve got some duration there theres probably three years plus for the most part i do want to make sure that i touch on office for you because i know thats what a lot of folks are looking at but just a couple of points number one in addition to the data were showing when you think about office in the spot metrics today theyre very clean average size of that office portfolio loan is less than million little to no chargeoffs and indiscernible low non accruals and even the criticized classified levels today would be in the range now with that said obviously were doing a deep dive into that portfolio weve looked at approximately coverage of loans all loans greater than million and the result of that which gives us sort of a watch list if you will of credits of somewhere around to of the office book that we would have some level of concern about and i would say some level of future concern about these loans are still performing still got good commitment by the sponsors et cetera so when you start narrowing it down its a fairly small quantifiable percentage of the loan book of the office book that we think potentially will need to think through as time goes on now again thats strictly property performance based on potential lease expiration et cetera so from our synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 perspective even when you dig back into the portfolio the potential problems in terms of amounts are fairly manageable so i did want to get that out we arent seeing a whole lot of softness in other asset classes brad multifamily continues to be a good asset class albeit with rent rates certainly beginning to move back but they were so hot for a year or two years theyve got some cushion there and thats market specific warehouse we feel good about as well there and retail seems to be holding fine and the hotel story as we ran through the pandemic there and they seem to be improving so all in all our cre book is in good shape the office story will play out over several quarters but we feel like were well positioned for it kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and brad the one thing i would add to that is bob talked about our internal evaluation but you also have to go back and look at the southeast i mean the southeast continues to perform very well we believe youve seen some distress in certain asset classes but its been very geographical if you look at the southeast we continue to have rent growth higher than the national average when you look at specifically our office portfolio our criticized and classified ratios are far lower than what some others have shared part of that is due to the fact that we have of our book in medical office and the remaining portion of that traditional office book is newer properties in markets that in the southeast havent seen the same work at home impact so in general our update is that although we expect credit metrics to continue to move off of alltime historical lows were not seeing anything systemically including office that gives us greater concerns on the ci front we look at our cash inflows every month and every quarter we havent seen any overall deterioration of any specific industries any npl inflows that weve had at this point have been onesietwosies and so we still remain cautiously optimistic and to your point bob and his team are trying to look at it every different way they can and ring fence anything that gives us any concerns andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah and brad ill just jump in from the allowance perspective and everything bob as bob mentioned weve done a deep dive on all of these portfolios and looked at all loans of any real size and all of that is embedded in our allowance calculation and so as bob mentioned the to the watch list on our nonmedical office that is included in the allowance calculation and what youve seen is on aggregate the quality of the loan portfolio has led to a reduced life of loan loss estimate for the past couple of quarters and so the aggregate portfolio has increased in the first quarter we did increase the allowance based on the cre portfolio by a little less than million and thats embedded in the move from the to the acl ratio brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co got it i guess this is my follow up you guys covered a lot there but you mentioned as you move up in loan size do you also feel like youre moving up sort of in quality of borrower can you just kind of give us a little sense of kind of maybe some of the drivers but behind the loan growth i think you mentioned a couple of times that or seeing maybe larger exposures but certainly in line with as you become a larger bank thats pretty natural just curious on any additional color there robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 yeah so its we talked about it in terms of how we continue to grow our balance sheet actually allows us to de risk the overall balance sheet and its just based on the fact that as were booking more middle market credits as we moved into corporate and investment bank were more investment grade at credits and so when you look at it from expected loss through our provisioning or just through our risk rating process it would suggest that the production that were putting on today and we put on in previous quarters is in effect reducing the overall expected loss of the portfolio moving away from as you suggested some of these smaller credits that have a little more volatility and less cushions of protection and so this quarter our loan growth obviously on the cre front was more of a function of fund ups on our construction lines on multifamily but on the ci side most of the growth came from middle market which was about of the growth which is for us we think right down the middle credits that are going to perform at a very high level so thats been our plan in terms of growth as weve shifted to some of these new specialties and moved up market that not only are we getting good growth but were also derisking the portfolio at the same time brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you guys i appreciate the color kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks brad operator the next question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim your line is open please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess on nii jamie just wanted to follow up on your comment around i guess a decline in and then relative stability in the back half just talk to us in terms of the dynamics that you expect from there around one the pace of deposit repricing if lets say if the fed is done after the may hike like how do you expect deposit costs and betas at what point do they stop rising and remind us of just the asset repricing that you expect back half into next year kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 yeah ebrahim as we look forward we do expect to see continued increases in deposit costs as we kind of get to the end of this tightening cycle when we think about the timing just like what we said in january we do expect the first quarter to be our highest quarterly increase in total deposit cost and when you look at that you can look at the month of december to march where our cost increased basis point but thinking about those monthly increases which we think is probably a better way to look at a little higher frequency data prior to march we saw a steady trend that was right in line with what we had modeled and what we discussed in january we saw monthly deposit cost increasing and those increases peaking in november and december and then in january and february we saw steady declines in the rate of increase of total deposit cost along the lines of what we expected now clearly march was a little bit of a different story when we saw the disruption and so we did see an increase there that was actually kind of similar to what we saw in november and december but the movements that we saw the rollover from yearend into early  gives us confidence in our modeling and our expectations going forward and so we do believe that we will start to see that trend resume from here of slower increases monthly increases in total deposit cost but the march disruption does shift our through the cycle beta higher into the low and so as we look at the second quarter we do expect to see total deposit costs increase a little less than basis points thats left in the first quarter and about a basis point increase from the month of march numbers and so thats what we expect to see in the nearterm then beyond that well continue to see some marginal increase in deposit costs but in the second half the rate of increase declined pretty precipitously on the asset side of the balance sheet in the first quarter you saw our loan beta with a little more than we expect that to continue and as we mentioned in our forecast we expect another basis points from the fed and we would expect somewhere in the low as far as loan beta on that and then progressing through the year we think that the pressures from increased deposit costs and the benefits from fixed rate asset repricing will be fairly well balanced in the second half of the year and then beyond that we think there will be just the benefit of fixed rate asset repricing moving forward which will be a tailwind to both nii and the margin ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you for talking to that and just a separate question so you gave great detail on cre im just wondering maybe bob or kevin anywhere else within just the loan book where youre seeing any signs of stress or pain and as you think about the back half of the year and the cumulative impact from the fed hikes like where do you see the weakness within your loan portfolio where you expect to be drivers of delinquencies and losses robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah ep this is bob ill start nothing specific i wouldnt call out a specific industry or category right now we certainly been watching our small business portfolio as weve mentioned in quarters past and weve seen some marginal negative migration there so we continue to watch that on the ci front no industry specific that i would call out certainly were doing a similar deep dive into our leverage book which is fairly small like we did in our cre book so i dont think were really seeing any specific industries in terms of ci in terms of cre in addition to office obviously multifamily is very market specific weve got a deep market analytics team that that does an awful lot of analysis and thats probably going to be more market specific but we still have a lot of strong economic sort of tailwinds of migration and lack of housing supply particularly in our markets that are still kind of providing a little buoyance to the multifamily book so i dont see it there i think itll be sporadic and dependent upon those companies that are still struggling with input cost and labor cost synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and ep great answer by bob i just its interesting when we look at any of the troubled credits that weve seen in the last several quarters what to me is the only commonality is most of these businesses had challenges prior to the pandemic and in many ways some of the cash around ppp and the ability to manage through the last several years kind of bottom time but as they come out of the other side theyre returning to some tough business models or theyre having some challenges and so instead of new credit issues arising i think what were seeing or some of these companies that struggle in the past that were able to make it with the additional liquidity are back to struggling again that seems like thats a common theme ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator the next question is from steve alexopoulos from jpmorgan steve your line is open please go ahead anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone this is anthony elian on for steve my first question on slide you provided great detail into the composition of the deposit base im curious early on in march what were the conversations like behind the scenes with your largest uninsured depositors after the two bank failures in march was there much concern or panic among these depositors after what they saw happen to svb and signature kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp well tony its hard to understand or gauge what their panic was i think there was a lot of false narratives happening around the industry trying to understand whether this was a bank crisis or whether there were three banks that they had an individual crisis and i dont think that those three banks that failed constitute an overall bank crisis but those conversations led to a lot of calls to our bankers and in many situations our outreach to some of our largest depositors and the conversations were trying to understand how that impacted us and from our standpoint our first goal was to explain that we are very different than the three institutions that failed we have a very diverse granular deposit base as you can see in the deck were not homogeneous as it relates to where we were funding the balance sheet and so having those conversations and most importantly the longterm relationships that weve had with these clients you can see that not only as our average tenure for our top depositor is years but if you look at the entire book the dollarweighted average is years so weve developed longterm relationships built on trust and so when we had those discussions we were able to keep our deposits on balance sheet we do have a product that youve heard about the insured cash sweep product that weve offered prior to this little mini crisis and we had a whopping total of about clients for less than million move into that product so i think that serves as a testament that people didnt feel compelled that they had to move their deposits into that sweep arrangement and that they were very comfortable with synovus continuing to safeguard their liquidity but in many ways there were good fruitful discussions and if i had to gauge how much we lost from that id say less than million in deposits synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats good color and a followup to that i mean on an overall basis do you feel like the situation has stabilized and its back to business now i mean weve seen a handful of regional banks report earnings so far this week and we havent seen the widespread deposit outflows to money center banks or elsewhere that the media or others have portrayed kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah i think the questions around liquidity are abating and the questions around profitability are becoming front and center so what we have to do going forward is make sure that as we continue to grow our asset side of the balance sheet is that were conscious of not just growing deposit but what deposits but also whats the cost of that funding and so thats where were all focused and i think thats where youll see the industry turn their attention and i think youre also seeing more conversations around balance sheet optimization are there asset classes there that are not selffunded that now in this environment with a prolonged higher rate interest rate environment that arent returning the levels of capital the hurdle rates that you require so i think itll turn more to profitability and balance sheet optimization and less about liquidity and concerns of losing liquidity now i will tell you that i think that there as youve heard from other banks theres still a question mark in terms of how much shift will continue to occur from nib and interestbearing and we all can try to model that what were excited about is that we continue to be very successful in our treasury and payment solutions area our production was up again in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last year and i think thats about the best vehicle we have to be able to preserve and grow noninterestbearing deposits and thats where were focused anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you operator the next question is from brady gailey from kbw brady please go ahead your line is open brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys i wanted to kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc start with fee income i heard jamie talk about fees being down on a linked quarter basis in is that based off the reported fee income or is that adjusting for that million onetimer and in fees i know you mentioned synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 some changes in your consumer checking fees so service charges in any way to quantify the impact of that could have on fee income kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah brady the decline that we expect in the second quarter is based on the adjusted number and its really a function of a slowing economy and slower loan growth leading to less capital markets fees the first quarter was a big success for us in capital market fees a record quarter of million thats something that as we head into a likely recession that we dont expect to be sustainable now clearly its a big success because this is an area where weve been investing for some period of time in our commercial businesses and so we love to see that but theres just going to be a headwind on growth in that area just due to the economy and so thats whats largely driving the decline i would put the second quarter nii adjusted in somewhere between ph million and million is probably a good range and thats how we are thinking about that youre right that as we look forward longerterm changes in our deposit offerings will lead to a headwind on nii growth one way to think about that would be approximately million annualized but thats something that the timing is still to be determined and we will give more updates on that as we proceed to the year brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then i know a lot has changed from your investor day last year but i know during that investor day you laid out some targets for of a to roa and a to roatce i think the street has indiscernible closer to a roa next year so any comment or update on how youre thinking about those kind of profitability goals given todays backdrop kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp ill let jamie talk about kind of the numbers brady but ill take you back to that february investor day and when we put those out there we said look these absolute numbers that well share with you are based on todays rates and based on what we see over the next three years and so as of that period those numbers were at were not only accurate for our forecast but they were also accurate and that we felt that they would be top quartile but what we left with that day was look we cant predict the future but what we can say is that our focus is going to be continuing to generate improvements in our financial performance that will allow us to be top quartile if rates are higher and that means that the returns need to be higher and efficiency ratio and need to be lower than so be it but our ultimate goal there was to just say relatively speaking we want to be in the top and the numbers will play out as they play out in that timeframe based on what were dealing with now that may mean that you reset the bar and you look at some different numbers but jamie how would you think about the actual forecast andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah its a very interesting thought exercise because when we laid out our multiyear outlook on february of last year we had fed funds approaching three years out and ironically if you were to look at the forward curve today fed funds is approaching three years out but in a very different way and so as kevin mentioned our performance metrics really are to be top quartile versus peers and we will pivot as we need given the environment and so while the while we may end up back at fed funds in the medium to longerterm we believe that we have a franchise model here thats poised to remain and be top quartile longterm and so we will react to that our priorities right now are ensuring that we are positioned to take care of our clients here in the synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 southeast because we still believe that the opportunity here is unique and big and so we are positioning our balance sheet for that positioning our team for that and we believe that we will win in that regard but were also convicted on making sure that we do it in a prudent manner and defending the balance sheet and you see that in our capital strategy you see it in our liquidity strategies and you see it in our nii sensitivity hedging just making sure that we protect now the income statement and variable in various outlooks and so thats our strategy were committed to longterm top quartile and we will adjust as needed brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah that makes sense thanks guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator the next question comes from michael rose from raymond james michael your line is open please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions just wanted to get a sense for your willingness to maybe actually accelerate some of your hiring efforts and some of the business build outs that you obviously laid out at investor day theres a bank the other day that basically said that hiring opportunities are greater than they could remember in recent times just given that lenders seem to be kind of idle as demand slows and banks kind of pull back just wanted to get an update on maybe some of those initiatives and would you actually consider actually accelerating some of that at the expense of nearterm profits but to position yourselves better on kind of the other side of whatever sort of cycle were going to have thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah michael obviously theres disruption in the marketplace and that presents opportunities and that hasnt changed over the last several years and you can see from our rest of year guidance were continuing to grow expenses and we think that that will given our revenue guidance still allow us to present positive operating leverage but we want to make sure that were opportunistic were leaning in we believe that in times of crisis or in times like this is when share shifts shifts hands and we want to make sure that we take advantage of that and that means that were out there still attracting top talent weve been adding middle market talent we have three additional cib team members that will be joining us in the next several months when theyre finished with their garden leave across our commercial segment were adding talent in our high growth markets and the only thing thats changing there is we want to make sure that were putting a higher bar on the individuals that were hiring and i would love to be able to do just not individuals but to bring over teams but when we look at the payback period of a new relationship manager or a new private wealth advisor we want to make sure that given that there is probably an economic downturn in our near future that we are expecting higher levels of talent and synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 that that npv is not going to be impacted because were bringing in actually better talent and theyre going to perform within our expectations so yes we do think theres an opportunity you wont see us trying to shrink our way to prosperity we think theres a tremendous opportunity in the southeast and we think talents are big piece of that michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc helpful and then maybe just one on the loan growth guidance is the change really just a function of moving the consumer loans to hfs im sorry if i missed that but just wanted to get a sense for kind of what the delta because it does seem like you have good indiscernible kind of momentum utilization rates up kind of et cetera thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp so thats obviously michael thats million we moved over there so thats a component of it but we also have seen softening on the demand side our pipelines are off about when you look at it across the board and thats us being prudent on one side where cre pipelines are off versus last year the growth that were seeing there as i mentioned earlier really fund up some of our construction lines but not a lot of new production so that the pipelines are declining we still think that well be able to grow in that mid singledigit level just because we have so many business units that are fairly new whether its expansion of our middle market team where weve increased our ph rms over the last couple of years our cib which grew another million this past quarter so the difference for us is that on the ci front we have a lot of new initiatives and new talent that will continue to produce despite the fact that overall pipelines are diminishing a bit michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks for taking my questions guys operator the next question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo jared your line is open please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey guys good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe just when we look at the update for higher levels of cet1 and the higher liquidity thats on the balance sheet how long should we be thinking you want to retain higher liquidity and capital i know you said a lot of it is due to the current immediacy of the crisis but should we think that as we go into where more normalized levels of liquidity and that that cet1 ratio could come back down below or do you feel this could be a new normal for a little longer synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp as we think about capital ratios its largely dependent on the environment and so it depends on the stability of the outlook and where the economy is where the banking industry is there are lot of components that are outside of the risk inherent on our balance sheet and so thats how we think about it we think that getting to or higher in the nearterm makes sense and its probably safe to think about that as the next year or so and then were constantly reassessing but thats generally how we think about it and thats not a new strategy for us the last quarter that our deposits that our dollars of cet1 decline was at the third quarter of and since then every quarter we have accreted dollars of cet1 weve accreted billion of cet1 over that time period and weve deployed that to clients in a year in the southeast and so as we think about that strategy its really nothing new for us and thats our intent going forward and we grew cet1 basis points this quarter we expect to continue growing that ratio as we get to the area but longerterm when we look at our stress testing our modeling in a severe adverse scenario theres nothing that points us to the magical number our math would tell us that you could run with a cet1 lower than that and so well assess where we are where the economic outlook where peers are as we go forward but right now were comfortable accreting up to the we think thats the prudent thing to do jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then just as a follow up you mentioned that you used a higher weighting on an more adverse scenario for cecl if you hadnt done that would we have actually seen either dollars of acl decline or ratio decline and i guess what is that weighting to the more adverse scenario now kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah so when you youre right that we did adjust our weightings you can see that in our table on slide the weighting change basically our outlook right now continues to align to that slow growth scenario and its really low to no growth on average for the next couple of years and so thats the basically the base case scenario when you take the weightings consensus baseline would be a positive to the allowance but were really aligned to a slow to no growth scenario for the allowance jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks a lot operator the next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons from da davidson kevin your line is open please go ahead kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co hey guys good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co i just i know weve had a few questions on credit just more general and top level but i just wanted to if this has been addressed already i apologize but there was a linked quarter increase in nonperformers and it looks like also special mention in substandard and im just wondering if theres any kind of common threat to that is that just more whats happening in the environment is it more of a proactive stance i know kevin earlier you mentioned about some of the problem credits or ones that were challenged before and just had some lifelines thrown out from the government now theyre still challenged but just a little more color on any color on what segments are driving that deterioration that we saw then core thanks robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp hey kevin this is bob thanks for the question as far as npls go moved up to basis points its really a handful of credits that we already had rated that kind of moved into nonaccrual status at the same time again i would point to the level of criticized and classified accruing loans behind that is being fairly manageable with no specific industry or concentration if you will geographically speaking to speak off so few credits that were a little bit larger and then you had just normal migration due to the economic environment in sort of our smaller business and consumer book so when you do the math on that throw in the larger ones it pushes you up still basis points about where we were a few quarters back so not significantly higher but certainly migrating up as we had mentioned the bias is still probably for negative migration although is certainly within our expectations in terms of chargeoffs i kind of felt like thats what youre asking as we were going forward those will eventually they will work their way back up to some level of what you may call normalization i tend to think that if you go back prepandemic and we were in the to basis point range if you will that probably feels okay although is certainly subject to quarterly swings particularly if you have some larger credits but all in all thats whats driving the slight increase in those numbers kevin indiscernible kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp perfect bob kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co okay great great thanks one quick follow up just there was a lot of focus a number of weeks ago on underlying losses within held to maturity you guys have been pretty exclusively i think exclusively available for sale and just maybe if you can touch on the tradeoffs in that approach and whether that may whether that could or would change going forward thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp youre right were available for sale as we thought about the use of held to maturity we believe that it really had more negatives than positives where it limits your ability to trade the securities and all you get as a change in the accounting treatment and so theres no economic benefit outside of the appearance of aoci on the balance sheet and in tangible common equity synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 and so we did not choose or elect to put any securities in held to maturity it has been an interesting time over the past quarter as this has become a focus and looking at aoci and comparing the unrealized losses with and without held to maturity for us as we reflect on the use of it we still believe that it is an accounting treatment that doesnt really change anything but it does provide a limitation on your ability to manage your balance sheet and so its not that attractive when it becomes attractive would be if there was a change in the regulatory environment where you had to include aoci in regulatory capital ratios and if that happened and held to maturity securities were excluded from that then that would materially change the view around the benefits of using the held to maturity designation clearly theres no clarity around that what will happen there and how that will play out but thats generally how we think about it but todate were very comfortable with where we are with our securities portfolio were very comfortable with the unrealized losses in that portfolio you saw some improvement quarteronquarter in that and we will await to see if there are any changes on the regulatory side to the treatment of aoci kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co but jamie do you think that given all that attention that was on held to maturity you think theyd ever make that change of doing it for aoci but not for held to maturity andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats beyond me i cant opine on the direction they would go with this to me logically if your view is that you want to look at long duration risk on the balance sheet and you want to focus in on securities then you should probably include everything but i cant opine on what the regulations will be in the future kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and kevin you know this but thats a very surgical way to think about it because nobody is marking the deposit side on the other side of the ledger so when you look at it from an eve perspective you could argue that youre only looking at one component of it and if you marked the liabilities youd be in a very different position kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co that is a very fair point very fair point okay thank you guys kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin operator the next question comes from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott christopher your line is open please go ahead synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks very much kevin i was just going to ask you the same point about marking deposits so thank you for covering that kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp okay christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc my other question was on the fhlb increase was that due to the overall line or did you have to pledge more collateral this quarter andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp that is due to pledging more collateral as weve always felt comfortable with our liquidity profile and contingent liquidity sources but this in the past month there have been new metrics that people that the press and analysts have focused in on like contingent liquidity relative to uninsured deposits and ratios like that and so we spent a lot of time over the past few weeks looking at our loans that were not pledged anywhere and we had almost billion of unpledged loans and so we spent time looking at those data tapes sending them to the online banks sending them to the federal reserve and increasing our contingent liquidity at those locations and clearly that doesnt cost us anything its just an effort of getting loan tapes to those to those places and making that theyre accepted and so that was a little bit of work that we went through over the last month we think thats a prudent thing to do we do not intend to use that capacity but its there for us in a severe adverse or an unexpected situation kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and jamie chris maybe i thought i heard you say the draw we took this quarter was done out of an abundance of caution just to have extra liquidity in case we were to see some outflows and we didnt need extra collateral for that draw we had capacity what jamie was talking about was the incremental capacity that we added during the quarter just to have additional contingent funding available if we needed it christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no that all makes sense and for whatever future episodes occur in the marketplace youre that much more prepared so that makes a lot of sense thank you for all the information today its very helpful kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you chris andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks chris synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 operator the next question comes from samuel varga from ubs samuel your line is open please go ahead samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning sam samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc i wanted to start just one more question on credit with the shift of the part of the consumer book into heldforsale i wanted to ask specifically just on kind of what the thought process was behind that and then conversely i guess are you seeing any sort of underlying trends that made you more cautious on that particular book that you moved robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah ill start and maybe jamie can cover the heldforsale sam this is bob from a credit perspective the move of that was a thirdparty move and just simplistically stated we built that thirdparty book during the excess liquidity period we were in during the pandemic and when we were going the other direction with liquidity so it was viewed as an investment alternative as a surrogate to the investment portfolio and a good yielding move for us on with now taking a whole lot of duration risk and some limited what i would call limited credit risk and now were just kind of exiting that position and again i think validating that there wasnt a whole lot of credit risk there as we took a million charge to make that transfer but from the underlying consumer credit quality and i would include small business loans in that category sam since we do a lot of that through our retail network weve seen moderate migration in credit metrics or moderate deterioration most of our mortgage portfolio is private wealth and position so its holding up fairly well we do have an affordable program that were actually very proud of that we used to support lower income in lmi districts and we have seen some deterioration there but again we think were working with those borrowers have great programs and assistance programs that we provide and proud to do that in our markets actually so overall credit in the consumer books kind of stable with some slight deterioration in small business and jamie on the accounting side andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah as we think about that portfolio that the auto portfolio that we moved to heldforsale thats something we began talking about and i believe in october after third quarter earnings and its a process that weve been proceeding down and we moved it heldforsale and then the month of march happened and theres just more uncertainty out there and so its our intent to sell that portfolio as bob mentioned the credit is performing very well theyre also shorter duration assets and so there are assets that we like we think there is a good profile good risk adjusted return but given the last month i would say that its a little more uncertain out there the environment to sell loans like this but what we will continue to intend to sell it and well continually reassess as we see where the market is on that synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 20apr2023 samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it i appreciate the color and then if i can just have one more in there jamie i appreciate the color you gave on the deposit beta assumptions and how those are moving around i guess what the mix impact on that would you be able to give some specific color on the interestbearing deposit beta andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp as you think about interestbearing deposit beta we were at in the first quarter and as i mentioned the month of march a little bit higher in interestbearing deposit cost i guess due to the cycle interestbearing deposit cost of its the mix is really important when you think about what happens from here as we get later in the cycle but we could see that approach as you get out into the third quarter samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thats very helpful thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah thank you sam operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like
