financial corp thank you kevin good morning everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call before i begin my remarks regarding this quarters earnings i want to take a moment to acknowledge the recent and tragic deaths of our specialty lending division ceo jonathan rosen his assistant lauren harrington his 14yearold daughter ali and alis friend julia all four were killed in a plane crash on october shortly after takeoff from a private airport in atlanta many of you have likely heard us mention jonathans name or may have even met him and youve certainly heard us talk about the extensive impact he has made on our company since we acquired his life insurance premium finance company entaire global one in in addition to exceeding expectations in growing his premium finance division he also oversaw our assetbased lending team and built out a world class structured lending business but as successful as he was in his work he was even more passionate about his family and helping others especially evident through his rosen family foundation that promotes financial empowerment across the socioeconomic spectrum his assistant lauren was equally dedicated to her work and to impacting others as you can imagine our entire work family is dealing with tremendous shock and sadness over this unimaginable loss but jonathan built an amazingly talented team that is doing a remarkable job of carrying on under difficult circumstances jonathan would have wanted it no other way and would have been the first to acknowledge that all of his business success was more of a product of his team rather than himself i am not sure i agree but i am confident in the team he has built to carry his vision forward please join us in keeping the families friends and colleagues of all lost in your thoughts and prayers now lets shift to our third quarter results we are delivering on our growth objectives as evidenced by the period end loans core operating deposits and broadbased fee income growth at the same time we have maintained good expense discipline while continuing to invest in longer term initiatives and have managed through the challenging interest rate environment by strategically investing excess liquidity while continuing to lower the overall cost of deposits loan growth was extremely strong for the quarter as funded commercial loan production increased almost versus the previous quarter which more than offset the ongoing elevated levels of payoffs and paydowns fee income was up million or versus the second quarter with wealth and capital markets income posting strong growth as well as core banking fees returning to more normalized levels postcovid our treasury and payments team set a new high bar in terms of new production at million yeartodate surpassing its fullyear totals during the month of september we also continue to deliver on our synovus forward initiatives which reached the pretax run rate benefit of approximately million by quarter end and were making great progress in planning for the additional million worth of benefits to be delivered by the end of synovus forward represents our ongoing innovation and profitable growth mindset but it will also drive our efficiency efforts in order to ensure we deliver on our sustainable top quartile financial performance objectives on the efficiency front additional branch consolidation is underway with four additional branches scheduled for closure by yearend and we will continue to rationalize the branch network as we reinvent the retail delivery model the efficiency efforts will enhance returns but also allow us to further our investment in specialized talent to build out new businesses and product lines through strategic hires this quarter we have expanded our specialty lending coverage to restaurant services strengthened our middle market florida presence and announced our expansion into the corporate and investment banking segment synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 we continue to make progress on our efforts to digitize our business through the third quarter we have migrated of our clients onto synovus gateway our commercial portal and usage of my synovus our consumer platform indicates that digital usage continues to expand with an additional increase in enrollment and active users moreover a concerted effort has led to a increase in paperless enrollment in we recognized that many of these advancements are table stakes in our industry and therefore we are focusing additional resources on more transformational opportunities efforts are underway to expand our digital engagement through insights we are also expanding the solutions we offer our iso and isv clients and are working on the next generation of fully integrated treasury solutions these and other initiatives are all focused on delivering new sources of revenue in the coming quarters and years ahead our strategic plan forward balances our investments in both core and transformational initiatives in order to generate both short and longterm returns while building on our core differentiation principles now lets take a look at the financials for the quarter on slide weve included some key financial highlights for the quarter id like to begin with loan growth which increased million excluding changes in ppp balances as mentioned previously record levels of funded commercial production drove the growth for the quarter we expect this momentum to carry into the fourth quarter as commercial pipelines remain robust quality deposit growth continued in the third quarter including an increase in core transaction deposits of billion we continue to take advantage of this liquidity environment to focus on remixing our deposit base and along with strategic repricing this has helped lower the overall cost of deposits by an additional basis points to we continue to experience balance augmentation but a core focus on operating accounts has led to dda and now production to increase versus the prior quarter jamie will provide additional details regarding the balance sheet but our goal remains consistent in this environment attracting and deepening core relationships total adjusted revenue of million increased from the prior quarter while adjusted expenses declined million to million this resulted in a increase in adjusted preprovision net revenue quarteronquarter an million reversal of provision for credit losses resulted from the provision expense associated with strong loan growth being more than offset by a reduction in life of loan loss estimates adjusted net income was million or diluted earnings per share as we return to a position of growth we have done so with strong credit liquidity and capital metrics the net chargeoffs ratio declined basis points this quarter to while the npl and npa ratios each fell basis point the acl ratio was down basis points excluding ppp loans ending the quarter at and the cet1 ratio declined basis points to and remained slightly above our stated range at this point ill turn it over to jamie to provide more details on the financials jamie andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin starting with slide we ended the quarter with total assets of billion and loans of billion total loans excluding ppp balances grew million up from the prior quarter led by growth in ci and thirdparty consumer loans ppp balances declined to million in the third quarter we had record commercial loan production however transaction activity remained elevated which led to a million increase in payoffs primarily in the cre portfolio synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 regional economic data as well as client conversations continue to give us a cautiously optimistic outlook on the pace of economic recovery in our footprint we continue to see growth in commitments and are well positioned to increase funded loan balances as market uncertainty and liquidity subsides ci line utilization declined approximately basis points to a return to normalized levels of ci line utilization would result in over million in funded balances the liquidity environment continues to be a headwind to consumer loan demand and resulted in declines in our heloc portfolio of million our third party lending strategy is one means of responding to this liquidity and capital environment providing attractive riskadjusted returns while diversifying the loan portfolio we continue to leverage thirdparty consumer lending to offset consumer loan declines as evidenced by the million increase in thirdparty consumer loans for the third quarter in order to offset continued increase in liquidity we grew the securities portfolio by billion to of total assets at the end of the quarter as evidenced in the appendix a significant portion of the growth was in shortdated securities which mature in less than one year we intend to continue rebuilding the thirdparty consumer loan portfolio to prepandemic levels as long as we secure more assets with attractive riskadjusted returns at the end of the third quarter third party held for investment balances were billion or of total assets growth in this portfolio is predicated on overall balance sheet dynamics including capital liquidity and client loan growth as you can see on slide core transaction deposits increased billion or from the prior quarter core non interest bearing deposit growth of million or was offset by strategic declines in time and brokered deposit portfolios total deposit costs continued to decline with a reduction of basis points to basis points this was primarily driven by deposit mix optimization and strategic reductions in high calls transactional deposits time deposits declined from the prior year accounting for of total deposits compared to a year ago this was led by the reduction in higher call cds while we believe there are additional opportunities for improvement through ongoing product repricing and the continued disciplined balance sheet management it is likely that deposit calls remain relatively stable over the next two quarters as shown on slide net interest income was million an increase of million from the prior quarter the net interest margin was stable with a decline of basis point to we are focused on profitable growth over the long term which includes further optimization of the balance sheet through strategies i just outlined on the previous slides our top priority remains multisolution client growth however we believe there are further opportunities to balance credit duration and liquidity risks we believe that longerterm view in conjunction with strong commercial loan production in our highgrowth southeast footprint can provide outsized nii increases we reiterate our previous guidance that nii excluding ppp will increase in the second half of the year loan growth and the deployment of excess liquidity are expected to offset headwinds from continued fixed rate repricing and the slight reduction in libor we expect ppp revenue to decline between million and million in the fourth quarter the net interest margin continues to be pressured by the liquidity environment while liquidity is generally accretive to nii the impact of cash on the balance sheet and securities portfolio growth are likely to continue to be a nim headwind for the foreseeable future synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 slide shows total adjusted noninterest revenue of million up million from the previous quarter the increase was led by growth of million in capital markets which resulted from swap income and million in loan syndication fees the growth in syndication fees is evidence of why we believe we have opportunities to go upmarket and compete kevin will speak more to this shortly broadbased growth across other nir categories was evidenced by our performance in our treasury group in core banking fees and highlighted by our wealth areas that are up more than yearoveryear in the third quarter we had approximately million in revenue associated with sba loan sales and lowincome housing transactions in the fourth quarter we expect adjusted nir to decline as broadbased growth is more than offset by the continued normalization of mortgage revenues seasonality of our brokerage business and third quarter gains that are not expected to repeat slide highlights total adjusted noninterest expense of million down million from the prior quarter a million reduction in thirdparty processing fees was offset by a million increase in production incentives and additional project spend of million we expect a similar level of adjusted noninterest expense in the fourth quarter with some increases in areas related to increased branch staffing expense as well as revenue in customerfacing projects as we invest for future topline growth key credit metrics on slide remain stable near historical lows the net chargeoff ratio fell basis points to while criticized and classified loans declined the npa and npl ratios were each down basis point past dues were flat at excluding the increase from ppp loans we expect net chargeoffs in the fourth quarter to remain relatively stable and assuming a similar trend in economic improvement a further reduction in the acl ratio which ended the quarter down basis points excluding ppp loans to this quarter the baseline economic outlook improved however due to the economic uncertainty our multiscenario framework included a bias to downside scenarios as noted on slide the cet1 ratio declined basis points to due primarily to capital deployment for growth in our loan and securities portfolios as we continue to actively manage excess liquidity strong financial performance allowed us to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and common shareholder dividends through the end of the third quarter we have completed approximately million of the million share repurchase authorization for the year and we expect to repurchase the remaining million in the fourth quarter we will continue deploying capital to support client growth and facilitate opportunistic inorganic opportunities like thirdparty consumer purchases while returning capital to our shareholders our capital position remains strong and we are wellpositioned to complete key strategic objectives focused on profitable growth prioritizing multi solution client relationships ill now turn it back to kevin kevin s blair president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you jamie on march the federal reserve announced an emergency rate cut of basis points that same day we unveiled details of synovus forward a plan we created in that would deliver an incremental pretax run rate benefit of million by the end of were excited today to share that our efforts to date have yielded approximately million in pretax benefits half of the benefit to date comes from expenses which were frontloaded in the plan to better fund the journey forward synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 as a reminder the most significant items to date have come from organizational efficiencies and head count reductions a reduction in thirdparty spend as well as branch and nonbranch real estate consolidation as a result of these actions as well as demand management our adjusted expenses are down million yearto date or although expense reductions will become a lower percentage of the synovus forward benefits in we will continue to manage with discipline as we expect inflationary pressures especially around wages will impact our overall expense base over the near term one of our ongoing initiatives is branch rationalization we are scheduled to close an additional four branches in the fourth quarter bringing our total consolidation to locations since january we have additional closures planned in as we continue to see the opportunity to optimize the network and do so without having outsized attrition while we rank favorably in key metrics such as deposits per branch and branch proximity we believe our digital efforts as well as the shifting behaviors of our clients provide an opportunity to further streamline our delivery through our bricks and mortar channel and these changes are not limited to branches last month we announced a strategy to optimize our real estate here at our headquarters by selling our own real estate and consolidating our nine corporate and retail locations in uptown columbus into three it allows us to evolve our workplace for the future of work while reducing our overall square footage by over leading to a lower run rate expense and greater flexibility for potential future optimization opportunities as we move forward a key focus on expenses will be on optimizing how and where we invest by delivering ongoing efficiencies in this quickly changing landscape we have and will continue to reallocate resources from infrastructure to innovation and support functions to revenue producing talent our investments will be governed and prioritized by the objective of maintaining long term positive operating leverage which leads to our discussion regarding revenue enhancement within synovus forward much of the future benefits are predicated on the use of analytics to drive a deeper share of wallet enhanced analytics are now firmly in place for our commercial line of business and we have begun development for our consumer lob to complement the hightouch approach that our team members deliver today these more timely and actionable insights promote our ability to offer more meaningful advisory capabilities and solutions and better meet the needs of our clients a significant portion of the incremental revenue benefit in the third quarter relates to our profitability enhancements as well as our balance sheet management efforts similar to our pricing for value initiative within treasury management beginning in the fourth quarter of we began utilizing various analytical tools and capabilities to actively drive deposit cost lower of the 26basis point decline in deposit pricing that occurred over that timeframe our synovus forward initiatives drove additional product and customer level repricing which represented basis points of that decline contributing million in incremental pretax run rate benefit by the end of the quarter additional balance sheet management efforts have largely been centered around increasing the risk adjusted yield of the loan portfolio targeted remixing of a subset of consumer loans throughout has translated into relative higher yields resulting in an incremental pretax run rate benefit of million we remain committed and on track to achieve the cumulative pretax run rate benefit of million by the end of and are confident about the opportunities ahead to achieve those benefits synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 consistent with our reporting to date we will provide more detail on each initiative as they are sized and realized some of the future initiatives are a function of our renewed focus on innovation im excited to provide more details regarding new products and solutions later in the year as we work towards their respective rollout our outlook on slide remains unchanged from the prior quarter however id like to share some additional updates on how we expect to end the year in july we mentioned that we expect that loan growth excluding balance change from ppp and third party consumer loans to be at the low end of the to guidance while pay off activity remains a significant headwind recent productions client conversations and our loan pipeline leads us to expect loan growth to be in the lower half of our guidance although excluded from the guidance its important to note that weve increased thirdparty consumer loans more than billion yeartodate and our total loans at the end of the third quarter were up excluding changes in ppp balances total adjusted revenues are expected at the higher end of the negative to guidance as the balance sheet management efforts weve taken throughout the year to monetize excess liquidity and reduce the cost of funds are being complemented by broad based fee revenue growth outside of the normalization of mortgage revenues similarly total adjusted expenses are expected to end the year within the existing guidance of negative to negative thus providing the opportunity to achieve positive operating leverage we expect to achieve this reduction while making the longer term investments in talent and technology that support accelerated top line growth we also reiterate our capital and tax guidance the capital guidance assumes we complete the full million share repurchase authorization this year and achieve our loan growth targets were also trending towards the lower half of the effective tax rate guidance of to before opening the call for qa let me first thank all of our synovus team members for their third quarter efforts there are so many to mention but i do want to acknowledge our wholesale banking team who generated record levels of loan production our fms and treasury and payment solution teams who generated 25plus percent fee income growth versus and our community bank for continuing to drive strong core deposit growth i also want to reiterate my excitement for our new team members we have onboarded this past quarter and for those that are scheduled to join us in the fourth quarter as i announced in the beginning of the call we will be building out a corporate and investment banking team which will allow us to move upmarket a bit into a segment that i believe we have the capabilities and talent to win in the team will be built around specific industry specialties to allow for customized and expert advice and providing credit and depositary products as well as traditional capital market solutions well share more about the progress in this area as well as other buildouts including our restaurant services division and our expanded florida commercial strategy over the coming quarters lastly im pleased to share that we will be hosting an investor day in early february our first in many years during this event well provide clear longterm guidance with supporting information from our various business units to show where were focused on in driving profitable growth youll hear from more of our leadership team and i believe youll share the confidence that i have that we will be successfully delivering on our key strategic and financial objectives with that ill turn the call over to our operator for the qa portion synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from brad milsaps from piper sandler please go ahead kevin brown a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co good morning kevin just you guys had a nice quarter of loan growth im just curious if you could just add a little bit of color to kind of the nature of the ci growth is it coming from your existing customers or are you going you start to see success with some of your maybe at market upmarket type lending that youre looking to do just kind of wanted to get a sense of kind of where some of the growth is coming from and i know you commented it seems like youre still conservative with your guidance at least through the end of the year but just kind of curious are you encouraged that you can kind of get back to that sort of midsingledigit type rate that youve talked about over the longer term kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp so yeah brad thank you for the question and look yeah were really excited about what the third quarter was able to prove out from a from a growth standpoint we at the top of the house the million worth of growth ex ppp is about annualized but to your point if you back out the third party we still grew our what we would call kind of our core loan million or annualized big piece of that as you mentioned came from ci it was roughly million worth of growth or annualized and it was really across a bunch of different areas not only you mentioned upmarket there was growth in specialty lending but there was also growth in our our core middle market franchise we also saw a tremendous amount of diversified growth across some of the naics codes we had five naics codes that had over million worth of growth including finance and insurance healthcare accommodations and food services construction and manufacturing so it was really really broadbased synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 when you look at the total production total production was up about versus where it was last quarter in just ci at the same time we also saw growth in cre we saw increase in production quarteroverquarter there so as we shared at the beginning of the year we really felt like commercial was going to be the place we had the right to win and where we would grow and we think the third quarter proved that out in terms of being able to maintain that midsingle digit long term yeah weve always felt like we will be able to produce a level of growth that exceeds that of our state gdps the question mark that weve had and it continued this quarter we were just able to overcome it when you look at the level of payoffs that we had at billion in commercial that was about million higher than the ninequarter average so when you look at whats happening from our clients perspective we have a lot of customers who were taking chips off the table because of the perspective change and capital gains as well as cap rates on the cre side being very very low so we believe that well be able to continue the momentum on the production side we think some of these new businesses that were bringing on board will provide some tailwinds on that with the real headwinds being the payoffs that we saw this quarter and we would expect to see those elevated again in the fourth quarter as we close out brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co thank you and as my followup jamie i was curious if you could comment on kind of the impact of greensky selling to goldman on synovus i know a little over a year ago you changed that relationship to where it was less of a balance sheet product for you guys and more one that impact fee income but just kind of curious what it means for the pl going forward presumably if that relationship with synovus no longer exists andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah brad i mean its a great question youre well aware that our relationship with greensky goes back a long ways and its been a great partnership between organizations but also youre aware that our thirdparty portfolio has evolved over time as we look for the right assets that fit our strategic priorities within greensky youve seen the relationship evolve from the hfi strategy to a hfs strategy that actually uniquely helped both companies and so the relationship has been very close were pleased with how weve worked together so we can both achieve our strategic objectives and priorities and were in conversations with greensky as we navigate through their changes and were comfortable we will find an amicable solution i would say its too early to think about what the future state may look like because its just uncertain at the moment but were in conversation with them and we feel good about where we are brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you kevin brown a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp thanks brad synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead kevin brown a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning eb ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch yeah and firstly sincere condolences for the tragedy that you mentioned kevin kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thanks eb just maybe to start out at the very last point in terms of the build out of the i think restaurant finance and you mentioned the corporate investment bank how meaningful are those buildouts going to be as we think about operating leverage over the next few quarters youve been in that adjusted efficiency im just wondering are we on track where over the next course of the next year or two we are moving into the low give us a sense of just maybe the cadence of what that investment spend around building out those businesses likely to look like kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp eb its a really good question because as weve said in previous quarters our focus is getting back to a longterm positive operating leverage environment and for us thats going to be the calibration for how we evaluate how much money were willing to spend on certain investments and so when we look at the corporate and investment banking unit or some of the other buildouts like the restaurant services division or new talent in florida were going to make sure that when we make those investments number one that they have a solid earnback that we look at what that business or product unit would bring to the pl and we want to make sure that its a relatively short payback period two as we build out some of these units and well share that with you we believe that well be able to continue to invest while finding efficiencies in other areas that will allow us to maintain that positive operating leverage so i wouldnt want you to think that were going to go out and build out these new businesses and its going to be a side note as it relates to our overarching goals on the efficiency front now were not in a position today to give you our or efficiency targets but based on the goal of maintaining positive operating leverage you should assume that our goal is to continue to push that efficiency synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 ratio lower despite some of these investments and the way that were laddering many of these investments many will start to produce and that will allow us to start to fund new initiatives and build out the teams at an even greater scale over time but to us it needs to be synergistic to where were not only growing the bank but its helping to fund future growth ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thats helpful and just i guess maybe jamie the thirdparty partnerships you mentioned its about of assets remind us how youre thinking about how large it can get what it was previously when you had both those thirdparty relationships prepandemic and just as a followup on greensky is the only impact lets say if that relationship were to be terminated tied to the heldforsale balances or are there additional pl impacts that we should be thinking about thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim on the third party we are very comfortable with that portfolio being at the same level that it was prepandemic and so if you looked at the percentage of loans we showed percentage of assets in our presentation today but if you look at the percentage of loans it peaked around in the third quarter of it was we were comfortable in that area and theres no magic to the size of that portfolio we feel that we are very capable in managing that portfolio we believe in our partnerships we have long relationships with all of them and feel good about where we are and our knowledge of those loans and so were very comfortable with that portfolio recently youve seen us diversify the risks embedded in that portfolio by looking at collateralized loans as well as shorter duration loans and so we feel good about the opportunities were finding there and it is our intent to continue growing that portfolio as we move forward but we will only do so if the right riskadjusted returns are there with regards to greensky and the future evolution of that portfolio i would just say that the two significant components of that are the hfs strategy and the hfi strategy but its too early to comment around the potential financial impact in the various scenarios that could play out kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp but ebrahim i would just add yeah i just want to make sure you had our held for investment there is now less than million so its a relatively small balance on our outstanding loans on the held for investment side so it has been continuing to diminish over time ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thats helpful and because one of the big synergies that goldman obviously cites is on the funding side so i would assume at some point they want to bring all of that inhouse so thanks for that clarification and thanks for taking my questions kevin brown a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp thank you synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 operator the next question comes from jennifer demba from truist securities please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning kevin brown a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc kevin wondering if you could expand on your comments on going upmarket just kind of talk about what kind of loan sizes youre now willing to do versus previously and if you could talk a little bit about restaurant services and what that team will do kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp so jennifer as it relates to going upmarket outside of the expansion into this corporate investment banking capabilities our wholesale bank has already built out a syndicated finance arm this quarter we had a very large lead arranger fee million on a transaction that we led and so we believe today we already have the capabilities to go upmarket and originate larger loans over million and sell down those loans so that would continue under this corporate and investment banking model we do want to make sure that as we build this out were not going to build a generalized model were going to go after industry specialty in the corporate investment banking space and that will be predicated based on whats available in the marketplace from a talent standpoint but also well align that with those areas that we think were particularly strong in the southeast and with our existing banking franchise to make sure that we leverage that in terms of hold limits we really havent changed our hold limits that will stay the same we generally do not keep credits larger than million and that would not change there our total hold levels would not change its really just well go upmarket for larger customers but be able to sell some of those down on the restaurant services business it was really attracting the team from a superregional bank that has been covering franchise and restaurant businesses nationally it would be full service qsr and the like weve proven out with things like specialty finance senior housing where when we bring in very skilled bankers that have industry expertise were able to grow that business and we think weve been able to do that with the traction of this team that will focus on restaurant services jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay thank you synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 operator the next question comes from michael rose from raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions just wanted to circle back to the revenue guide if i just take the high end it implies about a million decline from the third quarter revenues to get to the adjusted full year guidance and i understand about million of thats going to be declining ppp fees given the million to million stepdown can you just kind of speak to that and what the puts and takes are it just seems conservative andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp so yeah michael its jamie thanks for the question as we look at the revenue guide and outlook for the fourth quarter youre right there are some revenues that happen in the third quarter that will not likely recur in the fourth quarter paycheck protection program being the first as you mentioned we expect that to decline somewhere between million to million in the fourth quarter obviously thats highly uncertain but on the fee revenue side nir was very strong in the third quarter and we saw the same broadbased growth that weve been talking about for quarters and its a really good story however there are a few things that happened in the third quarter that are not likely to recur in the fourth quarter and those include some sales of affordable housing sba sales and then therell also be some seasonal impacts in trust brokerage and mortgage that could be quarteronquarter headwinds so we feel good about our overall revenue guidance for we expect to land at the higher end of that range and we think that were positioned well heading into michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then maybe just going to the margin if i exclude ppp fees it looks like the core margin was down somewhere close to basis points this quarter do you think were getting to a point where the nim is going to start to stabilize particularly as loan growth picks up and the rest of the ppp is forgiven just as we move forward thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah as we look at the margin i mean there are obvious headwinds as we move forward just to the headline margin i know you excluded ppp which we do as well but that decline in ppp fee recognition in the fourth quarter will impact the headline margin fairly significantly in the fourth quarter but when you exclude the paycheck protection program you have a couple crosscurrents so first is current rates are a slight headwind to both nii and the margin given current shortterm and longterm rates but the liquidity environment is a notable nim headwind that were working against as we try to deploy our liquidity in our balance sheet our outlook for the margin in general remains in the same context we discussed last quarter with a medium term margin in the area but we had highlighted that the nim outlook is very dependent on that future deposit growth that deposit growth that incremental liquidity is generally accretive to nii but that increased cash on the balance sheet or even if we deploy it to the securities portfolio is nondilutive so we feel good about our core nii synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 outlook we believe it points to steady growth as liquidity is deployed in the client loans third party and securities that should off more than offset the rate headwinds at current levels but we do acknowledge that the liquidity environment can impact the margin pretty significantly michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful thanks for taking my question kevin brown a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp thank you michael operator the next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead kevin brown a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp good morning anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning this is anthony elian on for steve my first question on loan growth on slide you show that commercial loan payoffs were about billion in the third quarter give a sense of how much of these payoffs are refinancing and staying with synovus in the funded production bucket as opposed to the funded bucket representing brand new loans to the bank kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp tony none of those would have been refinanced out so those are total payoffs so they would have exited the balance sheet anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so the blue bar of little more than billion represent entirely new production to the bank kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thats right those are new loans new originations funded loans and then on the other bar that represents payoffs and as i said earlier that billion in commercial payoffs it was over the last nine quarters that averaged only about billion so weve seen elevation there but when you look at the production side that billion worth of funded production new loans is actually up versus the previous quarter so despite the fact that we did see elevated payoffs we were able to overcome that by seeing a much higher increase in production anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 okay great and then my followup so you got the loan growth outlook unchanged at the lowend or the low half of to ex ppp and ex third party consumer which if i just do the math it would imply a little bit of a slowdown in terms of dollars of growth in the fourth quarter anything particular youre seeing that could lead to loan growth decelerating or is this just a little bit of conservatism baked in here thank you kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp tony its a its a good question its like were looking at a crystal ball and trying to look at all the elements our pipelines remain robust theyre still up over where they were entering the year theyre down a little bit from the from the beginning of the third quarter just because we had such strong production so were very confident in the production side of the equation whats the challenge is on these payoffs as we close out knowing that theres a potential for a change in tax treatment were cognizant that there could be elevated activity this quarter that would result in even higher pay off activity now we dont have anything at this point that would show that thats the case but we want to make sure that as we look into the fourth quarter we evaluate that as a potential so thats our guidance last quarter was that we would be at the lowend of the range we suddenly said in our guidance this quarter that we would be above the lowend of the range so we could move more towards the median but it really will be function of what that pay off activity is not our productivity anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator the next question comes from steven duong from rbc please go ahead kevin brown a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp good morning steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning steve steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc so just a question on your margin i guess your interest rate sensitivity table from last quarter theres a gradual parallel 100basis point rise in rates your nii goes up by can you share with us the deposit beta assumptions that you put into that in terms of whether they were fully loaded on the first rate hike or if they were graduated up through that fourth quarter period synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah as we think about deposit betas in this environment we expect that deposit betas will be very low fairly de minimis for the first few rate hikes beyond that we would expect to see something in the area of about a beta as rates go higher from there steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so is that in your interest rate sensitivity on the second quarter kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yes steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it and then just my followup is just on your expenses you guys are doing a great job managing the expenses are you seeing any signs of wage pressure popping up as you try to manage these expenses kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp steve thats a new headwind obviously everybody sees whats happening with the labor force and potential inflation around wages were seeing that as well predominantly in our entry level positions in those folks that make below the median wage here at synovus which is right around we did in the third quarter make an adjustment to all of those individuals to give a cost of living adjustment just based on that but i think as were looking at hiring in new talent we see the cost rising across the board and i think thats just something that whether its the financial services industry or any other industry i think its just part of the equation and its part of what makes it important to build a place that people want to work when you look at our attrition this year annualized were still at about in total attrition if you compare that back to we were roughly at so although weve seen an increase in attrition its not at the levels that some of our peers are experiencing from some of the benchmarks ive seen so i think for us part of it is going to be to compete from a wage standpoint but as we all know theres more to a job than just what you earn and so were trying to make sure that we drive better levels of engagement through development career development to make sure that were offering perks outside of wages but ultimately we agree that youre going to see some inflationary pressure on wages as we move forward steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great i appreciate that and right now its just occurring at the entry level it hasnt permeated much further up is that correct kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp i think its more pronounced at the entry level just because you have higher turnover there so youre seeing the new wages come on whats changing i think for all companies is the ability to work remote has widened peoples synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 sandbox so that they can get a job working in new york out of atlanta georgia or columbus georgia and so that in and of itself increases potential the cost of employment just because theres new entrants into the marketplace to be able to compete for that talent so i think youre going to see it across the spectrum where weve seen it today just because of a higher level of attrition has been on those entry level positions steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great i appreciate the color thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hey steven let me jump in this is jamie on that deposit beta the beta we have in there is for as rates go up the that we had is more ph through the cycle steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it appreciate it thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yes operator the next question comes from brody preston from stephens inc please go ahead brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brody brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey jamie just on the expense guidance you gave color around the revenue guide that you expect to be towards the higher end of the guidance on the expenses you all are trending towards the better end of that guidance yeartodate and so as i think about the fourth quarter run rate just given some of the fee income items that might not reoccur and maybe its another slower mortgage quarter is there any reason to think that expenses should inflect higher in the fourth quarter or should we continue on sort of a downward trajectory here andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah we believe that expenses in the fourth quarter will likely be relatively stable to the third quarter there are some typical inflationary pressures on nie but we also have and we also have incremental spend for growth and so we have those we have some tailwinds that come through on some of our synovus forward initiatives synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 and so as we balance all of those out looking in the fourth quarter we expect nie to be relatively relatively stable to the third quarter brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then my followup is a little bit of a multipart question here just around liquidity deployment you guys put a decent chunk of liquidity to work and so i guess i wanted to ask two questions as it relates to the securities portfolio one it looked like that was maybe weighted towards the back half of the quarter kind of comparing the average balance in the period end a little bit one is that the case and then two the security yield stabilized and so whats the kind of incremental yield that youre putting on the book currently kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah good question then and youre right generally about the timing and going on yields are really really in the context of portfolio yields so our book yield on the portfolio in the third quarter was our going on yields are on a similar context between and but you can also see that we our strategy in the securities portfolio evolved a little bit in the third quarter and we have about million of investments that are maturities less than one year and so were trying to kind of opportunist opportunistically deploy that liquidity in the securities book in areas that dont have as much duration risk as a conventional mortgage and so thats one of the strategies that were currently deploying brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it thank you very much for taking my questions kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah kevin brown a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp thank you brody operator the next question comes from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning kevin i also echo condolences for jonathans loss and all related parties i wanted to ask about your digital evolution at synovus and it seems that a lot has happened in the last couple of months and im just curious if you would make this a baseball game what innings do you think you are compared to where you really want to be in the future innings kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 the baseball analogy chris is hard because i think unfortunately this is a game that doesnt play in a nine inning framework i think its something that this game goes on forever it may be one of the ones where thats a timeless game kind of like maybe some of these cricket games that go on for days but the reality is we made great progress we focused on starting with our consumer platform my synovus to enhance that several years ago we rolled it out and if you look at the apple store rating today on our app its which is one of the highest in the industry and i think thats a testament to our digital team and our consumer team working to make sure that the functionality and capabilities we have within that platform meets the needs of our customers and its agile and pliable so we can continue to add new functionality over time and i think you see that with our digital enrollment adding zelle to the functionality last year moving more people to paperless all of the things that you want to see in the digital platform our focus on the consumer side really is about taking the online account origination to the next level weve been very successful in the mortgage front originating more than of our mortgages via our digital application were seeing more traction on the depository side and now were working more towards the consumer lending platform so i would tell you that if youre looking at the area were most focused on its the online account origination enhancing that capability and making it even easier and faster for our customers to apply for our products on the commercial side were excited about the synovus gateway platform as weve shared weve migrated about of our customers over to the platform we have one additional wave in the first quarter of next year and we think that platform in and of itself is going to create a better user experience and its going to allow us to continue to add new products and functionality that our customers not only need but will allow them to reduce their back office expense well be able to automate many of the functions that theyre doing so were excited about that as i think you look in the future on commercial its more about products and solutions and making sure that we continue to add there so digital for us will continue to be a part of our ongoing roadmap i think youll start to switch from service into more of a sales capability we noted on the prepared remarks that adding insights both on our commercial side which weve already done were moving towards that insightdriven model on the consumer side that will allow our bankers to offer advice more frequently and will allow the technology to queue up our customers for exciting offers or opportunities to improve their financial wellbeing so theres a lot of work to go here but i think we feel like we have the right focus and we have the right resources that will continue to drive ongoing investment christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no thats great i appreciate all the background there and i guess in addition to the positive operating leverage that you and jamie both talked about this morning is it fair that the per transaction cost for synovus is going to be a lot different in future years than what weve seen in the past kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp absolutely i mean we talk about internally radically automating our platforms to make it not only to cut the cycle times but to reduce the expense in addition when you think about the cost associated with our bricks and mortar well continue to consolidate that network and have the opportunity to reduce that cost of operations and ultimately then reduce our cost to serve but that has to be a key component of positive operating leverage you wont do it just from asset sensitivity you wont do it through balance augmentation youre going to have to do it by growing your business which is a keen focus of ours but at the same time cutting your cost to serve synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks again for the time this morning kevin brown a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp thank you chris operator the next question comes from brady gailey from kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys kevin brown a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to start with the reserve you came into this year with a reserve of a little over basis points and as credit has improved and fears of covid have gone away its now down about basis points assuming credit continues to hold in and get better from here how much further down do you think that reserve can release to kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah its a great question as you look at our credit metrics you can see that were not seeing credit deterioration in our loan portfolio so we feel really good about where we are and what we have line of sight into on the credit side is strong and when you look at the employment outlook overall for next year for our base outlook continues to improve however we do believe that the uncertainty in the economic outlook remains elevated and we quantify that as a higher weighting to downside scenarios we have that at this quarter and that impacts the allowance and so when you look at just the base case scenario over the past few quarters weve seen a sequential improvement in life of loan losses in that scenario however we do use a multiscenario framework and downside scenarios kind of they remain as severe as they were in the past and so that weighting impacts the rate of improvement of your allowance to loan ratio so thats kind of whats been driving the decline and why the decline is maybe different than what youre seeing elsewhere but we do believe that our day allowance is indicative of where we should return in a more normalized economic outlook assuming that the loan mix remains the same synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 and so we are seeing loan mix evolve and that could result in even better than day allowance to loan ratio but those are the main puts and takes i mean theres nothing that we see today thats concerning to us on the credit side our base case scenario continues to show improvement and we if we can reduce the uncertainty in the outlook we believe that thatll drive further allowance to loan ratio improvement brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and jamie remind us where was the day ratio andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then my followup i wanted to ask just about share buybacks not necessarily for the fourth quarter i think we know what you guys are going to do there but as you look longer term in the past several years you guys have been pretty active in the buyback but growth feels like its inflecting for the industry it sure looks like its inflecting for you all in the third quarter with the uptick when you look longer term as growth kicks in does the buyback take a backseat to that and should we expect a lesser amount of buybacks longer term just with you guys focusing more on deploying that capital to growth which i know is your preference kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp well youre youre exactly right on that being the preference and our strategic priority i feel like over the course of weve all been scanning the horizon with our binoculars looking for growth in the third quarter we feel good about how the team performed and what we delivered and so thats our priority and thats our target for deploying that excess capital generated through earnings but when we look at longer term we will continue to target kind of the to dividend payout ratio and then beyond that it really is balanced between risk adjusted returns on growth on core client growth as well as third party and share repurchases and so our intent is to deploy as much of that capital as possible to our clients and so well see if this momentum continues we believe it will but thats our intent for today brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks guys kevin brown a senior directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp thank you brady operator this concludes our questionandanswer session id like to turn the conference back over to mr kevin blair

competitive more efficient and valuable to our clients prospects and our stakeholders we look forward to these future opportunities and i continue to tell our story and deliver on our commitments but if you allow me i wanted to end todays call with one of the guiding principles that jonathan rosen created for his global one business as i believe its a fitting way to conclude our call and also to
