reporting see part ii item financial statements and supplementary data note segment reporting of this report competition the financial services industry is highly competitive and could become more competitive as a result of recent and ongoing legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation within the financial services industry synovus bank and our whollyowned nonbank subsidiaries compete actively with national and state banks savings and loan associations and credit unions and other nonbank financial intermediaries including securities brokers and dealers investment advisory firms mortgage companies insurance companies trust companies finance companies leasing companies and certain governmental agencies all of which actively engage in marketing various types of loans deposit accounts and other financial services in addition competition from nontraditional banking institutions often known as fintech continues to increase with consumers having the opportunity to select from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives the ability of such nonbanking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition because nonbanking financial institutions are not subject to many of the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures these competitors have been successful in developing products that are in direct competition with or are alternatives to the banking services offered by traditional banking institutions our ability to deliver strong financial performance will depend in part on our ability to expand the scope of and effectively deliver products and services which will allow us to meet the changing needs of our customers however we often compete with much larger national and regional banks that have more resources than we do to deliver new products and services and introduce new technology to enhance the customer experience see part i item risk factors competition in the financial services industry may adversely affect our future earnings and growth as of

and separately the fdic as the insurer of bank deposits have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions on our part if they determine that we have insufficient capital or other resources or

into informal or formal supervisory agreements including board resolutions memoranda of understanding written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders pursuant to which we would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions if we become subject to and are unable to comply with the terms of any future regulatory

activity limitations as a financial holding company we are permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bank holding company that has not elected to be a financial holding company bank holding companies are generally restricted to engaging in the business of banking managing or controlling banks and certain other activities determined by the federal reserve to be closely related to banking financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are considered to be financial in nature as well as those incidental or if determined by the federal reserve complementary to financial activities we and synovus bank must each remain wellcapitalized and wellmanaged and synovus bank must receive a cra rating of at least satisfactory at its most recent examination in order for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company if synovus bank ceases to be well capitalized or well managed under applicable regulatory standards or if synovus bank receives a rating of less than satisfactory under the cra the federal reserve board may among other things place limitations on our ability to conduct these broader financial activities or if the deficiencies persist require us to divest the banking subsidiary or the businesses engaged in activities permissible only for financial holding companies in addition the federal reserve has the power to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any nonbanking activity or terminate its ownership or control of any nonbank subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company as further described below each of the company and synovus bank is wellcapitalized under applicable regulatory standards as of december and synovus bank has an overall rating of satisfactory in its most recent cra evaluation source of strength obligations a financial holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank the term source of financial strength means the ability of a company such as us that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution such as synovus bank to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of financial distress the appropriate federal banking agency for the depository institution in the case of synovus bank this agency is the federal reserve may require reports from us to assess our ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the source of strength requirements by requiring us to provide financial assistance to synovus bank in the event of financial distress if we were to enter bankruptcy or become subject to the orderly liquidation process established by the doddfrank act any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of synovus bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee or the fdic as appropriate and entitled to a priority of payment in addition the fdic provides that any insured depository institution generally will be liable for any loss incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of or any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled insured depository institution synovus bank is an fdicinsured depository institution and thus subject to these requirements acquisitions the bhc act permits acquisitions of banks by bank holding companies such that we and any other bank holding company whether located in georgia or elsewhere may acquire a bank located in any other state subject to certain depositpercentage age of bank charter requirements and other restrictions the bhc act requires that a bank holding company obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before i acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any additional bank or bank holding company ii taking any action that causes an additional bank or bank holding company to become a subsidiary of the bank holding company or iii merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company the federal reserve may not approve any such transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the united states or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources of the companies involved including pro forma capital ratios the risk to the stability of the united states banking or financial system the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including performance under the cra and the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering change in control federal law restricts the amount of voting stock of a bank holding company or a bank that a person may acquire without the prior approval of banking regulators under the federal change in bank control act and the regulations thereunder a person or group must give advance notice to the federal reserve before acquiring control of any bank holding company such as the company or before acquiring control of any state member bank such as synovus bank upon receipt of such notice the federal reserve may approve or disapprove the acquisition the change in bank control act creates a rebuttable presumption of control if a member or group acquires a certain percentage or more of a bank holding companys or banks voting stock as a result a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the federal reserve before acquiring the power to vote or more of our outstanding common stock the overall effect of such laws is to make it more difficult to acquire a bank holding company and a bank by tender offer or similar means than it might be to acquire control of another type of corporation consequently shareholders of the company may be less likely to benefit from the rapid increases in stock prices that may result from tender offers or similar efforts to acquire control of other companies investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares of our stock governance and financial reporting obligations we are required
