that our thoughts and prayers are with all of those impacted both directly and indirectly by the covid19 virus this has been a difficult time for all of us and we certainly hope you and all your families are doing well the financial services industry has certainly had its ups and downs replicationally over the many years but i can tell you today im proud of our industry even though this pandemic time where we are focused on getting associates at home we help keep the markets opened the industry has helped with the administrative the administration of government programs and helping businesses and people get much needed cash we have shared best practices on protecting employees and associates and everyone connected to the crisis was just trying to help during this national emergency and furthermore i think the government especially the treasury and the federal reserve has been unbelievable at being open to support the markets in this very difficult time and to reach out to make sure that the programs really worked values are critical during good times but they are the guiding light in terms of any crisis as we navigated through this crisis our top priority was clear the health and safety of our associates and advisors and as well as our clients we have created and followed every case in rj family to make sure that our associates and their families were well equipped to handle the impact we quickly transitioned nearly of our associates to working remotely and closed all employee branches while providing continues service to our clients weve also taken the additional steps to support our associates particularly those who are directly impacted by covid19 with working days of additional sick time zero cost for telemedicine options for financial relief and resources for emotional and the mental health of our associates some dealing with the stress of and some just the stress and challenges of the home environment with working from home while kids were telecommuting to school in addition to ensuring for the health and safety of our associates another priority is to maintain the continuous service to support the clients during these challenging times during the quarter we experienced unprecedented levels of client activity for example our top trading days ever all occurred in march we saw retail orders more than double transaction volumes more than triple and institution volumes up times on some days our ability to provide continuous service to our advisors and clients without any significant disruptions is a testament to the investments we made in our technology and mobile apps over the last years just as important even during these indiscernible and challenging conditions our committed and experienced support teams demonstrated our longstanding service firm spirit in supporting advisors and clients even in a work at home environment and true to our mission of raymond james we continued supporting our communities in the us canada uk during these challenging times in fact the commitments from our companies and executives have surpassed million that help relief for those that are in need and we anticipate doing more our associates over the same period of time have personally stepped up to support their communities i expected no less we are also supporting our communities through food and supply donations to aid local food banks and raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 clinics in our markets again i cannot stress how proud i am of our raymond james associates and advisors who are quickly transitioning to our business continuity protocols and continued providing excellent service to clients moving to slide despite a tumultuous quarter our second quarter financial performance reflecting a relative resiliency of our diversified and clientsfocused business model we generated record quarterly net revenue of billion which was up over prior years fiscal second quarter and over the preceding quarter the growth in net revenues was primarily attributable at the beginning of the quarter with record pcg assets and feebased accounts as well as higher brokerage revenue due to the surge in market volatility in march we generated quarterly net income of million or per diluted share which was down compared to the net income into the prior years fiscal second quarter and compared to the preceding quarter the significant decline in quarterly net income was largely caused by the million bank loan loss provision and valuation losses and our private equity investments on an annualized basis our return on equity for the quarter was and return on our tangible common equity or rotce was moving to slide the significant declines in the equity markets in march resulted in a decrease of client assets and led to clients shifting assets to cash driving the client cash balances to surge sequentially to a new record of billion and despite disruption in march due to the nationwide shelterinplace orders we reached a record number of private client financial advisors of a net increase of over march and over december these net additions of financial advisors is a function of strong retention and recruiting results and we really only had two full months in normal recruiting activity before the pandemic hit net loans reached billion up over the prior years fiscal second quarter and over the preceding quarter the growth in the banks loans was largely attributable to about million of corporate revolver fundings and continued growth in residential mortgage the pcg clients now on the segment results starting on slide the private client group generated record quarterly net revenues of billion primarily driven by higher asset management fees as these fees are billed on balances at the beginning of the quarter and higher brokerage revenues as trading volumes spiked in march growth of asset management and brokerage revenue was partially offset by the negative impact of lower shortterm interest rates open rjbdp fees and from thirdparty banks and net interest income record quarterly pretax income for the segment was million up yearoveryear basis and sequentially on the bottom of the slide while client assets declined along with equity markets you can see we continued our consistent trend of growing the number of financial advisors which has become increasingly rare in our industry in fact over the last four quarters financial advisors representing over million of trailing months production approximate billion of assets where prior firms have affiliated with raymond james which is a spectacular result moving to slide revenue in the capital markets segment primarily due to higher equity and fixed income brokerage revenues in march as well as equity underwriting revenues during the quarter despite the higher revenues the segments pretax income declined largely due to losses on trading inventories during the quarter as there was a significant yearoveryear decline in ma revenues compared to the very strong results in the prior years fiscal second quarter on the next slide the asset management segment generated net revenue of million and pretax income of million during the quarter both flat with the record levels achieved in the preceding quarter results in this segment reflected a portion of a steep decline in the equity markets in march as financial assets under management are build based on a combination of balances of beginning the quarter balances at the end of the raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 quarter and average balances during the quarter financial assets under management fell to billion decreases of on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially primarily attributable to decline in equity markets as the sp index declined during the quarter as well as net outflows for carillon tower advisers on slide raymond james bank generated net revenues of million a decline from the preceding quarter despite continued asset growth largely attributable to a basis points decline in the banks net interest margin during the quarter reflecting the shortterm interest rates as the federal reserve slashed interest rates to close to zero in the month of march we expect continued nim pressures paul shoukry will detail a little later pretax income of million declined to both prior years fiscal second quarter and the preceding quarter primarily due to higher bank loan loss provision which is a good segue into the next slide slide provides the history of raymond james bank key credit metrics since the financial crisis you can see that raymond james bank consistent with the banking industry has enjoyed several years of positive credit trends since the financial crisis in the second quarter the loan portfolio continued to perform well as indicated by the low level of nonperforming assets which actually decreased due to a corporate loan payoff earlier in the quarter there were also no net chargeoffs during the quarter but as the covid19 crisis cause economic conditions to rapidly deteriorate at a really unprecedented piece of scale we increase the allowance for loan loss reserves resulting in the banks loan loss provision of million for the quarter as a result the loan loss allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans increased to from the preceding quarter you can see our allowance for loan losses peaked at around in fiscal while our portfolio is much more diversified now which paul will discuss later in the call were also in an unprecedented economic environment so theres simply too much uncertainty to know how much credit deterioration will be caused by covid19 however if economic conditions continue to deteriorate we do anticipate continuing to add to our allowance for loan losses looking at the fiscal yeartodate results on slide we generated record net revenue of billion during the first half of fiscal up over the first half of fiscal notably all four core operating segments generated record net revenues during the first six months of the fiscal year earnings per diluted share of declined compared to the first half of again primarily due to the banks loan loss provisions i will give an outlook at the end of this call but for now im going to turn it over to paul shoukry for a more detailed review of the financial results paul paul shoukry chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thanks paul and im being told that pauls opening for a few minutes was missed because the operator forgot to switch us over to the overall line so maybe ill ask paul to repeat his industry remarks in the outlook starting with revenues on slide as paul stated we generated record quarterly net revenues of billion which were up on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially asset management fees were up on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially pcg assets and feebased accounts declined during the fiscal second quarter which will be reflected in the third quarter as these assets are billed at the beginning of each quarter based on balances at the end of the preceding quarter raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 brokerage revenues during the quarter of million were strong as there was a surge in trading activity in both private client group and the capital markets segment in march account and service fees of million declined on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially primarily reflecting the decrease in rjbdp fees from thirdparty payments due to lower shortterm interest rates paul already discussed investment banking results and ill discuss net interest income on the next two slides but quickly on other revenues which were down substantially this quarter reflecting valuation losses associated with our private equity investments in the fiscal second quarter of million and as youll see on the upcoming expense details slide million of the valuation loss is attributable to non controlling interest and is presented as an offset in other expense so the net impact of pretax income of the valuation losses associated with the private equity investments was million for the quarter representing close to a decline in those valuations the remaining value of these legacy private equity investments that is attributable to raymond james was around million as of march moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep balances which are the primary source of funding for our interest earning assets and the balances with thirdparty banks that generate rjbdp fees ended the quarter at a record billion representing domestic pcg client assets as market volatility and the steep declines in the equity markets in march led to clients shifting assets to cash other than quarterly fee payments these balances have remained relatively resilient thus far in april however we have shifted about ph million of these cash balances from raymond james bank to thirdparty banks since the end of the quarter the surging cash balances in march highlight the advantages of our multibank sweep program which offers up to million of fdic capacity to clients while also providing the firm significant flexibility to move the balances on or off balance sheet as appropriate on slide the top chart displays our firmwide net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks on a combined basis as these two items are directly impacted by changes in shortterm interest rates as you can see the rate cuts totaling basis points since august have put significant pressure on these revenue streams which on a combined basis are down million compared to the prior years fiscal second quarter despite loan growth at raymond james bank and the surging cash balances this quarter on the bottom of the slide it shows our banks nim decreasing to this quarter but as you all know the last basis points of cuts occurred in march so we will continue to experience nim compression in the fiscal third quarter we would expect the base nim to decline to somewhere around over the next quarter or two depending on where libor settles out on the bottom right portion of the slide you can see that the average yield on rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks fell to an average of during the quarter but again given the timing of the rate cuts in march we would expect this yield to decline further to around basis points starting in the fiscal third quarter and while these balances ended the quarter at billion weve shifted a significant amount of balances from raymond james bank in april where they were earning about basis points of the federal reserve or roughly basis points net of fdic insurance premium so theres currently approximately ph million of balances with third party banks reflecting the ph million shifted from raymond james bank in the fiscal third quarter since the fiscal third quarter and net of the outflows related to quarterly billings in april now ill discuss expenses on slide first compensation expense which is by far our largest expense the compensation ratio increased sequentially from to during the quarter the compensation ratio was negatively impacted by lower noncompensable revenues in the private client group primarily due to lower short raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 term interest rates losses on trading inventories and the aforementioned valuation losses on private equity investments the private equity valuation losses reduced net revenues by million and had a negative impact of over basis points to the total compensation ratio as there is no direct compensation associated with private equity valuation adjustments so if you look at the million sequential increase in total compensation the vast vast majority of it is attributable to direct payouts to financial advisors and the private client group and direct pay off from the higher brokerage revenues in capital markets segment on to noncompensation expenses noncompensation expenses during the quarter were million increased substantially due primarily to the large loan loss provision of million in the quarter as for the loan loss provision i just want to remind you all that due to our fiscal yearend on september we do not implement cecl until october of this year so the provisions this quarter really reflect our intent of downgrading credits and taking more allowances for the loans that are most directly exposed to the covid19 crisis as i noted earlier other expense included a million offset related to the noncontrolling interest of the valuation losses on the private equity investments excluding that npi offset other expenses would have been higher during the quarter largely due to legal reserves in the private client group segment but almost all the other expense categories came in close to where we expected while there were some elevated expenses associated with buying laptops for the relatively small portion of our associates we still had desktops an increase in bandwidth and licenses to facilitate remote working arrangements there are also offsets from lower travel costs in march due to covid19 we expect those travel expenses the conference expenses as those have been canceled over the next several months to remain lower than normal over the nearterm most of those expenses show up as business development expenses on the pl so really i think there may have been some confusion on a few of the reports last night about our expenses being higher than expected the compensation was higher due to higher revenues than the street anticipated and the compensation ratio was negatively impacted by over basis points by the private equity valuation losses and the noncompensation expenses of million were higher than that million we guided to last quarter solely due to the million loan loss reserve slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters pretax margin was in the fiscal second quarter of negatively impacted by the large bank loan loss provision and lower shortterm interest rates on the last call we established a target of for the compensation ratio about million per quarter for noncompensation expenses and for the pretax margin but those targets are no longer valid given the significant changes in the market environment nearzero shortterm interest rate and the higher bank loan loss provisions due to covid19 assuming we have some market clarity by june we will aim to provide new targets then and at our upcoming analyst investor day which we now plan on holding virtually we will let you know as soon as we finalize the date but we may postpone it if there is still too much market uncertainty to provide updated targets on slide at the end of the fiscal second quarter total assets were nearly billion growing sequentially this significant increase was largely attributable to the surge in client cash balances about billion of which were deposited at raymond james bank the significant balance sheet growth caused the tier leverage ratio to decline to which is still well well above the regulatory requirements and as i mentioned earlier in april we already shifted approximately ph million of the cash balances off of raymond james banks balance sheet to thirdparty banks reducing the size of the balance sheet which will have a positive impact on the tier leverage ratio raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 liquidity is very strong as well cash at the parent company was about billion to further strengthen our liquidity position during a time of unprecedented economic disruption we successfully raised million 10year senior notes in march at which is included in the billion while the debt markets were really only accessible to the bluest chip companies in march we were able to get around million of subscriptions in the first three hours after launching the transaction a real testament to our strong balance sheet and longterm conservative focus and we also had an undrawn million unsecured committed revolver which doesnt mature until so with a total capital ratio of tier leverage ratio of and cash of the parent of around billion we have substantial amounts of capital and liquidity with plenty of flexibility to be defensive during this global pandemic and also opportunistic slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters when we returned approximately million back to shareholders through dividends and repurchases under the boards authorization during the fiscal second quarter the firm repurchased approximately million shares of common stock for nearly million at an average price of approximately per share share buybacks have been suspended since mid march and as at quarterend million remains available under the boards previously disclosed repurchase authorization we believe it was prudent to suspend buybacks during this pandemic even though we do have a significant amount of capital and liquidity on the next two slides we provide additional detail on the banks loan portfolio slide provides some detail on raymond james banks asset composition in the pie chart you can see we have a really welldiversified portfolio with a focus over the past few years to really grow residential mortgages and securitiesbased loans to private client group clients as well as significantly increase the size of the securities portfolio which ended the quarter at around billion in our all agencybacked securities so we have a much more diversified portfolio now than we did before the last financial crisis and then within each category we have significant amount of diversification as well for example within the ci category no industry category represents more than of total loans you can see energy represent about of total loans which i will detail on the next slide airlines represent entertainment and leisure represents restaurants represent and gaming only represents of total loans within commercial real estate almost are to reits which typically have diversified underlying real estate portfolios and the other are to mostly stabilize properties with an average loantovalue of and then just to touch on the residential mortgage portfolio most of these loans are for private client group clients across the country the average loantovalue is only and the average credit score is so a really highquality portfolio so again we feel good about our banks portfolio but with that being said its important to remember that we are really experiencing unprecedented global economic disruption so as confident as we are about the composition of the loan portfolio and our loan underwriting and monitoring processes we also acknowledge that we could experience significant credit deterioration due to the covid19 pandemic the next slide details raymond james banks energy exposure which again only represents about of total loans but million of outstanding as of march as you can see there are no ep loans in this portfolio as the credit is mostly to midstream distribution companies and convenience stores so a little less direct commodity pricing pressure but again if oil prices continue to decline then all players in the supply chain could be negatively impacted raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 so with that ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i dont know if its worth going through the opening again i know indiscernible call cut in or just should we skip it paul shoukry chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc you can skip it paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc okay and for those who didnt hear the forwardlooking statement i know you can find it on our website you know it by heart anyway so thanks paul i want to reiterate the first our primary priority our number one priority is to ensure the health and safety of our associates advisors and clients while conditions may appear to have improved in some parts of the world we must be mindful were still in the middle of a global health crisis since the working from home arrangements worked so well we continue to provide excellent services to our clients we have of our associates are working from home and weve had no technology disruptions so weve been able to service the work from home which is a testament to our associates and their focus on client service and were going to be very slow and deliberate of about bringing associates back into the office and when we believe that conditions are safe we will slowly move them in in a phased cautious manner for our nearterm outlook similar to the rest of the economy i think you should expect significant nearterm headwinds for our business in the private client group segment while our financial advisors recruiting pipelines remain strong and we have ramped up virtual recruiting and onboarding activities traditional recruiting efforts will be impacted by the travel restrictions and even the comfort levels of inperson meetings the nearterm impact on recruiting results is uncertain and it seems likely that even with a strong pipeline there will be delays and they will be disrupted until restrictions are lifted and people feel comfortable traveling and meeting in person again meanwhile the segment is going to be negatively impacted by starting fiscal third quarter with a sequential decline of assets and feebased accounts furthermore results will also be negatively impacted by the yield of thirdparty rjbdp balances declining to around basis points due to the rate cuts in march which will only be partially offset by higher cost client cash balances in capital markets segment we have a pretty healthy investment banking pipeline but we expect significant near term disruptions certainly at least for the next couple of months and while brokerage revenues surged along with market volatility in march volatility has declined thus far this quarter and wed expect brokerage revenues to decline as well following another spike in volatility which is certainly possible in the asset management segment results will be negatively impacted by our lower financial assets under management as well as the net outflows from carillon tower advisers and at raymond james bank we expect nim to decline somewhere around in the fiscal second quarter somewhere around over the next quarter or two reflecting the fed rate cuts in march and based on current libor rates other than funding the corporate revolver draws which have been slowed down significantly thus far in march we have also made the decision to raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 suspend growing the corporate loan portfolio until we have more economic stability and clarity but we will continue in leveraging our balance sheet to support our private client group clients with residential mortgages and securitybased loans we have a large bank loan provision this quarter and i know many will ask how much more do we expect but frankly there is way too much uncertainties now at this point remember we are only starting to see borrower financials from march quarter which still included two good months before march and the pandemic really showed up we took as much provision as we could reasonably justify in the second quarter but also expect to take more going forward if the economy doesnt recover quickly so not a lot of great news over the shortterm but im much more optimistic about our longterm outlook as we all reminded in the latest in the last financial crisis after a battle of longterm outperformance in our industry is surviving periods of extreme stress as paul detailed we have a substantial amount of capital and liquidity so not only are we confident in our ability to withstand a very severe economic downturn were also optimistic that we have sufficient capital and liquidity to be opportunistic and frontfooted when things stabilize our growth priorities remain unchanged our top priority is organic growth primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisers in the private client group as well as continuing to add senior talent in our other businesses such as investment banking we also continue to pursue acquisitions which we will be wellpositioned for as soon as an economic recovers and market stabilize historically these types of environments produce valuations that can be attractive to both buyers and sellers over the longterm a good example of that was our morgan keegan acquisition in after the financial crisis before we open the line for questions i just want to add while there are many uncertainties right now i know raymond james will continue to operate in a manner consistent with our longterm values these are the same values that helped guide us and withstand past economic downturns and deliver superior returns for shareholders over time its difficult to predict the severity of the economic deterioration as a result of covid i believe we are wellpositioned with our diversified business mix longterm focus and conservative principles with our strong capital and liquidity position we can proactively pursue strategic acquisitions with a consistent and disciplined approach and while our strong capital position and systems infrastructure had been critical our successful response to the pandemic and resolving market disruptions is a testament to our people i just want to thank all of our associates and advisors again for the remarkable contributions and unwavering focus on serving clients during this unprecedented crisis ive never been more proud to be part of the raymond james family with that im going to turn it over to vincent and open the line for questions vincent raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions first question comes from the line of steven chubak from wolfe research your line is now open please ask your question steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc paul and paul hope you guys are doing well just i appreciate it some of the clarifying remarks on expense and you noted higher credit costs for the primary corporate of elevated noncomps versus expectations i guess taking a step back in our recent calls youve talked about efforts to bend the cost curve slow the pace of non comp growth we started to see some early signs of that in recent quarters but even when i back out the higher provision and the nci noise it looks like core revenues were up about noncomps were up sequentially im just trying to understand how much of the noncomp inflation was maybe onetime in nature and then with revenue slated to contract from here just given the covid pressures you cited how should we think about the pace of noncomp growth in a contracting revenue environment paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah steve as you may recall from last quarter the noncompensation number that youre basing the sequential growth of last quarter of million was kind of seasonally low and so we guided for the year to get to about billion or million per quarter which would have been an increase of somewhere in the low singledigits on applestoapples basis on an annual basis so everyone was sort of looking at that million this quarter and again even with those two items you mentioned we would have been lower than that for the quarter now again a lot of that is due to some of the conferences and travel we actually had a conference an institutional conference we still had in early march before the covid crisis really broke out but we did obviously travel expenses did decrease as march progressed and the covid shelterinplace orders went into place so and some of that was offset by purchasing laptops et cetera so i would tell you that the noncomp expenses excluding the provisions kind of came in in terms of the various line items where we would have expected and where we talked about last quarter now with that being said as we progress from here the dynamics will shift a little bit as travel and conferences weve canceled a lot of the conference the two big private client group conferences this year so that dynamic will shift from here raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 and then in terms of any further actions on cost beyond that people and the compensation being our biggest cost its really during the crisis is not when you make those types of changes so we need more clarity and stability before we make broader changes in that steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for the helpful color on that paul and just one for me on credit and the provision outlook relative to a lot of your bank comps youve actually built a healthier level of provision despite having arguably lower exposure to the higher risk industry categories how should we think about the pace of provision build over the course of this year youve certainly alluded to gfc stress as maybe being the right paradigm here but thinking about loan loss reserve levels should we infer that if covid stress continues to negatively impact economic growth that we should be contemplating similar build towards 2plus or how should we really frame that as we think about the trajectory over the remainder of this year paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc i mean obviously indiscernible paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah obviously theres a lot of uncertainty going forward as youve heard from all the other banks and when you look at that allowance for loan loss which for us is about and you compare it to other banks you really have to look at the various loan categories we dont have a credit card portfolio for example some of the banks put allowances of to on those type of portfolios but within our corporate and cre portfolio around allowance for loan losses which we believe that based on what we see in the industry is a healthy number and so but going forward as healthy as we think that is it could get worse from here if the economic conditions are continue to be continue to deteriorate so steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and just one quick clarifying question paul i believe that you indicated that the thirdparty sweep program is yielding about bps i was just hoping you could speak to how these agreements are structured given a lot of banks are flushed with cash giving client derisking and aggressive qe im just wondering if the banks start to have less appetite for deposits or if youre sensing that at all and how that might impact pricing on some of these agreements paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc ill tell you early on last month or so weve actually seen just the opposite the demand from the banks and even some of the biggest banks in the country has been very strong i think some of that is somewhat related to the significant levels of revolver fundings over the last month and so weve added significant capacity with thirdparty banks at attractive rates and theyre typically one or two year type agreements and for us as of right now their floating rate agreements that are based off of fed funds target or fed funds effect raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great thanks so much for taking my questions operator next question comes from the line of chris harris from wall fargo your line is now open please ask your question christopher harris q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks guys another one on the provision i appreciate theres a lot of uncertainty but can you talk to us a bit about the potential ramifications or impacts to you from the implementation of cecl in october paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i guess too early to tell were building out all of the models and even when we run sort of parallel runs now with the models that we have theres pretty significant variations especially since the covid crisis and what macroeconomic scenarios we could use we would probably err on using some of the more conservative scenarios but again too early to tell and by the time we implement it on october conditions and assumptions are going to be a lot different so even for the banks that have already implemented cecl what were hearing on from peers and other earnings calls is that theres a lot of uncertainty and variability with the assumptions that theyre using christopher harris q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and i know you guys are sweeping lot of deposits to thirdparty banks but what is your appetite to grow the securities portfolio in this type of an environment with where yields are today paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yes we said on the last few calls we have a target to grow the securities portfolio to billion by the end of the fiscal year we actually ended the quarter at just over billion so that would represent a increase which is a significant increase for the rest of the fiscal year and well probably get to the billion at the current pace maybe a few weeks before the end of the fiscal year but obviously a lot can change between now and then in terms of the incremental balances that came in in the last four weeks were taking them off balance sheet now just to provide as much flexibility as possible we wouldnt want to make a big change in our balance sheet strategy in the middle of a global pandemic and so and certainly not with all the cash that just came in in the last three to four weeks so were open to it last time we were in a zero rate environment we didnt have a securities portfolio or agency mortgagebacked securities portfolio at all now we do and we have a lot of expertise we actually use our inhouse team the a strategic investment management services team to help us with it so we feel really good about our securities portfolio and in that the cash balances remain resilient as we get through the billion that still makes sense for us and for shareholders who certainly consider growing it even beyond that christopher harris q analyst wells fargo securities llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 okay thank you operator next question comes from the line of devin ryan from jmp securities your line is now open please ask your question devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning guys how are you paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc how are you devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc good i guess first question just on the nim guidance in the bank i appreciate the color there thats roughly what we were expecting in terms of the progression as we think about kind of beyond the next couple quarters do you see that moving lower further from there just based on the current rate curve or how should we think about that the is kind of where effectively in that range it bottoms out or are there other kind of puts and takes that would affect if we were to kind of run this out a little further next year or two paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean obviously theres going to be a lot of variables there in terms of how the asset growth in which categories that asset growth comes from within the next year or two so as best as we can tell right now give or take obviously like were moved basis points just in the last days so theres a lot of volatility even in the base rate but i think based on what we know about now thats about as far as were willing to go devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay fair enough thanks paul and then a followup here just on we talked a little bit about ma and the opportunities that can come about as a result of dislocation and as i just think about tying that into the technology investment that the firm has made in recent years and kind of how that differentiates you or when you even think about talking to financial advisors in recruiting and just in this workfromhome environment how much more important technology is today probably than ever before how is that playing into kind of the offering to advisors as youre doing these virtual recruiting sessions with them and just kind of essentially presenting the platform to them and then in terms of the ma consolidation opportunity is that maybe one of the drivers here where some of the firms that are small or maybe underinvested and were seeing the technology is going to be probably a lot more important than even anyone thought six months ago or a year ago so just love some thoughts on that both how it applies to both recruiting and ma as well paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 so for recruiting steve sorry devin that its early weve had a few what i call teller recruiting sessions that have worked our commitment backlog is good but the joining dates have slipped if you dont want to go in and open an office right now in most cases although weve had some virtual openings so its early to tell really what that impact is going to be in terms of recruiting theres nothing like a facetoface meeting especially when many people are joining us for a value proposition and to really see the technology demonstrated by with people its much more impactful so i think getting in front of people will be the key to resuming recruiting at the kind of the paces we have so my guess is it will be disrupted in terms of for the financial services indiscernible for advisers most firms did fairly well in terms of workfromhome their technology may not have been as notable but theyve been able to do that and financially selfclearing firms probably struggled without a if they didnt have a lot of capital in first week or two but thats settled down too so i think its going to be a little bit longerterm where people have to see that strategically as we recruit because of our systems i think firms are going to have to say you know what were just too far behind between regulatory and recruiting and technology that we need to go somewhere else so i wouldnt expect in the private client group space any rapid movement and we wish those firms well theyre friendly firms to us but hopefully someday they make a decision theyll join us i think theres probably more opportunity if this crisis if theres a slow return in ma weve had discussions in the investment banking and then ma space for a while now and pricing tended to be the issue and well see what happens to pricing indiscernible i think people will get more interested if its shortterm and ma bounces back then i think therell be less opportunity so were very actively keeping up the dialogue and were just going to have to see again just like the crisis its too early to tell a slow recovery will need more probably reserves and a slower market and but maybe more ma opportunity and a faster recovery may make the loan portfolio much more robust and the market goes up with maybe ma opportunities wont be as available so its just too hard to tell it seems like forever but were six weeks in really so its being economists we count the days a little they seem a little slower but didnt had a lot of time where we are in this pandemic so far devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah i hear you there okay well thanks paul appreciate it ill leave it there thanks for taking my questions paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks devin operator next question comes from the line of craig siegenthaler from credit suisse your line is now open please ask your question gautam sawant q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc broker good morning this is gautam sawant stepping in for craig raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey how are you doing gautam sawant q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc broker my question doing well whats your decision to raise an additional million and how do you feel about your liquidity and capital position with billion of cash at the parent level paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc what drove it was honestly we debated with about a dayandahalf dollar cash revolver thats secured and committed by we think some of the biggest and healthiest finical institutions that we really need cash and the first answer was probably not but we decided to ive never seen a firm go broke as they have much cash or a firm that they couldnt execute an opportunity because they have too much cash so we looked at the pros and cons and decided that our extreme capital levels that weve had or indiscernible so now were billion in cash in a billion undrawn line of credit so we feel we did it if this crisis is more severe then we imagine well still be fine were multiples of the cash and capital that we had going into the crisis if theres a acquisition opportunity we are ready to go part of our morgan keegan acquisition happened because we were able to execute both with our cash on hand and in an overnight committed line that indiscernible will execute very quickly at a time where it was very uncertain you can execute so again we felt being liquid was probably more important than the extra interest cost so we went ahead and just found an offering gautam sawant q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc broker thank you operator next question comes from the line of alex blostein from goldman sachs your line is now open please ask your question alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks good morning guys couple questions so i guess just going back to credit dynamics and the provision in the quarter can you help us understand i guess some of the macro ramparts that you considered whether its gdp growth or something that we can help sensitize to what degree if we see further deterioration of portfolio or an economy we could see additional reserve builds or kind of whats the baseline assumption and any sensitivity around additional deterioration paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc we dont implement cecl until october so its not so formulaic for us yet because we have a september fiscal yearend so our cecl implantation starts at the beginning of our next fiscal year so its not quite as formulaic were still under the incurred loss model where were really trying to go loan by loan and do make the decision on a bottomsup basis raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i know those reserves were generated mainly on the industries that we thought in sectors that were very covid affected so thats where most of that all that reserve been came from alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you and then i guess unrelated just back to the conversation around expenses and comp appreciate your comments around the comp rate obviously been skewed this quarter by the private equity dynamic thats pretty clear but i guess if you look at some of the segments the comp rate in capital markets specifically picked up pretty materially at around in the quarter so i guess maybe you drove that and then taking a step back can you help us think about what the comp rate for the firm should look like for the rest of the year paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah within the capital markets segment that comp ratio was negatively impacted this quarter by a revenue mix and we dont break it out anymore after revenue recognition changes last year but we did have some trading losses on inventories in the capital markets segment whether its not the same direct compensation associated with those trading losses as we have with the significant growth and commissions we had in the segment during the quarter and of course on a yearoveryear basis ma was down significantly from a very strong yearago quarter so its really attributable to the revenue mix and particularly the trading losses on the inventories in aggregate though kind of stepping back answering the overall question obviously theres going to be negative pressure or upward pressure on the comp ratio just due to lower interest rates and the negative impact that lower interest rates has on noncompensable revenues the net interest income and rjbdp from thirdparty banks are going to be down based on the guidance that we just provided and those dont have direct compensation associated with it so you can look back and forth the period in a zero rate environment obviously that puts upward pressure on our comp ratio but were not because of all the volatility with the other line items and the impact of revenue mix were not in a position now to provide a new target for that paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think too its important to note that those trading losses a lot of them were generated by fixed income in our unique kind of balance sheet one of our strongest sectors has been in the nontaxable indiscernible finance and even though that portfolio was almost entirely investment graded in those securities traded well in this downturn they did not so we went ahead and lowered those i think we have the lowest inventory weve ever had and fixed income right now went ahead and sold them out and that generated some trading losses but its left with indiscernible liquid nimble alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it okay that kind of makes sense can i just squeeze in one more around just the capital return dynamics and the balance sheet management so obviously nice to see you guys do a successful debt offering but just given the significant model liquidity on the balance sheet can you give us some thoughts around kind of rationale behind going out and raising longterm debt today that for and your refi activity or anything else we should be thinking about there thanks raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think if you look at our capital one of our clear messages we have a lot more capital and cash even today were very unlevered compared to most of our competitors so one of the challenges we had even if lets say the world continued and were buying back stock we were to had to raise that for liquidity europe we did an acquisition we would have to raise debt or equity for liquidity so i think what you see is us just being a little more aggressive than getting our cash liquidity more in line with our capital so that we have flexibility and we felt the market has a recovered and is starting to do better but weve also seen periods where the market wasnt open for periods of time and felt that even at that cost it was a good tradeoff to have more liquidity more in keeping with the capital we have to give us flexibility whether we end up doing an acquisition or buying back shares eventually where have a cash to build and execute on that alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks for taking all the questions paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thanks alex operator and the last question comes from the line of bill katz from citi your line is now open please ask your question q hi this is actually ph lilly dialing in for bill katz so thank you so much for taking this question and hope everyone is staying safe and healthy so just have questions round capital markets im wondering what are the current equity and fixed income sellside trends into april and what would be the key factors to get ma going in paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think for ma in capital markets its just confidence where the economy is going so surprisingly indiscernible backlog has been very resilient and people are still talking or waiting i think if you see an economic recovery start to happen then the transactions will pick up if you see a very slow recovery or a recurrence of virus youre going to see ma activity really fall off so again its very economicdependent and in fixed income i think it preserve we did very well well get our trading losses as i described later but the volume and the profitability of that segment has been good certainly march from a commission basis was outsized for everybody with the increased volatility but even as volatility settled down we still have reasonably good volumes in our fixed income trading sales business so feeling pretty good about that sector q raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 30apr2020 all right thank you so much operator no further questions please continue paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc wed like to sorry you missed the opening but we open we think about all everyone affected by covid directly and indirectly as were recognized with us and our industry is
