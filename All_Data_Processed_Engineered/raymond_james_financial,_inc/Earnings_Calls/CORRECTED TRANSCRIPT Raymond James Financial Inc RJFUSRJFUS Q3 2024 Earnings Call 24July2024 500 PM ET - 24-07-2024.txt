results will not differ materially from those expressed in these statements we urge you to consider the risks described in our most recent s so we and others are admittedly scrutinizing some of these cash disclosures much more closely your disclosures note that raymond james shares a portion of the revenue from sweep options with the advisor so admittedly your firm with a longstanding reputation for putting clients first but as conflicts are scrutinized more closely is there a concern that the method for which advisors are compensated does create some inherent conflict and how should we think about that in terms of the goforward paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc no thats a great question and let me explain the disclosure first so on advisory accounts cash has no different payment in terms of the advisor than any other asset class so if they have million account and theyre charging theyre getting in fees if theres zero cash theyre getting in fees if theres cash theyre getting in fees there is no indirect incentives on trips or rewards or points or anything there is zero incentive in advisory account to do anything but whats in the best interest of your client and i assure you theres nothing from home office that you can ask about it weve been known and continue to the advisor should be doing the right things for their clients and of course we have supervision making sure it doesnt go the other way but we have a great group of advisors and by the movements theyre doing what they should be doing the disclosure really talks about some limited things and the brokerage side and let me explain that one that weve had some fund raising programs like the esp program where for high rate money market types of rates that weve allowed advisors to be compensated in those programs they are not compensated a penny on the sweeps so the only incentive that they have is to go is to put clients for compensation in the higher rate accounts they have zero compensation on below rate accounts so brokerages be like dropping a ticket into some of their investment as they put it into those high rate accounts theyre doing the right thing for clients it costs us more money so we dont believe theres any conflict whatsoever but the fact that weve done that in limited cases we put that disclosure in to cover that and regulatory wise they like it very clear that you you said that you could pay that you are paying but its been a very a nuanced circumstance but again its all for the very high rate types of programs steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 no thats really helpful very fulsome response paul so thank you one point i just wanted to clarify because you specifically mentioned its not part of the advisor program which is consistent with what we saw too but it also notes that you dont share comp directly with the financial advisor but the aggregate amount of cash gets credited to the overall payout rate and can cause your fa to receive higher comp on transactions and other unrelated activities its vague i dont know what those activities could be but if you could provide some context around that as well just given the focus on this issue paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah when youre looking at the focus on cash thats the only thing i can imagine thats the only thing where theres compensation at all for cash directly or indirectly its just on that very small investment vehicles like esp that we put into brokerage and thats it i mean there is no other advisors have opportunities on asset growth and net new assets but has nothing to do with cash i mean they bring in net new assets we have a net new asset a program that can benefit advisors but its nothing its not centered on cash steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc all right understood thats very helpful color if i could just squeeze in one more quickly just paul shoukry on the flat spread revenue guide was a bit better than we had anticipated thats certainly nice to hear i was hoping you could unpack some of the factors to support the flat spread revenue quarteronquarter just given theres been some upward pressure on funding costs tailwind of ph sorting but still some incremental ph sorting however modest i was hoping you could provide some context on what some of the key assumptions are underpinning that paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc yeah so kind of offsetting some of the funding cost pressures that youve describing there is a loan growth that we experienced throughout the quarter and the continued asset growth that we would hope to experience going forward so thats we said flat or maybe down nominally but thats whats driving that guidance steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc perfect thats great color thanks for taking my questions paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc thanks steve operator your next question comes from the line of dan fannon with jefferies your line is open daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good evening i guess one more question on this just in terms of the competitive backdrop does your evaluation period does this imply that you need to see additional changes across the industry for you to potentially react or are you still digesting these most recent moves and need to get more color around what they exactly were raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think were are we digesting sure and were watching but i mean i dont again we dont anticipate anything as you learn things you might make tweaks here or there but were just going to have to see what plays out as what we know today but well talk about it at our next cash ph bidding but we have no plans going in to make changes at this point but that doesnt mean we wont daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc understood and then just in terms of the backlog around recruiting you mentioned record backlog of large teams thats a comment i think youve been making for several quarters so just curious if theres additional context thinking given the strong net new assets in the quarter the funding kind of bring onboarding that youre seeing versus the replenishment of that backlog if theres any other additional color it would be helpful paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah weve been the recruiting is actually backlog has been picking up its extremely strong as i said the last few quarters were not surprised by it anymore but we were surprised the large number of million million even million teams its continuing and we continue to get new ones both joining committed and in the pipeline that i think were competing very very well for so the recruiting activity remains strong and were still very optimistic on it and i think were we dont see anything right now thats slowing down the pace so thats been really good news for us daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs your line is open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning paul and paul sorry good afternoon its been a rather long day you know all about that im going to start with another question somewhat related to this sweep is it possible for you to identify what portion of your advisory assets or the advisory assets i should say on the ray jay platform where ray jay is considered a fiduciary paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well theres so many words there are so many terms on fiduciary right theres a risk of fiduciary theres best interest theres and they all have different responsibilities and rules and everything else so i dont know the best number we could give paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 let me what we could say is that within fee based all feebased accounts we have about billion of cash sweep balances and that excludes the custody business and then within that to pauls point its very theres some risk of fiduciary theres some other types of programs within that but thats all feebased accounts brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah and some of those are firm indiscernible some of them are advisors with discretion and theres some with advisors without discretion where they have to clear everything with the client so they so but thats the total number if you looked at it brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it the billion is the sweep in the sum of all of those accounts paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah yeah and again ph almost the average on those accounts is and so its not its really the residual cash residing on average in those sweeps brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sure paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc in those account yeah brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that and then net new assets was pretty decent actually this quarter was curious whether you guys flagged the osj as a pending headwind and i apologize if you touched on this and i missed it but did that event that you flagged at the investor day come to pass and what was the size of that as far as a net new asset impact paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so we anticipate one coming its probably in the next quarter so thats the one weve been talking about but it hasnt happened indiscernible but we anticipate it will still happen and thats what we wanted to flag but it has not happened yet raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay so thats still thats coming likely in the coming quarter paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yes the fourth calendar quarter brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of kyle voigt with kbw your line is open kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good evening maybe a question on the thirdparty bank sweep yield falling by basis points sequentially and about basis points over the last two quarters just wondering if you could clarify if there any changes made to rates or tiers that partially drove that and also clarify whats driving this in terms of mix shift towards the higher yield sweep offerings is that simply a shift of cash towards higher balance tiers or is there something else driving the negative mix shift paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc hey kyle yeah a lot of that is initiatives that we run where we offer kind of a higher rate for new cash that comes into the sweep program to the firm andor maturities from money market funds treasuries and those type of things where clients want the functionality of the sweep program but want a comparable rate to move over and benefit from the fdic insurance and the availability of the cash in the sweep program so as weve kind of implemented those initiatives weve been able to effectively bring over cash from those sources through the quarter which while it increases the average cost of the funding it increases also the amount of funding that we have and its net still net attractive so its really a winwinwin initiative that weve put into place in the sweep programs kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay is there any way to quantify the percentage of those thirdparty sweeps that are in the newer high yield or the money market fund kind of equivalent yield program or paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc i think now its roughly somewhere in the to range of the total sweep balances that are in those type of programs kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 understood okay thank you and then just as a followup just on repurchases you mentioned your desire to increase the pace of repurchases from here you executed on about million of repurchases in the prior quarter should we think about that ramping to million or million any way you can quantify the increase in that pace moving forward paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc were not programmatic so we dont were not going to give you a hard number a lot of factors play into it in terms of the sources and uses of cash and capital but yeah we definitely intend on increasing the pace from million which i know was higher than many people expected even during the this past quarter so but we have lots of capital lots of cash and we remain committed to keeping that within our targets over a reasonable period of time paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah as weve said if we couldnt find the were still looking at ma activities its our preferred but if we couldnt find it wed return it and we havent been able to find them yet so were going to start being more aggressive on returning the capital ratios back where we think they should be kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of bill katz with td cowen your line is open william katz q analyst td cowen great thank you very much taking the question i do want to pick up on that last question so either of you pauls and thank you both just in terms of the commentary of reallocating maybe to a bit more buyback is the deal pipeline at a strategic level is it just less fulsome is it just hard to make the economics work is anything shifting in the backdrop here that sort of pushes out that opportunity and relatedly if a deal were to come back would you then forego or truncate the underlying buyback thank you paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think the very active theres reasonable opportunities some are pricey but for us its the right culture fit and integration and frankly were as you can see by this quarter in the last few earnings are very very strong so those capital ratio ph tweaks up we want to get it back in a proper range so we think we can still be a lot more aggressive on the buybacks and still have ample capital if something happens so its just saying and we dont expect anything of a size that theres no reason not to be more aggressive on returning it to you to shareholders william katz q analyst td cowen okay just to clarify is still the appropriate tier leverage ratio guidepost as you think about sort of going back to its normal capital ratios raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc yeah is still our target right now for tier leverage william katz q analyst td cowen indiscernible great terrific and then sort of second question going back to your outlook for the stable nii and cash sweep dynamics how should we think about any residual adverse mix shift into some of these higher fee products and is there any leakage here that existing customers theyre not necessarily bringing new money in but well look at that and say hey why cant i get that kind of rate and sort of put a little more downward pressure on the net yield and maybe the other way i like to ask the question is indiscernible so much but what is now the net rate the client is ultimately getting here on the cash sweep thank you paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc yeah so we offer our grid starts as paul said from basis points goes all the way up to on the cash sweep program and there has been some migration and mix shift to the higher yielding programs and initiatives that weve offered which are actually closer to and so what all of this is happening what hasnt really been there for the us or the industry is loan growth and thats actually impacted our capital ratios as well because our earnings have been very strong but the loan growth across the industry has been muted so thats ultimately the driver of both nim and more importantly net interest income which actually impacts the bottom line will be driven by loan growth which will drive higher yields and higher earnings overall and so thats kind of what were as an industry waiting for we started seeing some improvement on the sbl side and were optimistic that with more corporate activity well start seeing more activity on the corporate side eventually as well operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global your line is open jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning good afternoon sorry just maybe paul can you talk about deposit betas in the face of rate cuts how do you at least think your asset sensitivity would look in the first basis points can you kind of almost get a one for one offset or how are you thinking about betas paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc itll largely depend on the competitive environment but because we have been generous in passing rates to clients and through these other programs that have near money market fund rates like enhanced savings program et cetera that we should have a lot of sensitivity to the downside as well on the both the asset and on the funding side of things so yeah we do feel like we have an ample amount of cushion but again itll depend on the competitive environment and the demand for cash across the industry as rates go down paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 if youre in a sweep if you have a sweep program its basis point to basis points you got a basis point drop over two cycles its kind of hard to respond now we have plenty of room in ours and still be very competitive in the market today jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right so paul when you think about next year and we think about the forward curve on fed funds kind of a gradual say bps it seems like you guys might hold up a little bit better especially if loan growth picks up and you still have some repricing in the securities portfolio right because the yields are still pretty low there you put all that together do you have i mean i know theres competitive pricing but do you feel like you guys can hold in there pretty well next year on nii paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc yeah putting aside whether i believe the forward curve or not jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right fair enough paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc yeah weve generated record results now for the last three years and three quarters and those were in very different interest rate environments and so we are confident in our ability to perform very well in any kind of interest rate environment because we have diversified and complementary businesses so for example lower interest rates at least in the last cycle certainly supported our ma business and our fixed income business and supported loan growth we had record securities based loan growth during the covid period because partly due to the lower rates so theres different things that benefit us in different rate environments but to your point on a relative basis because we have been so generous and passing on the rates to our clients and offering these other programs we feel like were relatively wellpositioned on that front as well jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of michael cyprys with morgan stanley your line is open michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks for taking the question just circling back to the industry conversation on the movement in suites just curious more broadly how you see potential scope maybe over time for an evolution in the way customers pay for services and away from cash sweep just curious what other ways over time could you envision some years in the future potentially in some hypothetical scenario where customers take differently for services and how might one still capture economics for the services they provide what other ways might you be able to capture value raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i guess theres so many ways its hard to tell right and a big source of growth and income used to be can be one fees and other things and theyve become less of a factor over time certainly assetbased fees if you look at ph rias and how they price versus the broker dealers assetbased pricing is becoming more common theres all sorts of ways and part of that depends on regulatory you could have performance fees you could have i think its hard to tell where it evolves i think in the business i dont people talked about consulting fees or hourly rates i dont think anyone likes a lawyer or accountants go on indiscernible hours so i dont think i will go there especially given the value of the relationship with an advisor where they its very its everyone always thinks about the investment part that is part of it but a lot of it is really the advise the family advisors and they become a big part of the lives of clients so theres all sorts of stuff that they change anyway over time maybe itll get more asset based we certainly have countries that the uk australia where its just direct charges the clients have to be in fee so its very clear ph could have ball roll sorts of ways but its a very competitive mature industry and i think that people will find a way to adjust weve had to adjust through zero interest rates and high interest rates and all sorts of things and weve kind of adjust that as weve gone along so years out in our industry seems like forever maybe its because im old and paul has to worry about it but michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks for that and just a followup question more broadly on cash sorting and cash sweep balances just curious how close do you think we are to bottom and eventually starting to see that grow again what catalyst do you see on horizon that might get us there and how might the recent evolving competitive backdrop and industry discussions here and debates on the sweep rate how might that impact cash sweep balances just given the heightened focus and attention that its getting paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc yeah i mean we continue to believe that were closer to the end of the sorting cycle than the beginning and some of the metrics that paul discussed just in the feebased accounts having of cash per cash sweeps per account whereas we have of money market funds cds and treasuries a lot of these clients to the extent they had investable cash balances have been invested in the higher yielding alternatives were not as weve always said since the very beginning and were one of the first if not the first to say it were not going to declare the end of the trend until we have several quarters of history to look back on and start seeing growth in the cash balances and ultimately that growth will come from the stabilization of the runoff and the migration and the growth of the continued growth which weve had phenomenal growth of client assets therell be cash associated with that and that ultimately will drive the growth in the balances michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator your final question will come from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs your line is open raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey guys good afternoon thanks for taking the question so appreciate all the detail and obviously its a dynamic backdrop so were all kind of navigating and learning from it so appreciate that theres still a ton of unknowns there but i guess as you think about that billion sweep number that you provided and i think most of us understand that it is fairly small and it and its largely operational but i guess at the heart of the question what were all kind of trying to figure out is why is transactional or operational cash albeit small on a per account basis but is still part of the advisory relationship would be treated differently under the fiduciary standard of reg bi and why wouldnt that cash balance again albeit small still receive sort of some of the higher yields that are available out there paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well i guess my quick answer would be what do you get on your checking account right theres a cost to having it on the platform theres a cost to servicing it its transactional so it has more transactions so there is a cost i mean it is the standard for bi is you have to pay a rate that way on the economic to operate a business i dont know what that means and i dont think that is the standard under bi but clients first and be fair and take their interests at heart first and i think that transactional cash basis points is a lot more than youre going to get on your checking account very reasonable so i mean there may be disagreements i think a standard like that is i wouldnt understand how you could come up with that so its alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i guess the difference is like the checking account is not a fiduciary relationship versus this seems to be one and i guess thats where the disconnect comes in and what could be the outcome of all of this paul c reilly a chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc there are a lot of fiduciary accounts i agree with that you look at institutional asset managers they have a fiduciary relationship but they dont have zero cash in their portfolios so i mean so if you want to benchmark it to other fiduciary relationships of this type of investments it would be a real outlier to say all that cash has to be invested because its not reality the way accounts work that would say we have to not only sort the costs so wed have to fund the transactions because it wouldnt be cash in the account or sell out securities in order to fund these transactions or other things i mean i just i think that to me thats not a reasonable standard alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you all right understood all right my quick followup paul the old paul back to the discussion around thirdparty bank sweep and the rate changes and the migration that youve seen there do you expect that to be largely done or there could be still some mix shift where some of the larger account balances will kind of push that yield a little bit lower and to what extent i guess is that if at all incorporated in your sort of flattish cash revenue trajectory for next quarter versus this quarter paul m shoukry a president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 24jul2024 yeah well we have i mean the initiative itself we have some levers on around largely rate right so to the extent that we want to continue bringing in cash from the outside rate is a big lever we actually just announced that were reducing the rate on the high yield portion of the program that brings in the new cash from the outside because we have a pretty big buffers now with over billion of cash swept up thirdparty banks that we can reposition and bring on to fund our own bank over time so it really just depends on how much of the initiative that we want continue to pull in that we actually again just announced that were reducing the rate its still very attractive higher than but you were not going to again declare completion of any type of trend until we have several quarters of history otherwise its just speculation alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got you sorry and the reduction on the it was at esp or is that the program that sits within thirdparty bank sweep paul m shoukry q president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc yeah thats the sweep initiative thats right alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it okay all right thank you guys appreciate it paul m shoukry q president chief financial officer director raymond james financial inc thanks alex operator there are no further questions at this time ill turn the call to paul reilly for closing remarks paul c reilly chair chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well appreciate the all the questions here on the call i want to remind everybody we had a very good quarter but i understand all the questions on the cash sweep so appreciate hope we were helpful in all of our responses and thank you for joining us operator this concludes todays conference call we thank you for joining you
