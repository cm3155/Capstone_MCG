financial inc good afternoon and thank you for joining us today although there is a lot of disappointment for us in the bucks playoff game and even more disappointment for me is paul shoukrys bulldogs won the national championship raymond james came through again with another good solid performance during a volatile and challenging market environment we generated strong quarterly results including record net income available to common shareholders of million annualized return on common equity of and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of once again these results highlight the value of having diverse and complementary businesses record private client group results driven by robust organic raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 growth along with strong expansion of net interest margins in the bank segment and yields on the rjbdp balances at thirdparty banks in the pcg segment offset marketdriven declines experienced through the capital markets businesses as demonstrated this quarter with the sharp increase in net interest income and rjbdp fees we have been and remain wellpositioned for continued rise in shortterm interest rates with diverse and ample funding sources a high concentration of floating rate assets and strong balance sheet flexibility given solid capital ratios turning now to the results starting on slide in the first fiscal quarter the firm reported net revenues of billion record pretax income of million and record net income available to common shareholders of million or per diluted share excluding expenses related to acquisitions and the favorable impact of a million insurance settlement received during the quarter adjusted net income available to common shareholders was million or per diluted share quarterly net revenues were flat compared to the prior year quarter and down compared to the preceding quarter largely driven by the benefit of higher shortterm interest rates on net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks offset by the marketdriven declines in investment banking revenues and asset management and related administrative fees record quarterly net income available to common shareholders increased over the prior years fiscal first quarter largely due to higher net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks and as i mentioned earlier we generated very strong returns with annualized return on common equity of and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of impressive results especially given the challenging market conditions and our strong capital position moving on to slide we ended the quarter with total client assets under administration of trillion pcg assets in feebased accounts of billion and financial assets under management of billion with our unwavering focus on retaining supporting and attracting highquality financial advisers pcg consistently generates strong organic growth we ended the quarter with nearly financial advisers and generated domestic net new assets of billion in the quarter representing a annualized growth rate on beginning of the period domestic pcg assets net new assets were strong this quarter and also helped by the seasonally high interest and dividends received in december over the trailing 12month period we generated net new asset growth of of domestic pcg assets at the beginning of the period during the same 12month period we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels financial advisers with nearly million of trailing 12month production and approximately billion of client assets at their previous firms total clients domestic cash sweep balance has declined to billion representing of domestic pcg assets under administration the domestic suite balances represent our lowest cost deposits as we have yet to utilize enhanced yield savings accounts to attract cash deposits total bank loans grew sequentially to a record billion reflecting growth at both raymond james bank and tristate capital bank moving to slide the private client group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million assetbased revenues declined however the segments results were lifted by the benefit from higher shortterm interest rates including increased yields on rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks and the bank segment raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 the capital markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of million and a pretax loss of million capital markets revenues declined compared to the recordsetting results in the prior year and quarter mostly driven by lower investment banking revenues largely due to the volatile and uncertain markets the asset management segment generated pretax income of million on net revenues of million the decreases in net revenue and pretax income were largely attributable to lower financial assets under management as the net inflows to feebased accounts in the private client group were offset by a yearoveryear fixed income and equity markets decline the bank segment generated record quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million net revenue growth was primarily due to higher loan balances and significant expansion of the banks net interest margin to for the quarter up basis points over a year ago quarter and basis points from the preceding quarter reflecting the flexible and floating rate nature of our balance sheet and now for more detailed review of our financial first quarter results im going to turn the call over to paul shoukry paul paul shoukry chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul starting with consolidated revenues on slide quarterly net revenues of billion were flat yearoveryear and declined sequentially asset management and related administrative fees declined compared to the prior year quarter and compared to the preceding quarter in line with the guidance we provided on last quarters call based on lower feebased assets at the end of the preceding quarter due to the equity market declines this quarter feebased assets grew this growth should provide a tailwind for asset management and related administrative fees which we expect to increase to in the fiscal second quarter reflecting two fewer billable days brokerage revenues of million declined compared to the prior years fiscal first quarter and grew over the preceding quarter the yearoveryear decline was largely due to lower fixed income and equity brokerage revenues in the capital markets segment as well as lower assetbased trail revenues in pcg ill discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly in a much more difficult market environment than we anticipated on last quarters call investment banking revenues of million declined compared to the record set in the prior year quarter and compared to the preceding quarter despite a healthy pipeline and good engagement levels there remains a lot of uncertainty in the pace and timing of deal closings given the heightened market volatility at this point it is too difficult to say when conditions will become conducive to increase creativity other revenues of million declined sequentially primarily due to lower revenues in the affordable housing investments business which was seasonally high in the preceding quarter looking forward this business continues to have a strong pipeline moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at billion down compared to the preceding quarter and representing of domestic pcg client assets the sweep balance declines were experienced in the client interest program at the brokerdealer as well as with thirdparty banks as of last friday these balances have declined to just under billion reflecting the quarterly fee payments of approximately billion paid in january as well as additional cash sorting activity during the month raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 the raymond james bank deposit sweep program continues to be a relatively lowcost source of funding and tristate capital bank adds an independent deposit franchise providing a more diversified funding base and as we have seen deposits decline significantly across the entire financial system we realize even greater value in having multiple funding sources to that end we are also in the process of launching an enhanced yield savings program for our private client group clients turning to slide combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks was million up over the prior years fiscal first quarter and over the preceding quarter this strong growth reflects the immediate impact from higher shortterm rates given the limited duration and high concentration of floating rate assets on our balance sheet our longstanding approach has been to maintain a high concentration of floating rate assets which is proving to be a significant tailwind in this rising rate environment the banks net interest margin shown on the bottom portion of the slide increased basis points sequentially to for the quarter and the average yield on rjbdp balances with thirdparty banks increased basis points to both the nim and the average yield on rjbdp balances increased more than we expected on last quarters call as the deposit beta on the last rate increase was closer to the spot nim for the bank segment is currently close to and the spot yield on rjbdp balances is approximately so we currently expect continued nearterm tailwinds for net interest income and related fees despite the ongoing cash sorting activity the anticipated rate increases should also help but remember there are two fewer days in the second fiscal quarter while we still have sweep balances with thirdparty banks that could be redeployed to the bank segment longer term if rates stabilize at these levels we expect the banks nim will be impacted by the mix of deposits anticipating a larger portion of higher cost deposits being utilized to fund the future balance sheet growth while we are pleased to see the significant nim expansion as we have said in the past we have always prioritized net interest income over net interest margin and our goal is to continue growing net interest income as we deliberately grow the balance sheet over time moving to consolidated expenses on slide beginning with our largest expense compensation the total compensation ratio for the quarter was nearly flat from the preceding quarter the adjusted compensation ratio was during the quarter despite lower capital markets revenues the compensation ratio largely reflects the significant benefit from higher net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks as a reminder the impact of salary increases effective on january and the reset of payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year will be reflected in the fiscal second quarter noncompensation expenses of million decreased sequentially adjusting for acquisitionrelated noncompensation expenses of million and the favorable impact received of million both included in our nongaap earnings adjustments non compensation expenses were million during the quarter the bank loan provision for credit losses of million in the quarter primarily reflects changes to macroeconomic assumptions used in the cecl models as well as modest loan growth im proud of our continued ph discipline management of expenses exhibited again this quarter where we remain focused on investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisers and their clients given the benefits from higher shortterm interest rates we expect to maintain our compensation ratio well below as it has been around over the past two quarters even with much lower revenues in the capital markets raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 segment this quarter noncompensation expenses excluding provision for credit losses and the aforementioned nongaap adjustments are still expected to be around billion for the fiscal year slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters in the fiscal first quarter we generated a pre tax margin of a very strong result highlighting the benefit of our diversified business model the upside we preserve to higher shortterm interest rates and our consistent focus on being disciplined on expenses similar to my comments on the compensation ratio given the interest rate tailwinds we currently believe we are well positioned to continue delivering pretax margins above the previously disclosed to target however given the cash sorting dynamics as well as interest rate and market uncertainty we believe it is premature to formally update our targets in this volatile environment on slide at quarter end total assets were billion a sequential decrease primarily reflecting the decline in client interest program cash balances the reduction of balance sheet assets helped increase the tier leverage ratio during the quarter liquidity and capital remained very strong rjf corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at billion well above our billion target the tier leverage ratio of and the total capital ratio of are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth the effective tax rate for the quarter was reflecting a tax benefit recognized for sharebased compensation that vested during the period going forward we still believe to is an appropriate estimate to use in your models slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters in december the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend on common shares to per share and authorized share repurchases of up to billion replacing the previous authorization of billion during the fiscal first quarter the firm repurchased million shares of common stock for million at an average price of per share as of january billion remained available under the boards approved common stock repurchase authorization since the closing of the tristate acquisition on june through january we have repurchased approximately million common shares for million or approximately per share under the board authorization we remain committed to offset the share issuance associated with the acquisition of tristate as well as sharebased compensation dilution and still expect to achieve our objective of repurchasing billion of shares in fiscal but of course we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and other capital needs as we plan for these repurchases over the coming quarters lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment which includes raymond james bank and tristate capital bank the credit quality of the loan portfolio remain healthy criticized loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at down from at december nearly flat sequentially the yearoveryear decline in the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment reflects the higher proportion of securitiesbased loans largely due to the acquisition of tristate capital bank securitiesbased loans which account for approximately of our bank loan portfolio are generally collateralized by marketable securities and typically do not require an allowance for credit losses raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 the bank allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percentage of corporate loans held for investment was at quarter end we believe this represents an appropriate reserve but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation supply chain constraints ph and a potential recession on our corporate loan portfolio now ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul as i said in the start of the call im pleased with our results and our ability to generate record earnings during what continues to be a very volatile market and while there are many uncertainties we believe we are well positioned to drive growth over the long term across all of our businesses in the private client group next quarter results will be favorably impacted by the expected to sequential increase in asset management and related administrative fees additionally the segment will continue to benefit from higher shortterm interest rates as described by paul focusing more on the long term i am optimistic we will continue delivering industryleading growth as current and prospective advisers are attracted to our client focused values and leading technology and production solutions in the capital markets segment while ma pipelines remain healthy the pace and timing of the closings will be heavily influenced by market conditions and in the fixed income space depository clients are experiencing declining deposit balances and have less cash available for investing in securities putting pressure on our brokerage activity however sumridge with its rapidly evolving fixed income and trading technology marketplace enhances our position as this business typically benefits from elevated rate volatility over the long term we are well positioned across capital markets for growth given the investments we have made over the past five years which have significantly increased our productive capacity and market share in the asset management segment financial assets under management are starting the fiscal second quarter up compared to the preceding quarter which should provide a tailwind to revenues if markets remain conducive we remain confident that the strong growth of assets in feebased accounts in the private client group segment will drive longterm growth of financial assets under management in addition we expect raymond james investment management which generated modest net inflows this quarter to help drive further growth through increased scale distribution operational and marketing synergies and the bank segment is well positioned for rising shortterm interest rates and has ample capital to grow the balance sheet prudently however in an increasing rate environment loan growth will face headwinds until rates stabilize and borrowers adjust to a new normal in the cost of borrowings additionally as cash sorting has continued in the sweep program we expect to increase the focus on funding the growth of the banks balance sheet with higher cost diversified sources over the long term currently we have sweep balances at thirdparty banks that could be redeployed to the bank segment however the past has also taught us that cash sweep balances can decrease or increase rapidly depending on market conditions importantly the credit quality of the bank segments loan portfolio remains strong and we are closely watching economic conditions related to the lending portfolio in just a short period since the closing of the acquisition of tristate capital i am very pleased with their performance staying true to tristates independent operating model including remaining a separately chartered bank with its own client relationships this model coupled with our strong capital should foster its ongoing growth raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 its no accident that our businesses are positioned well for future growth it is a result of our steady focus on making decisions for the long term especially in volatile and uncertain market conditions we are well positioned for the continued rise in shortterm interest rates with diverse funding sources solid loan growth high concentration of floating rate assets and ample balance sheet flexibility given the solid capital ratios which are all well in excess of regulatory requirements finally in these uncertain times is when clients need trusted advice the most and i want to thank our advisers and associates for their unwavering dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day our strong results are a direct reflection of your contributions so thank you very much to all of you with that operator will you please open it up for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and the first question comes from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities please proceed with your question devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey thanks hi paul and paul how are you indiscernible paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc good nice to speak with you after the press release in the evening which is great i guess just a couple quick ones on my end first on the buyback so you repurchased million its a bit below the implied million average target and so i guess the implications theres going to be some catchup so im just trying to understand the factors that impacted the cadence whether it was being price conscious or were you in blackout through the quarter that we didnt see or maybe any other reasons just trying to think about again kind of the cadence there paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc no were still targeting the billion of repurchases for fiscal as weve said several times now and so that obviously means we would have to ratchet that up on an average basis going forward to get to that billion mark there was a lot of volatility in this particular quarter and then as you point out theres always a blackout period so we were pleased to get million in but understand that to hit our target going forward were going to have to kind of increase that average raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 but with that being said were still going to a lot can change between now and the end of the fiscal year so we do monitor market conditions and all the sources and uses that we have for cash and capital of the firm devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc got it okay thank you and then just to followup here on net interest income in private clients so thats been obviously very strong and that came in better than we were looking for and we see the decline in the kind of the client interest program and so just trying to think about the other drivers there was the kind of continued strength there driven by margin and just higher margin rate or some of your peers had some sec lending that helped as well so im curious if there was any kind of lumpy sec lending in there just trying to think about some of the moving parts thats keeping that really strong paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc sec lending was not a driver really it was just the higher yields on both the segregated assets pursuant to the brokerdealer regulations as well as the higher yields on the margin balances but i will point out going forward sort of the last in first out type of cash is really the client interest program cash and that has declined the most dramatically during this cash sorting cycle and so were probably at around billion to billion of those balances today versus sort of the average balance for the quarter of billion so that would be something you would need to consider which would partially be offset by the higher rates going forward as well factoring in a full quarter of last quarters rate hikes and potential rate hikes this quarter but something that you would need to factor into your modeling devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yes understood okay great ill leave it there thank you very much paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc thanks devin paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks devin operator and the next question comes from the line of gerry ohara with jefferies please proceed with your question gerald edward ohara q analyst jefferies llc great thanks and good evening hoping you might be able to just give a little incremental color on the enhanced yield product where you see the sort of demand coming for that and what the potential kind of rates might be that could be offered to clients thanks raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah if you look at i think almost everyone has offered enhanced yield programs today theyre not new we just havent had a need for them because of the amount of client cash weve had as that dwindles more and just even as a defensive mechanism we will offer them and thats the account whether people have money markets and want an insured product which we have or if people are thinking of moving their money they have a competitive yield without moving their money into sweeps i mean into money markets or fixed income products or things so thats really a number of firms in the industry have primarily been relying on that we havent because of the cost of funds but as weve had were reaching an area where weve always said that if we get to this area well offer some of those products the competitive rates in todays market are probably between it would cut some outliers on either side but thats the cost and what our competitors have been doing and to the point that were going to make sure were always on the positive side of cash good news is even at those much higher rates we can still earn a spread and also since we really have all low yield deposits and almost virtually zero highcost deposits adding some will just be it wont be as big of an impact on our cost of funds as most places have significant deposits today gerald edward ohara q analyst jefferies llc great thanks and then maybe one just on the recruiting environment is there anything seasonal kind of about turning the calendar that would be sort of advantageous as it relates to kind of attracting and recruiting advisers and perhaps if you could also just kind of touch on just any of the dynamics around transition assistance and what youre kind of seeing in the marketplace thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah thank you i mean for years everybody said well we hear its competitive its been competitive a long time it continues to be competitive i would say that the competitive environments about the same id say the only new in the last year is there are some thirdparty ria aggregators that have paid more than the other firms competing for people in the adviser space but we are at a very strong backlog last year our employee division led the way and set its own record and our independent division was a little slower in the first quarter the independents recruiting faster and the employee a little slower i mean through one quarter but what we see is the backlogs very very strong in both division very large teams so we still feel good about the recruiting and its if you just look at the last few years i think weve been right up at the top of the charts on net new assets and recruiting paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc gerry any other question gerald edward ohara q analyst jefferies llc no good for me thanks gentlemen raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc all right thanks gerry operator and the next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed with your question manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good afternoon paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey manan paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc hey manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to ask a question on cash sorting can you comment on the broader trends in cash sorting were sort of getting closer to that of client assets that has been a lower end of the range in the past so is that still a good base for where cash should settle and how quickly do you think well get there paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc i think the true answer is no one really knows that number was based on that to period so we dont have a lot of as a industry a lot of great historical benchmarking because of course even in that to period the fed funds target topped out at and so arguably client sensitivity around rate is heightened when youre at todays fed fund target rate and the yields that you can earn on your investable cash balances so is good a guess as any but were certainly not hanging our hat on that potentially being a floor which is why as paul says we are looking at all the diversified sources of funding that we can offer our clients that would be attractive to our clients and also gives us additional appreciation of the tristate capital franchise because they have a independent and diversified funding source as well paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i dont think we try to figure out where the bottoms are when tristate joined us and we talked about diversified funding i think a lot of people said well why are you even bringing that up youve got record cash deposits well we always anticipate these time frames and just in where we started ready to roll out some higher yielding products because no one wanted cash all of a sudden we got flooded with cash again overnight so we know these dynamics can change and change rapidly raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 and so cash sorting as we reported has continued whether 5s the bottom or it goes a little lower dont know a lot of the lower balance deposits which are significant have been very very steady so at some point the higher deposits will probably find a home where its material enough at todays rates to make a difference and the lower just like bank accounts its not enough to make a change so were just we always prepare and fear the worst but generally because you just dont know so i wish i hope is the bottom but well see and well be prepared if it wasnt manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay great and then in terms of deposits you noted youre allocating more deposits to the bank rather than a thirdparty bank program so is there a specific loantodeposit ratio or liquidity level that youre thinking about maintaining at the bank and how should we think about this going forward if cash sorting continues at the same rate paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah the biggest constraint on that is just sort of the percentage of bdp sweep deposits that we want in our own bank because we always wanted there to be a cushion of balances that are swept to thirdparty banks in case balances as paul said do decline more rapidly than we expect so thats really kind of the governing factor its roughly at today in terms of the amount of the bdp sweep cash that is going to our own banks maybe it will go a little bit higher than that i mean of the billion to billion of cash with thirdparty banks today a good portion of that could be swept over to our own bank while still preserving clients fdic insurance that we offer them which is bestinclass in the industry by the way as far as we can tell but we also want to make sure were being prudent and not exposing ourselves to funding risk by shifting too much over paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah we have plenty of capital and liquidity so our first source is to fund the banks thats our business and then to the extent is the sweep is really a cash overflow in a lot of ways but a good part of our business model so right now were not alarmed we still have flexibility but at some point weve known people that have gone up to of cash or something we just thats a little too leveraged for us operator and the next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please proceed with your question alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi guys good evening thanks for the question just apologies for a twoparter but it is related so im hoping to just better understand the balance sheet strategy for you guys from here so on the one hand paul you talked about slowing loan growth in this environment and then at the same time youre talking about launching an enhanced yield product on the deposit side despite the fact that you have lots of liquidity in thirdparty bank deposits ph still so maybe help me understand how much of that billion thirdparty bank is ultimately sweepable to your bank how big the enhanced yield program you think ultimately will be for you guys over the next months and how are you thinking about the overall growth at the bank in terms of the growth in assets raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah so the growth ultimately the growth in the bank is driven by client demand right and so as paul said in his prepared remarks that client demand is experiencing headwinds now that interest rates are on the move as you would expect until they get used to the new normal of interest rates we expect those headwinds to continue but one thing we will not do is when client demand does slow down naturally given the rate environment today were not going to stretch for growth or get into asset classes that are not really clientoriented with that being said in terms of the funding we always want to prepare for the future one quarter is certainly not a trend and so we want to be there for our clients whether its a year to two to five years out from now and so we want to make sure that were diversifying our and strengthening our funding sources so that we have the ample funding for when client demand does come back because we know it will eventually come back we just dont know when or how quickly it will be so thats sort of how we think about the strategy so longterm strategy versus trying to manage it quartertoquarter paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think in terms of the amount is we dont know so what you do is you turn on the program start raising money and you can always accelerate it by letting more clients know pushing it more changing the rate in the competitive market i mean you have lots of levers to speed it up you certainly can slow it down or you can stop it so but you cant do any of those unless you start it so we have the technology up and running weve got it tested and now were going to go out and open it up to a degree and if we need it more well spread it out to a broader base of the adviser segments and if it ends up being more than we need and we see cash goes the other way well slow it down or turn it off so its about being prepared and its the same in tristate it has thirdparty sources too and weve said just prepare to turn them on make sure theyre there get interest and then if we need them we could be more aggressive if we dont we could just stop so its just a balance paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc if we dont have much cash indiscernible paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc we need yeah if we dont have much cash i mean wed tell you and we know how much wed have to raise but we always assume we can run models and speculate but we the truth is we really dont know so we just need to be able to react to it operator and the next question comes from the line of bill katz with credit suisse please proceed with your question bill katz q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 okay thank you very much for taking the questions and also appreciate you moving back the conference call to tonight just following up on ph so this last line of questioning as you think about earning asset growth a can you grow that in an environment where there are sorting and mixed loan demand and b if it does grow could you talk a little bit about the sort of decisionmaking between loan growth and the investment securities portfolio thank you paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc again right now in a tighter funding environment and more uncertain funding environment we are certainly prioritizing client demand and client funding needs over the securities portfolio just like we prioritized the security portfolio when we needed to accommodate surplus client cash balances again our balance sheets primarily there for clients and thats how we thats kind of a difference between how we think about our balance sheet and many of our peers is that we really do think about the client demand both on the asset and on the funding side so yeah in terms of the loan growth going forward as paul says we really dont know what its going to be what were not going to do is force or stretch for growth but we will continue to provide have our advisers provide excellent advice for their clients and to the extent that theyre need mortgages or securitiesbased loans or our corporate clients reengage in ma and they need financing then we want to be there for them bill katz q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc okay and then just a followup maybe switch back to capital for a moment obviously you said a pretty strong capital position as you both have mentioned can you update us on what your latest thinking is on where youd like to have that tier leverage ratio settle out and i think youve mentioned a couple times of opportunities to deploy your capital will you be able to buy back would you buy back the full billion or is it a function of potential ma and if youre interested in ma where might you be looking thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so yeah let me go backwards into the question first we like organic growth the best its been our focus because its sustained its large consistent net new assets even when were not doing acquisitions in the pcg space were still growing but we like acquisitions for the right targets and we cant tell if and when those would happen i think the last few years people doubted if we were serious and we closed three deals pretty quickly so our goals right now in our balance sheet we gave a tier target of were still at that target its gone up faster good news is part of thats earnings but the other reason is just really the shrinking of the corporate balance sheet too as cash has come off the balance sheet that ratio went up without really a lot of changes were still committed to it were committed to the billion target as paul mentioned in his remarks that we want to do with billion this year we got partially there this quarter and we know we have to get more aggressive to hit that but were thats our plans in terms of other capital well always say if the great acquisition showed up tomorrow and it required a lot of capital would we use it instead of buybacks possibly is this accretive advantaged dont have one so i dont theoretical question but if it did well always balance whats the best use of the capital but our plans right now is to focus on our commitment to hit that billion target raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 operator and the next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport capital please proceed with your question jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good afternoon guys paul maybe on just the nii thoughts if you think about average fed funds could be up if you look at the forward curve could be up close to basis points in the first quarter versus the fourth but then you have sort of this mix shift in deposits you have higher spot nim going into the first quarter so how do we think about nim and nii in the first quarter and how youre thinking about the trajectory you kind of mentioned you want to grow nii can you do that consistently or do we should we expect the negative mix shift starts to hurt nii growth after just trying to think there whether its or full year or whatever you want to want to give us paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc obviously theres jim a lot of variables that kind of go into that but as we look into our fiscal second quarter i mean were entering in with a spot rate of for the banks nim for the bank segment and so thats before any additional benefit from further rate hikes potentially and so and we have grown the banks portfolio up their assets have grown sequentially so netnet when you sort of think about the fact that theres two fewer days in the second quarter than the first quarter we still believe we will be able to grow net interest income overall in the second quarter and that may that will likely be offset by a decline partially offset by a decline in the bdp fees just because the balances are down probably the average balances sequentially will probably be down to as weve put up a greater proportion of the funds to the bank segment but again well have a higher spread on those balances were entering in with a spot rate of versus the average yield that we earned during the quarter first quarter of paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think also is wed have to really hustle on raising highcost deposits which indiscernible significant enough to have a huge impact on that number in the shorter term but obviously if the cash dynamic and sorting continues that will start impacting as we raise so well just have to see how that goes jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right okay and maybe just as a followup on admin comp and pcg was up i think yearoveryear sequentially is that a new run rate or is there some intersegment because i did notice that the comp and benefits line in corporateother was down 20plus percent was there some kind of shifting of those kind of costs among segments or is that just a higher upward pressure in that line paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah jim i would tell you that the first quarter comparisons to the fourth quarter are always a little bit noisy just because in the fourth quarter were always trying to adjust the bonus and benefit accruals to reflect the actual results for the fiscal year and then we sort of reset those accruals in the first quarter so i think last year at this time it was like an increase in pcg admin comp as an example raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 so theres some theres a lot of noise comparing the sequential yearoveryear of course we have acquisitions we have the charles stanley acquisition for the full quarter this year in pcg as well as just kind of overall growth of the business in the pcg business with that being said in the second quarter we do have the impact of the payroll tax reset as we enter the beginning of the calendar year and then we also will see the impact of the salary increases that have become effective on january and those salary increases this year were significant as we always have done we always want to share in the success of the firm with our associates who make that success possible and particularly in this inflationary environment given our record results in the fiscal year we did we were generous in passing on salary increases to our associates and that will be reflected fully in the second quarter operator and the next question comes from the line of kyle voigt with kbw please proceed with your question kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good evening indiscernible question just given the forward curve and market expectations now for the fed to begin cutting by yearend and into i was wondering if you could help us think about deposit betas through a declining fed funds environment and i think during the last rate cycle the adjustments on yields are the betas on the way down for the first few cuts in are relatively high and help support the bank nim i guess is it fair to look back towards that last cycle as a good guide for how you would kind of manage your deposit rates this cycle as well paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yes were still having a hard time being exactly right on what the deposit betas are in this upcycle so certainly trying to predict what it will be in a different cycle is very difficult to do itd be based on the competitive environment and a lot of other dynamics that apply at the time for example in the last rate cycle we had surges in cash balances because it was due to the pandemic and so when rates were cut we obviously did not have a funding need per se we actually had cash so we have to figure out how to place that may not be the case next time rates decrease i dont think you can compare different cycles just because each one is so unique so most people are sort of guessing that the deposit betas on the way down will be symmetrical to what theyve been on the way up i guess thats a good guess but we really dont know kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you and then just maybe a followup just on the net loan growth in the quarter just wondering if you could help us understand some of the dynamics by loan bucket and i know well see some more infills within the q but it looks like demand for sbl has been a bit weaker and so it looks like youre seeing decent demand for mortgages even with the tough backdrop so just given the rest of this year this fiscal year i guess where should we expect more of the loan growth to really come from and should we kind of expect that slower sbl demand to persist near term paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 yeah we actually do provide the linebyline endofperiod loans in the supplement so its kind of buried in there i know we provide a lot of materials but there is some more detail there but you are right the sbl balances declined sequentially and that was due to frankly a lot of repayments as the interest rates went up dramatically over the last three to six months on those lines and so residential mortgages went up but a lot of that was due to mortgages that were in process even before the quarter as you know mortgages take a while to go through the underwriting and closing process so as we said earlier we dont know really what the dynamic is going to look like going forward its going to be based on client demand we do expect until the rates settle out and clients get used to whatever the new norm is we do expect headwinds for growth across all loan categories both floating and fixed really because the fixed coupons are up as well although we dont do much in the way of fixed but certainly mortgages is a category that borrowers are still getting used to to across the industry when it was just to a yearanda half ago so it is a pretty dramatic change in a pretty short period of time kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc indiscernible thank you operator and the next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please proceed with your question brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good afternoon thank you for taking my questions i know youve touched on this a couple of times but im still a little confused and so id love to ask a followup paul shoukry you speak about the liquidity in the balance sheet often and we can certainly see your liquidity on the asset side and so i guess im not clear as to why what the impulse is to raise higher cost funding through this enhanced yield program when you could you simply allow for some of the assets to run off especially the stuff thats easily replaceable like securities so could you maybe clarify that for me and then also weve seen some competitors going to similar products in the last few quarters and that has led to a pretty strong mix shift in favor of the higher cost funding do you have any estimates or any rough idea about how much mix shift to that type youll see in your own deposit base paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc yeah so to your point brennan we are kind of continuing to let the securities portfolio run off a lot of that growth over the last two years is really accommodating client cash balances on the balance sheet and so we really built that up well beyond our liquidity targets at raymond james bank so the answer is really kind of all of the above when it comes to funding were doing that were also as paul said making sure that were prepared on many other fronts when it comes to funding the enhanced yield savings were starting with a relatively small amount relative to our overall funding needs but the point that paul was bringing up is that we just want to make sure that we have all of these sources turned on and make sure that theyre working so we understand what the ability capabilities are the demand is et cetera we learn from it and then to the extent that we need to drive more balances through various levers then we have the ability to do that but its hard to do that if you dont have it even turned on raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i dont know of other institutions that dont have cds enhanced wealth theyve been aggressively raising money because of our floating rate balance sheet and our unusually high liquidity in both on our balance sheet and client cash we havent had to and thats been part of whats driven a lot of the earnings but we could assume that well have enough indiscernible last forever or we can start the programs in case they continue to run off more than the industry expects and well still be wellfunded so the reason were starting it is just in case and if we need more well accelerate it so it wouldnt be prudent to wait until all of a sudden we really need it and we dont have any of the programs in place most theres many other firms that have needed it and theyve been very aggressive because they didnt have that flexibility weve had the flexibility but were certainly going to as we always we look to the long term and were going to have it in place and ready to go and the only way you know you have it in place is when youre executing it and actually collecting deposits and everything is working well and then you dial it up or you dial it back if you need it so paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc and the only other thing i would add is theres so much concern around mix shift as there understandably so but its not like the cash isnt moving we have the best purchase money market fund platform in the industry as far as i can tell its institutional shared classes offered to any size client and so its not like the cash is moving to other higheryielding destinations as it should and the financial advisers help their clients with those type of decisions so to the extent that we can offer an attractive product on balance sheet that meet clients needs some are still concerned about money market funds frankly because they didnt perform very well in the last couple of cycles so we have to offer an fdicinsured product which keeps the funding on the balance sheet and actually earns a better spread than if it goes into some of those other products could be a winwin so thats kind of how were looking at it as well brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah sure totally get you on the substitutes being broadly available and any sense of your expectations for magnitude of how big this program could be paul shoukry a chief financial officer raymond james financial inc no because it really frankly depends on the levers that we pull right we have levers around the rate we offer the size the count that we limited to the size of the deposit et cetera so as paul said most of our competitors have already come out with it and had to be aggressive because in the last couple of years they deployed almost all of their deposits to fund balance sheet growth we always said and we took a lot of criticism for it a year or so ago that we wanted to keep that cash very flexible and so we dont have the same acute pressures on funding that they have had over the past six months and so were able to be more deliberate in sort of figuring out the right balance for clients and for the firm operator and the final question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please proceed with your question raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi thanks so much for squeezing me in here i just had one final question on capital markets and more specifically the profitability or i guess like theyre up in the quarter i recognize one quarter indiscernible you did incur the pretax loss in the segment what i wanted to better understand is given the lack of complex that we saw within the segment itself how youre thinking about managing expenses and comp if you remain in a challenging investment banking backdrop its a question were getting quite a lot because the pretax margin was strong for the firm the comp ratio was certainly wellmanaged for the firm overall and at the same time you didnt get the positive comp leverage this quarter and much of that was obscured by cap market so any insight you could provide there would be really helpful paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yes so i mean the capital markets have been difficult for everyone and the part of theres a couple of factors one it didnt have a good quarter but secondly compared to a lot of other firms we dont have any unallocated overhead so there are other firms that certainly had lower results but every penny of overhead is allocated to a segment so you see a fully loaded pl and its not the case in a lot of other firms who if they had might have a little bit of a different answer or closer answer it was an off quarter due to first both ma and we all know whats happening with that slowdown and with underwriting and the fixed income business again we talked about the cash dynamic at thirdparty banks so it was challenging so well do what we always do first we have a very variable comp structure that our bonuses our basis although we raised them are still lower than a lot of places and we as we did two years ago right we took big pay cuts you could see them even through the executives the year before this year so we have a variable comp structure well take care of that and then well have to just look at the business and make whatever adjustments in those businesses we have to the good news is corporately were actually weve been very conservative although weve hired a lot of people we have a lot of open positions and were just being less aggressive with hiring and making sure we keep the people we need through these cycles so we dont go in like the tech companies way overloaded and i think in capital markets theyre just going to have to look at what businesses are there and what support they need to make those decisions so i dont but certainly we dont plan any sizable layoff programs that youve read in other firms steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats it for me thanks so much for taking my question paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you all right operator and there are no further questions raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2023 paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc great well thank you very much thanks for joining us and again just overall i dont think too many people are showing record net income to shareholders this quarter but i think its a testament to the model and but theres a lot of uncertainties going forward we all know it we all knew the questions youd ask and were committed on the capital repurchases with the only contingency if something comes up that we think can drive more shareholder value and on the cash and cash sorting good questions we could run models and give you answers based on them but our experiences they all vary from that so were just were going to raise as much cash as we need to support the business and not raise it if we dont need it and so far that served us well so appreciate you joining the call and talk soon operator that does conclude todays conference we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines disclaimer the
