to turn the call over to chair and ceo paul reilly paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good morning and thank you for joining us today i know with our recent acquisitions the numbers are a little more complicated but i am pleased with our results for the fiscal third quarter and the first nine months of the fiscal year despite challenging market conditions we have continued to invest in our business our people and technology to help drive growth across all of our businesses in the private client group excellent retention and recruiting of financial advisors contributed to industryleading growth with domestic net new assets of over the trailing 12month period in the capital markets business while investment banking revenues were negatively impacted by continued market volatility during the quarter we continue to see strong pipelines as the expertise we have added both organically and through niche acquisitions has performed very well in fixed income we completed the acquisition of sumridge partners just after the quarter on july which will enhance our platform with technologydriven capabilities and a fantastic team with extensive experience in dealing with corporates in june we completed the acquisition of tristate capital holdings including tristate capital bank and chartwell investment partners adding billion of loans and billion in financial assets under management in addition to tristates contribution to our loan portfolio raymond james bank grew loans at an impressive during the quarter reflecting attractive growth across almost all loan categories so as we always do in any market cycle we continue to invest for the longterm always putting the client first and while the decrease in feebased assets from the equity market declines during the quarter will negatively impact asset management and related administrative fees in the fourth quarter we are wellpositioned for increases in the shortterm rates given our attractive growth of earning assets the majority of which floats with the short end of the curve furthermore we have maintained a flexible balance sheet with solid capital ratios well in excess of regulatory requirements raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 turning to results on slide i fully appreciate there were a lot of moving parts this quarter which paul shoukry will explain in more detail in the fiscal third quarter the firm reported net revenues of billion and net income available to common shareholders of million or earnings per diluted share of yearoveryear and sequential revenue growth reflects primarily the benefit of higher shortterm interest rates on both rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks and net interest income which more than offset the declines in total brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues resulting from the challenging market environment the decline in net income available to common shareholders was primarily attributable to increased business development expenses and a higher bank loan provision for credit losses during the current quarter which reflects the strong growth at raymond james bank a weaker macroeconomic outlook and the million initial provision for the credit losses on loans acquired from tristate capital bank as paul will discuss in more detail excluding million of expenses related to acquisitions quarterly adjusted net income available to common shareholders was million or per diluted share annualized return on equity for the quarter was and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was an impressive result especially given the challenging market environment and our strong capital position moving to slide sharp equity market declines in the quarter including a sequential decline in the sp index negatively impacted client asset levels we ended the quarter with the total client assets under administration of trillion and pcg assets in feebased accounts of billion financial assets under management of billion which includes chartwell investment partners decreased sequentially as a decline in equity markets more than offset net inflows in the acquired assets during the quarter we ended the quarter with financial advisors a net increase of over the prioryear period and a decrease of compared to the preceding quarter results this quarter reflect the transfer of advisors primarily from one firm to our ria custody services division or rcs during the quarter while transfers to rcs impact the advisor count the client assets typically remain custodied at the firm excluding these transfers the number of financial advisors increased from the preceding quarter reflecting our continued low regrettable attrition and strong recruiting our focus on supporting advisors and their clients especially during volatile markets has led to strong results in terms of advisor retention as well as our recruiting of experienced advisors to the raymond james platforms through our multiple affiliation options over the trailing 12month period ending june we recruited to our domestic independent contract and employee channels financial advisors with approximately million of trailing 12month production and approximately billion of client assets at their previous firms and highlighting our industryleading growth we generated domestic pcg net new assets of nearly billion over the four quarters ending june representing of domestic pcg assets at the beginning of the period third quarter domestic pcg net new asset growth was annualized a strong result given the impact of client tax payments in the quarter bank loan growth continues to be strong raymond james bank generated impressive loan growth of year overyear and sequentially to a record billion additionally tristate capital bank brought over billion of loans this quarter which represents a record for them as they have continued to generate very attractive loan growth across their portfolios raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 moving on to segment results on slide the private client group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million while assetbased revenues declined the segment results were lifted by the benefit from higher shortterm interest rates the capital markets segment generated quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million capital markets revenues declined over the prioryear period and sequentially mostly driven by lower fixed income brokerage revenues and equity underwriting revenues due to the volatile and uncertain markets the asset management segment generated net revenues of million and pretax income of million the sequential decline in revenues and pretax income in the asset management segment were primarily attributable to the negative impact on financial assets under management from the decline in equity markets the bank segment which now includes raymond james bank and tristate capital bank generated quarterly net revenues of million which is a record result and pretax income of million remember we closed on tristate capital on june so this quarter only reflects one month of their results net revenue growth was mainly due to higher loan balances and significant expansion of the banks net interest margin to for the quarter up basis points from the preceding quarter despite revenue growth the banks segments pretax income declined primarily due to the aforementioned higher bank loan loss provisions in the quarter looking at the fiscal yeartodate results on slide we generated record net revenues of billion during the first nine months of fiscal up over the same period a year ago record earnings per diluted share of increased compared to the first nine months of fiscal additionally we generated strong annualized return on common equity of and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of for the ninemonth period moving to the fiscal yeartodate segment results on slide all four core operating segments generated record net revenues and the private client group capital markets and asset management segments generated record pretax income during the first nine months of the fiscal year again reinforcing the value of our diverse and complementary businesses and now for a more detailed view of the third quarter and yeartodate results i will turn the call over to paul shoukry paul paul shoukry chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thank you paul starting with consolidated revenues on slide quarterly net revenues of billion grew yearoveryear and sequentially asset management fees grew over the prior years fiscal third quarter and declined compared to the preceding quarter in line with the guidance we provided on last quarters call as a result of the steep declines in the equity markets during the quarter private client group assets and fee based accounts ended the fiscal third quarter down compared to march creating a significant headwind for asset management revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter brokerage revenues of million declined compared to the prior years fiscal third quarter and compared to the preceding quarter the decline in brokerage revenues was largely due to lower assetbased trail revenues in the private client group as well as decreased brokerage revenues in the capital markets segment raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 i know some other financial services firms posted yearoveryear increases in institutional fixed income brokerage revenues but remember we intentionally do not have a meaningful presence in the much more volatile interest rate commodities in currency trading businesses which benefited many of those larger firms this quarter ill discuss account and service fees net interest income shortly investment banking revenues of million declined compared to the preceding quarter while our pipelines are strong there is a lot of uncertainty given the heightened market volatility given the market environment we are really pleased with the investment banking result this quarter and our best guess right now is that we could achieve a similar result in the fiscal fourth quarter if the markets remain relatively resilient over the next couple of months moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at billion down compared to the preceding quarter and representing of domestic pcg client assets as of this week these balances have declined to approximately billion reflecting the quarterly fee payments which were paid in july and comprised of roughly half their decline this month as well as some continued cash sorting activity during the month turning to slide combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks was million up an astounding over the prior years fiscal third quarter and from the preceding quarter this revenue growth is largely a result of higher loan balances in the bank segment as well as higher shortterm interest rates which really reinforces our longstanding approach of taking limited duration risk with a high concentration of floating rate assets you can see on the bottomleft portion of the slide the banks segments net interest margin increased a substantial basis points sequentially to for the quarter the average yield on rjbdp balances with thirdparty banks increased to basis points in the quarter both the nim and the average yield from thirdparty banks are expected to increase further from the recent and anticipated rate increases for the fiscal fourth quarter factoring in the rate increase this week and some assumptions around deposit beta and other variables we would expect the average yield on rjbdp from thirdparty banks for the fiscal fourth quarter to average around as for the banks segments nim we expect it to average around for the fiscal fourth quarter which would reflect around two months of this weeks interest rate increase and a full quarter of tristate capitals contribution but these projections will obviously be impacted by the actual deposit beta we experience we will continue to put clients first and focus on staying on the more generous end of the spectrum for our clients so far our cumulative deposit betas since the fed start increasing rates in march has been around but that has accelerated with each subsequent increase to about with the june increase we would expect the deposit beta to continue increasing with each incremental rate increase moving to consolidated expenses on slide let me point out a significant change we made this quarter to our presentation of expenses namely we eliminated the acquisitionrelated expense line item and now are including all the expenses in their respective line items at the same time we are now capturing more acquisitionrelated expenses in our nongaap adjustments including items such as amortization of acquired identified intangible assets acquisitionrelated retention and a bank loan provision item i will discuss in more detail shortly for example this quarter million of expenses related to acquisitions are included in the nongaap adjustments as detailed on the reconciliation table on slide which provides the amount of associated expense raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 per line item as well as a fivequarter history we hope these refinements which i know have been very common across many of our peers are responsive to many of your requests and helps you gain a better understanding of our operating results and as always we will emphasize our gaap results alongside any adjusted results we disclose so turning to our largest expense compensation the total compensation ratio for the quarter was which decreased from in the preceding quarter we also introduced an adjusted total compensation ratio this quarter which adjusts for acquisitionrelated retention and compensation as outlined on the slide the adjusted compensation ratio was during the quarter the sequential decline in the compensation ratio largely reflects the benefit from higher net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks noncompensation expenses of million which includes million of acquisitionrelated expenses included in our nongaap earnings adjustments increased sequentially business development expenses increased to million reflecting the advisor recognition events and conferences as well as increased pentup travel during the quarter to put this in perspective prior to covid the fiscal third quarter was typically the high watermark for this line item and in the fiscal third quarters of both and this line item totaled million and since then our business and revenues have grown substantially including through several acquisitions the bank loan provision for credit losses increased considerably to million a big portion of this increase was a million initial provision associated with tristate capital acquisition where purchase accounting requires us to establish an initial allowance for loan losses associated with the acquired loans as the preclosing allowance does not transfer over to help you with comparability to prior periods we did adjust for this portion of the bank loan provision in our non gaap results the remaining portion of the bank loan provision during the quarter around million was primarily associated with the sequential loan growth at raymond james bank and a weaker macroeconomic outlook other expenses increased to million for the quarter the majority of the sequential increase was attributable to increased expenses associated with acquisitions during the quarter which are included in the nongaap adjustments so i know there has been a lot of noise over the past couple of quarters with the charles stanley and tristate capital acquisitions but the main takeaway on expenses is we remain focused on the disciplined manage of all compensation and noncompensation related expenses while still investing heavily in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters in the fiscal third quarter we generated a pre tax margin of and an adjusted pretax margin of while the market environment has certainly become more challenging since our analyst investor day in may we still believe the to pretax margin target we laid out is appropriate given the significant benefits of higher shortterm interest rates assuming the market stays relatively resilient at current levels on slide at the end of the quarter total assets were billion an sequential increase reflecting the addition of tristate capital as well as solid growth of loans at raymond james bank liquidity and capital remained very strong rjf corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at billion well above the billion raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 target the tier leverage ratio of and the total capital ratio of are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be wellcapitalized providing significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth also i would note that the tier leverage ratio includes just one month of tristate capital assets and doesnt yet reflect the assets from sumridge which closed on july so the spot tier leverage ratio following the sumridge acquisition is below still well above the regulatory requirement and as i said on the last quarters call we dont view the client cash were accommodating on the balance sheet at the brokerdealer and the client interest program which ended the quarter at billion the same as our other balance sheet assets so we still have ample balance sheet flexibility after adjusting for those excess cash balances on the balance sheet i am very pleased with the progress we have made deploying capital over the past two years since we first disclosed our capital targets really reinforcing our priority to utilize capital to invest in longterm growth across all of our businesses and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders the effective tax rate for the quarter increased to up from in the preceding quarter primarily due to higher nondeductible losses on the corporateowned life insurance portfolio slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters following the closing of the tristate acquisition on june we began repurchasing common shares under our board authorization we repurchased approximately million common shares for million or approximately per share as of july approximately million remained available under the board approved share repurchase authorization as we explained on prior calls and at analyst investor day in may our current plan is to offset the share issuance associated with the acquisition of tristate over the next few quarters and i believe our action in june demonstrates this commitment but we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and other capital needs as we evaluate further repurchases over the coming quarters lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment and remember these metrics reflect our newly formed bank segments which includes raymond james bank and tristate capital bank the credit quality of the loan portfolio remains strong and most trends continue to improve criticized loans as a percent of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at down from at june and at march so now ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul as i said at the start of our call im pleased with our results and while there are many uncertainties i believe we are wellpositioned to drive growth across all of our businesses in the private client group next quarter results will be negatively impacted by the expected sequential decline of asset management and related administrative fees that paul described earlier however focusing more longterm our recruiting pipelines remain strong and combined with solid retention im optimistic we will continue to deliver industryleading growth as advisors are attracted to our clientfocused values and leading technology platform the segment will also continue to benefit from higher shortterm interest rates raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 in the capital markets segment the ma pipeline remains robust but the pace and timing of closings will heavily be influenced on market conditions over the longterm i am confident we are wellpositioned for growth as the significant investments we made over the past five years indiscernible our platform and increased our team and productive capacity in the fixed income space we expect sumridge partners to enhance our current position in the rapidlyevolving fixed income and trading technology marketplace in the asset management segment while financial assets under management are starting the fiscal fourth quarter lower due to equity markets we are confident the strong growth of assets in feebased accounts in the private client group segment will drive longterm growth of financial assets under management in addition we expect carillon tower advisers with its new addition of chartwell investment partners to help drive further growth through increased scale distribution and operational and marketing synergies and the bank segment is well positioned for rising shortterm interest rates as we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet prudently and most importantly the credit quality of the banks segments loan portfolio remains strong as always i want to thank our advisors and all of our associates for their perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day with that operator im going to open it up for questions thank you question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions the first question comes from jerry ohara of jefferies please go ahead gerald edward ohara q analyst jefferies llc great thanks and good morning i was hoping you might be able to just help to unpack a little bit of the comments around the cash sorting in the quarter and just sort of maybe give us a sense of what you saw and perhaps what we might expect in that dynamic thank you paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thanks jerry how are you good morning yeah actually the cash balances in the quarter stayed relatively resilient as you saw was only down about for the quarter now in the month of july we have seen a decline in client cash balances were at about billion now almost half of that was from the quarterly fee billings which all come up in the first month of the quarter and then the other portion kind of reflects the cash sorting that weve been expecting for quite some time now as rates start to increase and just to put it into context just a year ago we were at billion of total client cash balances which were elevated from the precovid days so i dont think it should be surprising to see some cash sorting as rates increase going forward raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 gerald edward ohara q analyst jefferies llc great thanks and then maybe just a followup on expenses paul appreciate the sort of commentary around the growth of the business and the quarter being typically something of a high watermark but can you maybe help us just sort of think about how that might trend on a run rate basis over the next couple of quarters given obviously sort of increased te and some of the other sort of normalization expense pressures that were seeing apologies if i missed it but i think thatd be helpful paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah certainly business development expenses were much higher this quarter last quarter it seems like an eternity but we were still dealing with omicron so people really werent traveling at the beginning of the quarter this quarter we have our biggest advisor conference for the independent advisor business so we that and this is a quarter weve had it historically even precovid which is why it usually is the high watermark quarter and people are starting to travel again theres a lot of pentup travel out there of people wanting to see each other in person again so i think when you look at just stepping back and looking at noncompensation expense in the aggregate on a gaap basis it ended at million for the quarter now about million of that were nongaap adjustments related to acquisitions so that gets us down to on an adjusted basis for nongaap a noncompensation expenses about million we still have two more months of tristate capital to reflect there so thats about million if you look at their million run rate but some of the expenses this quarter were elevated so may be a good sort of jumping off point plus or minus a few million dollars as we look at the next couple of quarters paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i know the line item was higher than people maybe anticipated but i think you also have to remember if you compare it to the and numbers that was about of revenue in that quarter its about of revenue this time i mean so weve grown significantly i think were managing the costs very well so just based on those percentages i dont think were back to where we were you can see were managing expenses but our big conferences and our biggest advisor events have occurred in this quarter so its not atypical so gerald edward ohara q analyst jefferies llc understood thanks for taking my questions this morning paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thanks jerry operator thank you the next question comes from alex blostein of goldman sachs please go ahead michael vinci q analyst goldman sachs raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 hey guys this is michael on for alex so i think we kind of want an update on the timing and size of how youre thinking about swapping tscs deposits with rjfs deposits any updated color you can give us there would be great thanks paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc first ill let paul talk about that but i think you guys we can deploy cash in either bank and its really almost irrelevant whether its in tristate or raymond james bank versus the sweep so we have a lot of options and flexibility to maximize the earnings on cash as banks are looking for bank sweeps again where they werent before so its a question i know you all keep asking weve already made some progress on that but part of it really depends on tristates clients theyre operating for their clients and they have depository relationships there too but were making progress and paul ill let you get into a little more of the detail but i think strategically as you go forward you should look at how much is deployed and not necessarily in which franchise so paul paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc i think you covered it very well paul and weve already supplemented their deposit base with about billion of our deposits and we have plans to supplement with another billion but as paul said theyre running an independent business they have their clients we want to certainly honor their relationships with their clients and frankly over the next few years those deposits and those diversified funding sources could be very valuable to us as an organization overall so were not focused on the shortterm accretion of a standalone business were really focused on maximizing flexibility and earnings for the organization overall michael vinci q analyst goldman sachs great thanks so it sounds like the kind of initial commentary you guys gave when the acquisition was closed is kind of what we can still expect paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc id say the trend is that way right so i guess we could change based on where we can deploy the cash and what they need but so far were on the kind of the plan michael vinci q analyst goldman sachs all right great and then maybe one quick followup you guys gave us the guidance for the fiscal fourth firm wide nim maybe you can help us think about like a good jumping off point for nii and flush that out a little bit thanks paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 yeah i mean we gave you kind of the biggest component with the nim average for the quarter for the fiscal fourth quarter were expecting it to be about which would be almost basis points higher than the that it averaged this particular quarter so and weve had some nice growth in earning assets both from raymond james bank on a standalone basis which grew sequentially and then of course adding on tristate so i think those kind of give you the main inputs to calculating net interest income and then the bdp fees which are substantial as well they averaged basis points this quarter the cash had swept over to thirdparty banks and we said that with the rate increase that was announced yesterday and some assumptions around deposit beta that we expect that to increase to on average for next quarter so really significant tailwinds coming from net interest income in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks and i think the important thing here is weve been criticized for quite some time for not taking more duration i know a lot of our peers have done that but our longstanding approach of staying flexible and not trying to time the rates to the markets and the bond curves is going to serve us very well in this rising rate environment michael vinci q analyst goldman sachs great thank you guys operator thank you the next question comes from steven chubak of wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey paul since you ended on that response talking about your decision to manage the bank in such a way where you have more shortend gearing i know thats serving you quite well certainly in this upcoming tightening cycle at the same time the market is starting to price in rate cuts beginning in and in the last fed easing cycle the decision to maintain that sensitivity did create a fair amount of earnings volatility you cited some peers that have overextended themselves taking on too much duration i happen to agree with that statement and i think that theyre getting punished as a result in this type of environment but there is also a balance that could be struck where you maintain some healthy mix of fixed versus floating rate assets curious if thats something youd be amenable to protect that earnings or nii downside if and when the fed begins easing paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah steven you remember this well because youre very close to it we had no securities at all on the banks balance sheet and so we do we have been more balanced and diversified in that regard and i think we plan on continuing to be more balanced and diversified but almost all of our deposits are floating rate deposits so to take on much more duration would essentially be making a bet between and a mismatch between the assets and the deposits so our focus is to to your point be more diversified and we are much more diversified than we were just five or six years ago with our securities portfolio and we also have jumbo mortgages on the balance sheet that has some duration to it tax exempt loans et cetera but we will i think you should expect us to continue to be more exposed to the shortend of the curve just given the nature of our deposit base which is floating steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 no really helpful color paul and for my followup just on some of the deposit beta commentary if i think about how you guys manage deposit cost last cycle youre trending more in line with the industry in terms of overall beta so far youve been running a little bit ahead of peers i believe the word that you used on the call was youd be generous with deposit rates what beta should we be modeling beyond the fiscal third quarter and whats driving the decision to be more competitive on pricing this cycle is that reflective of some of the cash sorting headwinds you cited or something else paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i just think that look we knew a bunch of rate increases were coming right so and a lot of people you can take to a process you can maximize your return but our belief when everybody was talking about how much cash and there was too much cash is that as businesses grew and rates went up and you can see whats happened in the public markets where people havent had access there would be more demand for cash and were seeing that in the bank sweep program even the biggest banks are coming back into the bank sweep program which tells you everyones looking to liquidity so our view was we could be more aggressive wed have chances on further increases to modify or not to be as aggressive if we could see a cooling down or going the other way but is to make sure that we first treated clients fairly but we did a good job of retaining cash balances i mean weve lived through cycles when cash was really tight in the industry and some people are already putting out high yield savings and other cds and deposits to fund now right so their sweep rates may be lower but theyre also adding higher cost deposits so were just trying to look longterm on it take care of clients and yet we know in a rising rates if they keep rising we think we always had time to adjust so paul i dont know if you want to comment on changing beta or not but its hard to tell until we have a rate setting committee itll certainly be what it was at least historically it may be a little higher paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc i think you covered it well paul steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks paul and paul appreciate you taking my questions paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thanks steve operator thank you the next question comes from kyle voigt kbw please go ahead kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning maybe first question is on pcg segment expenses total segment revenues were up compensable revenues i think were up but when you look at the pcg administrative comp expenses they were up yearonyear i know some of that may be related to inorganic growth i guess when you look year onyear you havent have the organic growth rate for those expenses and any more color as to kind of whats driving that level of growth both yearonyear or even the ph million sequential increase we saw in that line item thank you raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so that was actually a good catch because what we havent specifically drawn out in the numbers is that weve all been concerned about our associates and the impact of inflation in this environment and a number of firms have done kind of across the board comp adjustments or comp across the board salary adjustments and we decided to take a different course which we did this quarter is to give really just a offcycle bonus to our lower paying associates to help them cope with the inflationary costs of gasoline housing and everything else and not do an automatic salary adjustment really for two reasons as salaries are forever but more importantly as we wanted to do it thoughtfully across all of our associates in our yearend process which is actually a number of months is to make sure that people are rewarded accordingly and that the salaries are ph benched markto market instead of just doing a raise now that its hard to do an unraise for those who shouldnt have we gave kind of a onetime bonus and that really hit the segment but it really is taking care of our associates and doing an unbelievable job weve been great our turnover has certainly been up but its been lower than the industry theyve been doing a good job for us and we felt we owed them to do this which should take them to the yearend until we get to our normal cycle adjustments paul i dont know if you want to go through anymore in terms of numbers or anything else but that was the biggest impact of that number kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah i mean i guess could you quantify the impact of that bonus paul paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah in total for the firm is about just under million for the firm and pcg takes the majority of it just because theyre by far the largest business and have the most associates kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats helpful and then my followup is just on the advisor count you noted that there was a switch of advisors with most of them from one firm moving to your ria division can you just help us understand how large those switches were from an aum standpoint and then any more color on the switch can you kind of remind us of the change in economics when migrations like that happen thank you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well first strategically weve set up and really bolstered our ria offering just because it was and it has been the fastestgrowing segment in the industry and the good news is when people have switched to ria they havent gone to any of our custodian competitors almost virtually have stayed at raymond james so its been a good retention tool this was really one big firm whose business model has changed we knew it was coming weve been planning on it for a year the good news is again they stayed with raymond james their assets are custodied with us but in the ria model theyre not finra licensed and the way we count advisors are producing advisors who have a finra license but once they go into the ria space we cant count that anymore so if you look at it since really a year and a half its been about advisors there was a big group that moved at the end of the year relatively big but its usually three or four advisors a quarter and this was a oneoff raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 movement that really focused on kind of a changing business strategy for them so i think it was its not certainly business as usual its one of the largest firms on the platform that went to ria and we dont see people will continue to move but its not any different than the movement between the rest of our channels operator thank you the next question comes from jim mitchell seaport research please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners hey good morning paul maybe just on the tristate deal now that its closed i think since you announced the deal obviously rates are a lot higher youve had looks like better loan growth at tristate so is there any way to think can you at least give us maybe a sense of accretion benefits is it more than you expected and is the timing sooner is that the way to think about it or if theres any kind of greater specificity that would be helpful paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc i think youre right jim all of the sort of some of the major factors including interest rates which is a significant factor are increasing much faster than we originally anticipated which is a great tailwind but most importantly is that the tristate has been doing a fantastic job serving their clients through the announcement and through the closing and integration and they have been able to continue growing their business nicely with their clients and where frankly a lot of our efforts are staying out of their way because theyre doing such a great job with their client relationships and theyre handling a lot of change all at once dealing with their clients so thats been all more positive than we originally anticipated and a great kudos to the tristate capital team for being able to pull that off now with that being said our earnings base is going to be higher in a higher rate environment as well so the accretiondilution analysis is a function of both the numerator and the denominator being our earnings base so its hard to compare applestoapples and frankly paul and i arent really concerned about the shortterm accretion were looking at this we determine the success of a transaction over the next to years and what that really entails is keeping their franchise and their client relationships intact which is going extremely well its great to have that interest rate tailwinds and its great to see the growth that theyre having but again were not overly focused on what the nearterm accretion is going to be but were extremely excited by the success that theyve had thus far in the early innings paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc but i guess james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners this sounds like oh go ahead paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc it is better and were pleased indiscernible raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners youre right so it sounds like youre saying theres not a lot of theres no real negative surprises on the expense side or anything that the upside in revenues is falling to the bottom line paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah thats correct james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay and then on the buyback is that you said a few quarters is that the right pace that you think you can do say the next three or four quarters you can kind of offset the dilution or the issuance paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc i think were going to be james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners yeah go ahead im sorry paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc were going to be patient yeah were going to be patient that sounds like a reasonable timeline but depending on other capital needs balance sheet growth other factors we could do it faster or slower than that but were going to be as i said from the start and as paul said from the start were not going to be in a rush to buy it back it kind of gets us to the same place a year from now whether we do it quickly or we do it in a more deliberate manner james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners sure but i think okay paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc the plan is around your timeframe but again deploying capital if you had big bank growth that was very profitable you had an acquisition you had something else you could redeploy some of that capital but the plan right now is and theres no plans on any of that right now but i mean the plan would be to kind of stick to that course but well watch if the economy really turns down sharply then you may slow it down but i think everything being equal thats the plan james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners right it makes sense thank you raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah operator thank you the next question comes from devin ryan jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey good morning guys how are you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc great devin paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey most have been asked here but i do want to dig in a little bit more on advisor recruiting i heard the kind of the pipeline remains strong but theres been a lot of change in the environment and so id love to just get a little more context on some of the trends you guys are seeing there so one hand you have markets down sort of im assuming production down but your higher interest rates makes the businesses more profitable at the firm level so what are you guys i guess seeing and are expectations shifting at all on the advisor side and then competitively what are you seeing and then the fact that markets are choppy and sometimes its hard for advisors to leave when theyre inundated talking to clients and so im just curious kind of thematically how the advisor recruiting pipeline is evolving and what you guys are seeing competitively in the market paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah devin i think that first its always been competitive if you look at our kind of our record growth its probably not all and its not really just an advisor count but its the size of the businesses that have been joining our platform we have some very very large teams one just a few years ago we would never see and i really its kind of a testament to the platform that was built in the high net worth and ultrahigh net worth space and i think the when alex brown joined us they brought kind of a lot of knowledge and focus to us on building the platform for the entire firm so the recruiting is going very well it goes in cycles the independent channel was kind of on fire the employee channels been the one this year thats doing really really well and i think thats more of the sign of the economy is where people are joining and the risks theyre taking we have not seen a slowdown we thought we would see more people typically when advisors commit the pipeline theyll itll slip we thought wed see a lot more slippage and we havent really maybe a little more so advisors are still coming once they make that decision we rarely see them decide not to leave their firm so the pace is still very very good its competitive its always been competitive we always seem to have in certain spaces certain competitors really jump out in the market raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 but i think we pay a fair transition assistance and cant say its the highest in the market but we compete very well because of the value proposition so so far so good its been if we had any concerns about it it still looks very very solid right now devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great thanks paul the followup here i want to come back to something we talked about in late may at your analyst day and you guys spoke about kind of a focus on new noncompensable revenues and expanding those and i think your admin extension being one in indiscernible business consulting group and i know theres others interesting opportunity it feels like from the outside but want to just get some thoughts around i guess one how these are going in their early days and then two could these actually become material financial contributors a few years out i appreciate you have to scale them there has to be adoption but is the goal to have them become meaningful revenue drivers or is it more just around kind of the differentiation of the platform adding more service and creating kind of more stickiness to the advisor relationship because youre kind of more integrated with them thanks paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think its more almost the latter than the former i think that strengthening the platform by offering those services it makes the platform more attractive and people easier to transition the uptake on the services has been much better than we thought even existing advisors who have big businesses whether theyre having like everyone the war on talent or someone gets indiscernible has to be out of the office or were finding an uptick of those services and theyre very very happy with it so were in the early scaling days and i doubt its going to be a line item like brokerage revenue but its going to be something that certainly is going to positively impact the margins for those businesses and so its early were still scaling them but so far its very very good but were just a few quarters really into it so but the reception even of existing advisors is higher than we thought devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah i appreciate that i know its early but thanks for the color and ill leave it there thanks guys operator thank you and our final question comes from manan gosalia of morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i apologize if youve already covered this but my question is on thirdparty bank deposits and what were seeing from other banks this quarter is that deposit growth is slowing and even shrinking in certain cases and that would mean that the demand for your deposits from thirdparty banks is likely to increase even further from here can you talk about how youre thinking about that and also the billion or so you have in the cip program i recognize that you have a need for those deposits for your own business now but i was wondering how nimble you can be between cip thirdparty bank deposits and your own bank paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 great question manan we can be very flexible with the deposits to your point the cip balances on the balance sheet are really overflow balances for when we werent able to sweep the thirdparty banks because they didnt have the demand and so as that demand picks up which it has been picking up still early days but were definitely seeing a change in tone even from the big banks who historically have not been as eager to get those type of deposits were starting to see significant demand from those banks as well so as we start seeing that demand pick up we would be able to sweep more from cip to those thirdparty banks all else being equal so but we do have a lot of flexibility its great to see the demand come back we knew the demand would eventually come back and so thats why we wanted to stay flexible with those deposits manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc but can you also be flexible between thirdparty bank deposits and your own bank depending on what level of loan growth youre seeing at your own bank paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah absolutely i mean the billion thats with thirdparty banks now and the billion thats with client interest programs and that has declined somewhat since the beginning of july as i said in the comments but those deposits over time can a good portion of a very large portion of those deposits over time could be used to fund the balance sheet growth to the extent that we find good riskadjusted returns on the balance sheet and to the extent that we can grow loans to our private client group clients et cetera so again we have a lot of flexibility and a lot of capacity manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great and then my second question is just how youre thinking about sbl loan growth you have your won offering and now also tristate which youre managing as a separate business but it still gives you exposure to a similar loan product and as we see this pressure and volatility across both equity and fixed income markets how should we think about loan growth in that segment given that rates are moving higher and that loan book has a low credit risk is there plan to meet all the demand you have for that portfolio and maybe slow some of the growth in ci and cre as recession risks rise or i mean i just wanted to get a sense of like how youre prioritizing loan growth in this environment and what youre seeing in terms of demand paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well first its a good question but the if you look at whats going to happen in rising rates i think that its still a cheaper source of borrowing for most clients so we anticipate that rates get higher and higher and higher and maybe people dont borrow but in this environment its still a very effective way of and low cost way to borrow from our standpoint we love two things about sbls one is the liquidity because its callable secondly its very secured and its low risk and it has frankly the best spreads right now so but also it supports clients so we continue to focus on that segment we can speed up and any part of the loan segment weve done it before i think were one of the few banks that sold a lot of covid loans to reduce risk on the balance sheet and there are times we have taken different parts of the portfolio and slowed it down for a while most of the portfolio even ci has a very liquid portion and the term b loans and so we do manage the balance sheet so were very happy that sbl loans are in demand and raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 growing and we plan to support that and well look at the relative contribution of each item depending on where we see the risk return tradeoffs longterm and the market if we are offering if the market starts offering risky credit only then you slowdown that segment so yeah the tristate market is very different from ours our markets internal their markets external to other firms and so those are very separate are run separately but we like the sbl loans in both categories and both banks and have the capital and the cash to fund them too which is important we have a lot of flexibility in funding manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks for taking my questions operator and that was our final question ill turn the call back over to our speakers for any closing remarks paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yes i want to thank everybody for attending and i know the numbers are a little bit more difficult with a lot of the acquisitionrelated expenses and changes so i appreciate the effort i know by the questions and the writeups youve put a lot of time into it so i want to thank you and again as always thank our advisors and associates for all theyve done to generate these numbers so its easy to present them when theyre doing such a great job so thank you and well talk to you next call operator thank you this does conclude the conference for today we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines thank you and have a good day
