the call over to chair and ceo paul reilly paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good morning and thank you for joining us today before i discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year earnings i want to start by acknowledging the heartbreaking devastation our friends and neighbors as well as over associates on floridas central gulf coast experienced a month ago from hurricane ian while it has been difficult to bear witness to their pain and loss i also have been humbled by the resilience of our associates advisors and the community there fortunately our raymond james family impacted by the storm is safe just as notable i cant adequately express my gratitude for our tampa bay area associates who despite facing an uncertain path from a category hurricane worked diligently from remote locations to continue delivering our service first promise additionally our associates at our corporate locations in memphis in southfield and denver rose to the occasion covering for their coworkers and pitching in where they could and working weekends to catch up for those without power or other hardships the home office was open to provide a comfortable and clean place to go when the home office reopened the camaraderie was obvious and uplifting we provided emotional and mental health resources to associates delivered a relief check to all associates in impacted counties and provided additional timeoff to help them manage their personal situations associates collected two semitrucks of supplies which were sent to our fort myers branch system to be distributed by advisors and associates in their areas weve heard several heartwarming stories from recipients of these essential supplies which in itself shows how the collective efforts and generosity truly made a difference for those who needed it most the firm also responded by raising more than million from corporate executive leadership and associate donations to assist the recovery and support of those in need through the red cross and our friends at raymond james charity who directly help associates with needed emergency funds for repairs and recovery if i sound surprised im not the preparation perseverance and response to the storm reflected the long history of raymond james service culture and im especially proud to represent our team today now moving to our results im very pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year especially given the challenging market conditions despite the significant decline in equity markets during the year we still generated record net revenues and record pretax income for the fourth quarter and fiscal year throughout the fiscal year we remain focused on the long term and continued to invest in our businesses our people and our technology to help drive growth across our businesses in the private client group strong retention and recruiting raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 of financial advisors contributed to industryleading growth with domestic net new assets of over the fiscal year furthermore the charles stanley acquisition completed earlier in the year significantly expanded our presence in the uk which is a very attractive market for wealth management in capital markets annual investment banking results were very strong only lower than the record results achieved in fiscal record ma revenues help offset the very challenging underwriting environment we continue to see strong pipelines through ma as the expertise weve added both organically and through niche acquisitions has been performing extremely well we completed the acquisition of sumridge partners on july which has enhanced our fixed income platform with technologydriven capabilities and a fantastic team with extensive experience dealing with corporates this business thrives on rate volatility so sumridge generated really fantastic results since we closed on the acquisition in july however after a record year last year our legacy fixed income operations serving depositories has been challenged as the fed intensifies its monetary tightening initiatives in the bank segment loans grew yearoveryear and during the quarter reflecting attractive growth across nearly all loan categories the acquisition of tristate capital bank this year added a bestinclass third party securitiesbased lending capability while also diversifying our funding sources it is in uncertain conditions such as these that reminds us the importance of focusing on and making decisions for the long term as evidenced this quarter with the sharp increase in net interest income and rjbdp fees we are well positioned for the continued rise in shortterm interest rates with diverse and ample funding sources strong loan growth high concentration of floating rate assets and ample balance sheet flexibility given solid capital ratios which are well in excess of regulatory requirements while some of these attributes may be underappreciated in certain market cycles the value of our longterm approach has really resonated in more volatile and uncertain market environment weve experienced since the onset of the covid19 pandemic in the fiscal fourth quarter the firm reported record net revenues of billion record pretax income of million and net income available to common shareholders of million or earnings per diluted share of net income was negatively impacted by the elevated tax rates this quarter due primarily to nondeductible losses on corporateowned life insurance that we utilized to fund nonqualified benefit plans excluding million of expenses related to acquisitions quarterly adjusted net income available to common shareholders was million or per diluted share yearoveryear and sequential revenue growth was driven primarily by the benefit of higher shortterm interest rates on both rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks and net interest income which more than offset the declines in asset management and related administrative fees and total brokerage revenue largely due to decline in equity markets quarterly net income available to common shareholders increased compared to the prior years fiscal fourth quarter reflecting the aforementioned revenue growth which was partially offset by higher noncompensation expenses and higher tax rate sequentially quarterly net income grew driven primarily by the benefit from higher shortterm interest rates to the net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks along with lower bank loan provision for credit losses as the prior quarter included the million initial provision for credit losses on loans arising from the acquisition of tristate capital holdings annualized return on common equity for the quarter was and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was an impressive result especially given the challenging market environment and our strong capital position raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 moving to slide we ended the quarter with total client assets under administration of trillion pcg assets in feebased accounts of billion and financial assets under management of billion equity market declines in the quarter including a sequential decline in the sp index negatively impacted client asset levels we ended the quarter with financial advisors in pcg a net increase of over the prior year period and over the preceding quarter and remember the yearoveryear increase the advisor count was impacted by transition of advisors to our ria custody service sic ria custody services division where we typically retain the assets but we dont include the advisor in our accounts in the fiscal year we had financial advisors moved to rcs of which came from one firm adjusting for these transfers the numbers of financial advisors increased year overyear a really strong result our focus on supporting advisors and their clients especially during uncertain and volatile markets led us to strong results in terms of advisor retention as well as our recruiting of experienced advisors to the raymond james platforms through our multiple affiliation options over the trailing 12month period ending september we recruited to our domestic independent contractor and employee channels financial advisors with nearly million of trailing production and approximately billion of client assets at their previous firms and highlighting our industryleading growth we generated domestic pcg net new assets of nearly billion over the fiscal year ending september representing of domestic client assets at the beginning of the period fourth quarter domestic pcg net new assets growth was annualized total client domestic cash sweep balances declined to billion or of domestic pcg assets under administration paul shoukry will discuss this more later but id like to highlight that these are lowercost deposits as we have not yet utilized highyield savings accounts to preserve balances total bank loans grew sequentially to a record billion reflecting attractive broadbased growth at both raymond james bank and tristate capital bank moving to slide the private client group generated record results with quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million while assetbased revenues declined the segments results were lifted by the benefit from both higher shortterm interest rates the capital markets segment generate quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million capital market sic capital markets revenues declined compared to the prior year period mostly driven by lower investment banking revenues and fixed income brokerage revenues largely due to the volatile and uncertain markets the asset management segment generated net revenues of million and pretax income of million the declines in revenues and pretax income were largely attributable to lower financial assets under management as net inflows into feebased accounts in the private client group were offset by fixed income and equity market declines the bank segment which includes raymond james bank and tristate capital bank generated quarterly net revenue of million which is a record result and pretax income of million net revenue growth was mainly due to higher loan balances and significant expansion of the banks net interest margin to for the quarter up basis points in the preceding quarter once again reflecting the flexibility and floating rate nature of our balance sheet this quarter also included a full quarter of tristate capital results which have continued to be solid raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 looking at the full year fiscal results on slide we generated record net revenues of billion and record pretax income of billion both up over fiscal record earnings per diluted share of increased compared to fiscal additionally we generated strong annualized return on common equity of and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of moving to the fiscal year segment results on slide private client group asset management and bank segments generated record net revenues and the private client group produced record pretax income during the fiscal year again reinforcing the value of our diverse and complementary businesses and now for more detailed review of the fiscal fourth quarter results im going to turn the call over to paul shoukry paul paul shoukry chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thank you paul starting with consolidated revenues on slide record quarterly net revenues of billion grew yearoveryear and sequentially asset management fees declined compared to the prior years fiscal fourth quarter and compared to the preceding quarter in line with the guidance we provided on last quarters call based on feebased assets equity markets declined further during the quarter resulting in a sequential decline in private client group assets in feebased accounts this decline will create a headwind for asset management and related administrative fees in the fiscal first quarter which i expect to be down close to sequentially in the fiscal first quarter of brokerage revenues of million declined compared to the prior years fiscal fourth quarter and compared to the preceding quarter as lower activity and assetbased trail revenues in pcg as well as decreased fixed income brokerage revenues more than offset the addition of sumridge which generated strong revenues in the quarter as paul touched on we expect this to be a tough environment for our legacy fixed income business as depository clients have quickly transitioned from having excess deposits to invest in securities to experiencing deposit runoff as a result of the feds actions ill discuss account and service fees and net interest income shortly investment banking revenues of million declined compared to the preceding quarter a solid result given the challenging and uncertain market environment and while our pipelines are strong there remains a lot of uncertainty given the heightened market volatility that could impact investment banking revenues positively or negatively in the coming quarters therefore our best guess right now is that we could achieve a similar level of average quarterly investment banking revenues in fiscal that we experienced over the last two quarters obviously a lot of variables can and probably will impact that estimate but that would result in a decline in investment banking revenues in fiscal that would still represent a much higher level of investment banking revenues than we generated prior to the pandemic as we have made significant investments to the platform over the past few years which has significantly increased our productive capacity and market share other revenues of million grew sequentially primarily due to higher affordable housing investment business revenues which achieved record results in fiscal raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep balances ended the quarter at billion down compared to the preceding quarter and representing of domestic pcg client assets as of this week these balances have declined to just under billion reflecting the quarterly fee payments which were paid in october as well as additional cash sorting activity during the month when comparing trends across the industry it is important to note that these cash sweep balances do not include highyield savings balances nor do we have a money market sweeps option so it is sometimes difficult to make applestoapples comparisons across the industry most of the decline in our sweep balances were experienced in the client interest program at the brokerdealer which was really the lastin firstout destination of the excess deposits over the past couple of years as we have been explaining for at least a year now we anticipated a significant decline in these cash balances as the fed started increasing shortterm interest rates so we kept the cip balances invested in deposit accounts and shortterm treasuries the raymond james bank deposit sweep program continues to be a relatively lowcost source of stable funding and now with the addition of tristate capital banks independent deposit franchise we have a more diversified funding base and while this additional funding source may not have seen this valuable several months ago i think everyone now appreciates just how precious deposits are and the importance of having multiple funding sources turning to slide combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks was million up over the prior years fiscal fourth quarter and from the preceding quarter this strong growth reflects the immediate impact from higher shortterm rates given the limited duration and high concentration of floating rate assets on our balance sheet while it can sometimes seem appropriate to take more duration and bet on rates our longstanding approach to maintain a high concentration of floating rate assets is proving to be a significant tailwind in this rising rate environment you can see on the bottom portion of the slide the bank segments net interest margin increased a substantial basis points sequentially to for the quarter and thats on top of the 40basispoint sequential increase in nim in the preceding quarter the average yield on rjbdp balances with thirdparty banks increased nearly basis points to both the nim and average yield from thirdparty banks are expected to increase further with the anticipated rate increases for the fiscal first quarter factoring in an expected 75basispoint rate increase in november and some assumptions around deposit beta and other variables we would expect the average yield on rjbdp from third party banks for the fiscal first quarter of to be somewhere around and the bank segments nim to average around but these projections will obviously be impacted by the actual deposit beta we experience as we have done this cycle we will continue to put clients first and focus on staying on the more generous end of the spectrum for our clients so far the cumulative deposit beta since the fed started increasing rates in march has been around with the most recent increase in september having a deposit beta of about less than the we expected but still much more generous to clients than the vast majority of our competitors moving to consolidated expenses on slide beginning with our largest expense compensation the total compensation ratio for the quarter was which decreased from in the preceding quarter the adjusted compensation ratio was during the quarter the sequential decline in the compensation ratio largely reflects a significant benefit from higher net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 noncompensation expenses of million which includes ph million of acquisitionrelated expenses included in our nongaap earnings adjustments decreased sequentially this quarter reflected a full quarter of expenses for both tristate capital and sumridge partners which sequentially added just over million of incremental noncompensation expenses excluding the bank loan loss provision for credit losses the bank loan loss provision for credit losses decreased to million primarily due to the million initial provision associated with the tristate capital acquisition in the fiscal third quarter this quarters bank loan provision primarily reflects sequential loan growth along with a weaker macroeconomic outlook used in the cecl models so as you can see we remain focused on the disciplined management of all compensation and non compensationrelated expenses while still investing heavily in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters in the fiscal fourth quarter we generated a pretax margin of and an adjusted pretax margin of really excellent results and just to get ahead of it i know many of you will ask me if we will update our to pretax margin target that we laid out at our analyst and investor day in may since we exceeded it this quarter while that is certainly a reasonable ask given the market uncertainty and ongoing cash sorting dynamic we think its appropriate to wait at least a few more months to update all of our targets but with that being said i think our solid results this quarter highlight the benefit of our diversified business model the upside we preserve to higher shortterm interest rates and our consistent focus on being disciplined on expenses on slide at quarterend total assets were billion a sequential decrease primarily reflecting the decline in the client interest program cash balances i mentioned earlier liquidity and capital remained very strong rjf corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at billion well above our billion target the tier leverage ratio of and total capital ratio of are both more than double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized indiscernible tier leverage ratio at the end of the quarter is actually closer to so our capital levels continue to provide significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and invest in growth the effective tax rate for the quarter increased to up from in the preceding quarter primarily due to nondeductible losses on the corporateowned life insurance portfolio going forward we still believe around to is an appropriate estimate to use in your models but in rapidly declining equity markets the effective tax rate increases as we experience this quarter and last quarter and vice versa when equity markets increase slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters since the closing of the tristate acquisition on june through october we have repurchased approximately million common shares for million or approximately per share under our board authorization as of october approximately million remained available under the boardapproved share repurchase authorization which we typically revisit annually in the upcoming board meeting we remain committed to offset the share issuance associated with the acquisition of tristate as well as a share based compensation dilution therefore we expect to repurchase on average million per quarter in fiscal or billion total for the fiscal year of course we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and other capital and cash needs as we plan for these repurchases over the coming quarters but i do want to emphasize this billion objective for fiscal lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for our bank segment which now includes raymond james bank and tristate capital bank the credit quality of the loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 continuing to improve criticized loans as a percent of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at just the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment ended the quarter at down from at september of and nearly flat sequentially the yearoveryear decline in the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans held for investment largely reflects the higher proportion of securitybased loans boosted by the acquisition of tristate capital bank securitiesbased loans which account for approximately of net loans are generally collateralized by marketable securities and therefore typically do not require an allowance for credit losses if you look at the bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans held for investment as a percentage of the total corporate loans it was at quarterend compared to most other banks we believe this represents a healthy reserve but we are continuing to closely monitor any impacts of inflation supply chain constraints and a potential recession on our corporate loan portfolio now ill turn the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul as i stated at the start of our call i am pleased with our results and while there are many uncertainties i believe we are well positioned to drive growth across all of our businesses in the private client group next quarter results will be negatively impacted by the expected sequential decline of asset management fees and related administrative fees that paul described earlier focusing more on the long term im optimistic well continue delivering industryleading growth as current and prospective advisors are attracted to our clientfocused values and leading technology and production solutions additionally the segment will also continue to benefit from higher shortterm interest rates although we expect cash sorting will continue as the fed increases shortterm interest rates in the capital markets segment the ma pipeline remains strong but the pace and timing of closings will be heavily influenced by market conditions over the long term i am confident we are well positioned for growth given the significant investments weve made over the past five years in the fixed income space the favorable environment weve experienced over the past couple of years has shifted depository clients once flush with cash and facing limited opportunity for loan growth are now experiencing declines in deposits and have less cash available for investing in securities this dynamic will lead to a challenging environment for fiscal while this headwind exists we expect sumridge partners to enhance our current position in the rapidly evolving fixed income and trading technology marketplace and sumridge typically benefits from elevated rate volatility in the asset management segment the financial assets under management are starting the fiscal year lower due to the decline in equity and fixed income markets however we are confident that strong growth of assets in fee based accounts in the private client group segment will drive longterm growth of financial assets under management in addition we expect raymond james investment management formerly carillon tower associates sic carillon tower advisers to help drive further growth through increased scale distribution operational and marketing synergies the bank segment is well positioned for rising shortterm interest rates and we have ample funding and capital to grow the balance sheet prudently we will continue to operate tristate capital bank as a separately chartered raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 bank and respect its relationships with its clients which coupled with our strong capital and funding should foster its ongoing growth most importantly the credit quality of the banks loan portfolio remains strong as always i want to thank all of our advisors and associates for their perseverance and dedication to providing excellent service to their clients each and every day just as youve observed over the past two years which have been filled with tremendous uncertainty and challenges we will stay rooted in our commitment to take care of advisors and clients making decisions for the longterm and maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet we believe with this approach we should be able to continue delivering strong results through different market environments and drive results for our associates advisors and shareholders just as we have for the past years with that operator will you please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you very much operator instructions ill proceed with our first question on the line from manan gosalia with morgan stanley go right ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey manan paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hi manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i was wondering good morning hey i was wondering can you talk about what your assumptions are for deposit betas in your nim guidance for next quarter because it looks like even with the 75basispoint increase in the fed funds rate in november and a significantly higher average fed funds rate next quarter versus the prior quarter i think you guided your nim rising only basis points or so so i guess the question is what are you baking in for deposit betas and is there some element of conservatism embedded in there paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc as you know manan we do like to provide conservative guidance and that admittedly is somewhat conservative its only factoring in the november increase and the markets obviously expecting a december increase as well and so sofr tends to lead those type of increases as we saw last quarter so we had basispoint sequential increase two quarters ago in the nim basis points this quarter and were guiding basis points but it certainly could be higher than that going forward raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 we were expecting deposit beta as rates kind of continue to increase to get closer to on the last incremental increase for us it was and cumulatively it was and weve been really leading most of the industry focusing on clients and sharing and being generous with clients as the rates have increased and so going forward frankly might be too conservative as well just because of when you look at competitors were certainly well ahead of most of our competitors on the sweep rates manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it then on thirdparty bank deposits we saw through this earnings season that many banks relying more on wholesale funding so i guess the question is what are you seeing in terms of demand from thirdparty banks and where should we expect the thirdparty bank fee rate to go if the fed stabilizes at and is there a possibility that youre able to earn a higher spread on those deposits as you renegotiate your contracts next year than the typical i think fed funds plus basis points or so that youre typically on paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think absolutely the demands way up and i as you pointed out if you look at almost all of our competitors if you really look at just whats happened to cash sweeps were all in the same ballpark its just most of the other firms have gone into highyield savings to supplement their cash or the money market sweeps so we havent done that so we may but today we feel like we have ample lowcost funding with our sweeps and we do see the demand going up which will impact rates and paul ill let you address the rate dynamic paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean at the trough in the last year or so the demand from thirdparty banks was obviously very weak and the pricing was kind of in that fed funds effective range which was down basis points or so from the peak spreads a couple of years prior so were quickly seeing that demand resume thats the first step and now were starting to see prices and the economics improve on the spread but again 20basispoint spread improvement if thats sort of the potential to get back to the last kind of peak spread two years ago pales in comparison to the base rate improvement that we get from the federal reserve on those balances so netnet a significant tailwind though on those balances manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so it sounds like in terms of the fee rate you could be well above the percentage points or so that you peaked at during the prior cycle at the so if we compare the end of this rate hike cycle should we expect a fee rate above the percentage points that you saw last cycle paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean were ph already guiding just for this upcoming quarter to indiscernible raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc yes correct paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yes manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right perfect thank you operator thank you very much well proceed with our next question on the line from jerry ohara with jefferies go right ahead gerald edward ohara q analyst jefferies llc great thanks perhaps just a little bit of context or color on the advisor recruiting market i know its obviously been another kind of challenging quarter from a volatility standpoint so would just love to get a little bit of color as to what youre seeing industry wide in terms of those dynamics paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yes yeah i think ive been now what dozen years on this job and everybody always ask me if the recruiting market seems to be getting more competitive and so my response is its kind of always been competitive and weve been on a good roll so we still see it as very active we even in we thought recruiting in our best year would go off because of the great dislocation but it was actually resulted in our best couple of years until the recent few years so its still very active its very competitive and continues to be such but as you can see with our kind of advisors added this year if you adjust for the ria channel the people that moved ph to our advisor account weve had another very very strong year and really the largest teams weve ever recruited continue to come in and so the average is going up also not just market but just the attraction of our platform for highnetworth and ultrahighnetworth advisors as well as the advisors that weve recruited throughout our history so were still still a big part of our strategy we think itll still be strong backlog is strong and it probably wont last forever but it looks pretty good in the short to midterm gerald edward ohara q analyst jefferies llc fair enough and then perhaps one for paul shoukry can you maybe just comment a little bit we obviously saw an increase from to on the noncomp side of expenses that actually came off a little bit in but can you perhaps maybe help us think a little bit about how that kind of run rate might look going into the next couple of quarters raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc jerry most of the sequential increase was really attributable to having a full quarter results for both tristate capital and sumridge which sequentially added about million of noncompensation expenses so that was the primary driver of the sequential increase which we expected looking forward i think if you look at this quarter as a baseline and i think theres around million of noncompensation expenses when you adjust out for the loan loss provision and for some of the acquisitionrelated expenses that we break out in our nongaap schedule and looking forward i would say that would be potentially our best guess right now for fiscal is that number totaling around billion in fiscal which off the million base represents somewhere around growth sequentially each quarter in and most of that growth will really be coming from our technology investments were still heavily investing in technology to support advisors their clients and really all of the businesses and functions across the firm so thats going to continue to be a significant focus for us going forward and then youre going to see kind of on a yearoveryear basis growth in business development expenses as the first half of fiscal travel and conferences obviously were still suppressed by the covid pandemic so youll see that normalized for the full year in fiscal gerald edward ohara q analyst jefferies llc okay great thanks for taking my questions this morning operator thank you very much well go to our next question on the line from alex blostein with goldman sachs go right ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey guys good morning thanks for the question so maybe first just focusing on some of the bank dynamics i guess if we look at the last cycle bank nim peaked at around and not to pinpoint you to any specific quarter but i guess when you zoom out a little bit and taking your conservative posture on the deposit betas but it doesnt sound like theyre going up above if you think about tristate now in the mix thats more loan heavy so obviously higher yielding and the absolute level of rates is higher so should we be thinking closer to bank nim once the fed is done or how are you thinking about that sort of run rate on the other end of that cycle paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc alex theres a lot of moving parts i would say one of the differences now versus in the last cycle is that our concentration of securitiesbased loans are higher now that has a typically has a lower nim associated with it because theyre fully collateralized with liquid marketable securities so the riskadjusted returns are very attractive but typically lower nim through cycles relative to corporate loans and so theres a lot of moving parts there i think just like i shared with manan on the bdp fees i think this time around i mean rates are expected to be higher than they were last cycle just the base rates and so given the loan mix higher rates a lot of different variables but i dont think we can call necessarily a ceiling but i dont think were also ready to say that it could achieve either i think we need to kind of see where cash sorting and cost of deposit trends play out raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it all right fair enough just staying on the balance sheet theme for one more minute you guys obviously had the right call on not extending duration a year or two ago and keeping the balance sheet fairly floating but if you look at whats going on today security yields are quite attractive and maybe theres a little bit more upside but thats a fairly good return on invested capital as you kind of look at what the market rates are today what are your thoughts about building a securities portfolio from here maybe extending duration a little bit just to lock in what looks like pretty attractive rates of return paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so were not against the securities portfolio but our first thing is to fund our growth and loans and securities becomes the next part of it so we agree theyre attractive after being beat up for not locking in rates over a number of years were not after indiscernible out and now having the balance sheet were not ready to call that weve reached peak rates and were going to start locking in so i think at least in the near term were going to be flexible as the fed probably has a couple of rate hikes and then well look at it and if things settle down we may balance in a little more but our first funding is for growth and then any excess funding were certainly happy to put in securities because youre right they have a very good spread right now paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i think i think kind of looking forward we really built up the securities portfolio in the last couple of years as the theres very little thirdparty bank demand so we kind of brought it on to the balance sheet as an accommodation but now with the cash sorting dynamics with loan growth being solid we would expect some of that buildup in securities to really run off over the next year to fund that loan growth that paul talked about and some of that loan growth has duration as well i mean so you saw the mortgage portfolio grew sequentially during the quarter pretty nicely there is duration obviously associated with that portfolio that gives us that same type of protection but to the extent that we take duration our preference has been to take it to support client relationships and to the extent that we have excess kind of cash beyond the loan growth then we would certainly invest in securities because it is a good return as is the cash we sweep off to thirdparty banks as well so right now we have a lot of different options and thats just the power of the flexibility that we have with the cash balances and the flexibility that we preserved frankly through the last couple of years alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it all right thanks i wont ask the pretax margin question just to remind that there was a plus at the guidance next to when you guys gave it last time i just wanted to make sure that its still there paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yes it was over paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc told you so raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks operator thank you very much well proceed with our next question on the line from steven chubak of wolfe research go right ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey steve paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start with a question on indiscernible you alluded paul to some of the headwinds to the business its been run rating in the last couple of quarters at about million this most recent quarter you noted included sumridge partners contribution as well as the fed continues to remove excess liquidity from the system do you anticipate further pressure on this million baseline or is that a fair run rate that we can underwrite looking out to next year paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc you can see the dynamic we have a great fixed income franchise but really in that banking space thats very very strong and theyre focused on the same dynamics the whole industry is so as cash tightens theyre going to fund loans first and securities second just like us so yeah that could have pressure now theres other parts of the business thatll certainly have pressure on that run rate if it gets tighter and again on the other hand sumridge is maybe timing is everything but this is kind of the perfect market for them to perform they are just really killing it right now but theyre everythings in their favor but everythings a headwind for that banking part of the franchise that were so good at so it could come under more pressure also steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great and just for my followup maybe on the comp ratio certainly a nice positive surprise especially relative to the guidance i understand paul or can appreciate your reluctance to update the to 20plus margin target but wanted to get a sense as to how we should think about your philosophy around comp given so much of the revenue growth is going to come from less compensable areas whats a reasonable expectation for where the comp rate should be running if rates stay higher for longer raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well where we have been even with our advisors and associates weve paid them what we think is fairly on their production and we havent paid on interest now interest went away we didnt change their payouts and comp obviously it affects managements comp so our plan right now is to keep interest rates will continue to be non compensable and so certainly impacts some of the bank comp but generally to the extent theres more interest spread and margin comp will go down to the extent that normalizes or goes the other way the ratio will go up theres no change fundamentally in how were paying based on it so again interest spreads will drive it down for a period of time i think spreads right now are like in any cycle probably outsized for i dont know if theyre out how long and it stays a year two years quarter but it will return but were our comp philosophy is the same so you should see improvement in spreads if interest spreads improve paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc i think the one thing i would add is the compensation philosophy kind of from outside of the sort of advisor force that paul was talking about was to help to share the success of the firm with our associates and we are in a high inflation environment and so whereas were entering yearend we are leaning in to being generous to our associates and sharing in the success with our associates just as we always do and so those yearend increases wont really be reflected until the second fiscal quarter the first calendar quarter of the fiscal year and thats when payroll taxes reset of course but as paul said the interest spreads have been a significant benefit to our compensation ratio down to this kind of range steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc okay and anything on the admin cost side that we need to be mindful of i do think the admin comp was running a little bit higher than we had anticipated or at least based on what some of the napkin math would suggest when you try to back out some of the noncompensable portions of revenue paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc i mean that reflects the full quarter of results from both tristate capital and sumridge so i think this baseline going forward is a good baseline to start off with but again we will increase salaries across the board and were leaning in to being generous with that given the competitive labor environment the inflationary pressures and the success that were having as a firm so we really want to share that success with the associates whove made it all possible and that again and were also continuing to hire in all of our businesses to support and continue the great growth that weve had across our businesses and so that that would really be reflected throughout fiscal steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc helpful color thanks for taking my questions operator thank you very much well proceed with our next question on the line from jim mitchell of seaport global go right ahead raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc jim are you there operator mr mitchell your line is open for your question jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hello can you hear me paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc i can hear you now paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc indiscernible jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay sorry so deposits are down to about of client assets based on sort of the guidance for october client cash i should say can you remind us of the historical average for cash levels maybe a low and high range just trying to think through where that starts to bottom out paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc its a pretty wide range i think the peak of that range was in the midteens in but of course that was because cash increase and markets decreased substantially but i would say the trough was somewhere in that range maybe a little lower than in so to your point were at i think the 25year historical average is probably in the to range so its a pretty wide range jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities right and is there a point where you have to more aggressively defend cash balances and deposits to fund the balance sheet and paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah absolutely i mean if they get ph low right now weve been fortunate and have managed it well as you know weve been focused on the flexible balance sheet but you need cash to operate the business so if you see runs weve talked about even offering highrate savings and others we just havent implemented it havent felt like we need to but if we see cash getting to levels that concern us we will do that we also have tristate now who is a very good source of funding theyve got a very strong net funding operation which was one of the reasons for the acquisition which i dont think few understood they said so much cash raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 why would you have it i think it was a year ago we were talking about our concern about cash in the future so its so weve got alternatives now but absolutely you need cash to run this business and you want to be able to service your client cash and at some point we look at our cash balances they havent left the system theyve gone more into fixed income or money markets in our platform so theyre still in the system we just havent kept them ph into the pure cash flow jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities great thanks operator thank you very much well go to our next question on the line from devin ryan with jmp securities go right ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey good morning guys how are you paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc good devin paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc good devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc good most questions have been asked want to come back to the balance sheet a bit here and just think about your mix and maybe followup on alexs question just your deposits obviously becoming more scarce here and so when you think about the mix moving forward are there beyond you may be thinking about securities book are there other areas maybe in the loan book or just more broadly where theres room for optimization and maybe areas to drive the riskadjusted nim higher from here all else equal paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc there probably always is indiscernible paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so part of what were doing as were going through our budgeting exercise is to say where do we want to deploy capital weve got with the banking business a broader bank business tristate is an independent business with its thirdparty platforms and the question is between that and raymond james bank where do you allocate capital in the portfolio really to optimize partly the balance sheet from our standpoint but really to allow freedom for example for tristate to service their customers so were going through that to make sure that the capital raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 allocations make sense both for those businesses and for us so there always is in the periods of rapid transition right now its a little bit harder to do it but were in a lot of discussion on it paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i would say just to reinforce that we really dont manage the balance sheet allocation to necessarily maximize nim we do it to maximize riskadjusted returns and we believe that securitiesbased loans both at raymond james bank to our own clients at tristate capital to their independent clients is the best riskadjusted return so that is kind of the priority to the extent that demand is there which we think that over time that should continue to be a good tailwind for us and then we look at the other loan categories we like the mix that we have right now with of our loans and securitiesbased loans so thats kind of how were thinking about it devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yes okay thanks paul and then a followup here just want to talk a little bit about the investment banking outlook appreciate theres always a little bit of crystal ball in there and you guys are going to i think err on the side of conservatism just given the uncertainty in the market but just want to make sure i understand how youre thinking about it you have equity issuances is going to be market centric but market stabilized that probably would improve and then your ma business is structurally larger so all else equal that the business trajectory over time is higher than fixed income it feels like maybe could remain a bit under pressure if rates remain higher so just trying to think about how much of maybe that this more muted nearterm outlook is just purely market centric versus maybe that the flip side would be maybe every business doesnt snap back to where it was over the last year or two because rates are higher or theres some other structural dynamic in the markets has changed so i just want to kind of parse through both the cyclical versus anything that may be a little bit more impaired for a continued period paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think if you look at ill go in reverse order the fixed income business i mean the challenge for a traditional fixed income business in a rising rate market is when do people invest kind of in the long term and that will happen as rates come up i think that that business will do well so people have been buying shorter term as they start buying longer term its more profitable for us too but you got to get rates to a point where people think rates are there to really start doing that and certainly the increase in rates will help but were just at a pause really till that happens so i think thats more timing mas are a little harder backlog is good clients are good even now right now its up for us and its up in europe for the industry and if you look at european dynamics with rates and inflation everything you go well how could that be so i mean theres still cash theres still strategic investors and our growth and our platform and who weve added and were continuing to grow it we believe in it but that ones harder to predict i mean its been stronger i think than most people have predicted with the backlog still strong but when people close or not or when that stops its just thats a tough one so when you come off of the last two years with almost unprecedented ma is that a baseline or is that a peak forever which it probably isnt but again were still very very high on that business but that ones kind of hard to say what triggers it to continue or what triggers it to slow down or stop for a while devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 okay all right thanks very much operator thank you well proceed to our next question on the line with kyle voigt from kbw go right ahead kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning so just given the level of sorting right now and the pressure that may put on total available funding as you look out a couple of years just completely understand the cautiousness and the tone around the size of the afs book and maybe letting some of that run off in order to support loan growth so just two followups on that what is the current duration of afs portfolio and how much of that portfolio would run off per year if you didnt reinvest at all in the portfolio and can you also remind us are there specific minimums that you need to hold in terms of the cip and a thirdparty bank sweep just so we have that as the sorting process continues here paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc i would say in the securities portfolio the average duration is somewhere around four years now in the securities portfolio so if you think about kind of a normal distribution you might have somewhere around to runoff a year probably back end loaded a little bit but and again were going to use a lot of that to fund the loan growth as the current plans there is a baseline for cip of cash balances there if you kind of look back in i think theres probably billion or billion of cash there for a variety of reasons and so maybe thats kind of a good way to think about the floor there for those balances and really with bdp thats a function of providing clients fdic insurance trying to maximize their fdic coverage as much as we possibly can given all the constraints and the demand from thirdparty banks kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and so is there is there i guess given your clients allocation and then you only have certain number of charters that you can provide fdic insurance with yourself so is there a certain amount of minimum there i guess on the thirdparty bank side is it a few billion dollars that needs to be held there or is it some number thats smaller than that paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc no really the way we think about the minimum on the bdp balances is essentially providing some level of funding buffer we dont want to overextend the funding as weve seen in the industry its challenging when you overextend the funding to your own banks and you dont have a buffer there and thats one of the things that were thinking through is what do we want that buffer to be now our balance sheet is much more liquid than it used to be years ago when we established the buffer that some of you are aware of so we think thats much too conservative but were kind of currently now that weve completed the acquisition of tristate capital understanding their balance sheet were currently in the midst of determining what the appropriate buffer is but were going to just as we always do err on the side of conservatism there as well kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 understood thats really helpful and i just had one followup related to administrative comp i think on last quarters call you mentioned there was an offcycle bonus paid in the fiscal third quarter which caused the pcg segment admin comp to be elevated but we saw another ph million sequential increase in that pcg admin comp line in the fiscal fourth quarter so just wondering what drove that and how much of that is onetime in nature if at all paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah im not sure i think it was a sequential increase and again that bounces around based on benefit accruals that we adjust for particularly at the end of the fiscal year making sure were fully funded and accrued for on benefits and other things so theres nothing that i could point to specifically that would describe that other than just sort of natural growth and like changes to the accruals et cetera kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay understood thank you operator thank you very much well proceed with our final question for today from the line of bill katz of credit suisse go right ahead q good morning this is ph michael kelly on for bill thank you for taking my question most questions have been asked but i did have one followup on the loan mix paul and paul are you seeing any shift in demand for the sbl looks like on the end of period basis they dipped a little bit the revenue was pretty resilient but are you seeing any shift in demand with the higher interest rate environment that we should be worried about near term i understand your longterm outlook is quite positive for the balance sheet in general paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think that yes some of that sbl dip was really a lot of people use that as gaap funding so part of the mortgage demand where people went from sbl to pay those off and id say mortgaged homes and other things so we think the demand is there and not only is it there for our clients i think tristate is growing their market share with new relationships too as a huge opportunity so i think sbls over time are still even short term and longer term still very very positive the question becomes as the rates continue to go up when was that really cheap source of funding maybe not people are less likely to borrow but i still think that business is doing well so i think you see a blip saw a blip this quarter really on that q great thanks and then if id just add one more followup as a percentage of aua you still are the sbls as a percentage of aua behind some of your wirehouse peers do you see that gap closing over time paul c reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 weve just never been as aggressive in pushing debt through our organization i mean that so our products sbl is even a relatively new product for us compared to our competitors so and we certainly dont have quotas for anyone to present it or require them to present or even branch managers with quotas so because of that our debt concentration historically has been lower than certainly our wirehouse competitors and we continue to gain share but we do it more through natural means and the advisor really has to initiate that versus us going out and pushing it or selling it to advisors so but our its going up but were just not aggressive in that havent been its just part of the culture for a long time q great thank you makes sense operator thank you very much and mr reilly that was the final question ill turn it back to you for any closing remarks paul c reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well great appreciate everybody being on the call and although a very strong end of the year its the environment outside of the equity markets and interest rates and cash sorting and everything else so its hard to call were still thats when we really appreciate the flexibility we have in the balance sheet our capital base and everything else to be able to navigate so optimistic about the future dont know whats going to happen as you get gdp and you get people still raising rates and inflation its going to be an interesting quarter a couple of quarters but thats when you can see that our advisors are still clients stay satisfied with our advisors is pretty high rate and they need them more now than ever so with that appreciate your time and well talk to you soon operator thank you very much and thank you everyone
