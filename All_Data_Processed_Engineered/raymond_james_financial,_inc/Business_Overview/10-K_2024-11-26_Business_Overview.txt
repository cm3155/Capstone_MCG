supervision as well as a high degree of scrutiny from various regulators in recent years regulatory supervisory and investigatory activity has increased and may continue to increase penalties and fines imposed by regulatory and other governmental authorities have also been substantial and growing in recent years following the most recent us federal elections there is an increased likelihood of changes to the regulatory environment and uncertainties about the timing and breadth of changes to various provisions of the tax cut and jobs act tcja which will expire in if not extended these changes could have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in the future however we cannot predict the exact changes or quantify their potential impacts see item risk factors of this s in certain states virtually all aspects of our asset management business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations these laws and regulations are primarily intended for the benefit of our clients antimoney laundering economic sanctions and antibribery and corruption regulation the us bank secrecy act bsa as amended by the usa patriot act of patriot act the customer due diligence rule and the antimoney laundering act of amla contains antimoney laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations applicable to all financial institutions including standards for verifying client identification at account opening and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities through these and other provisions the bsa the patriot act and amla seek to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism money laundering or other suspicious activities antimoney laundering laws outside the us contain similar provisions the us treasurys office of foreign assets control administers economic and trade sanctions programs and enforces sanctions regulations with which all us persons must comply the eu as well as various countries have also adopted economic sanctions programs targeted at countries entities and individuals that are involved in terrorism hostilities embezzlement or human rights violations in addition various countries have adopted laws and regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act related to corrupt and illegal payments to and hiring practices with regard to government officials and others table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries table end the scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad and is subject to significant uncertainties that may be clarified only in the context of further regulatory guidance or enforcement proceedings rjf and its affiliates have implemented and maintain internal policies procedures and controls to meet the compliance obligations imposed by such us and nonus laws and regulations concerning antimoney laundering economic sanctions and antibribery and corruption failure to continue to meet the requirements of these regulations could result in supervisory action including fines privacy and data protection us federal law establishes minimum federal standards for financial privacy by among other provisions requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information us state laws and regulations adopted under us federal law impose obligations on rjf and its subsidiaries for protecting the confidentiality integrity and availability of client information and require notice of data breaches to certain us regulators and to clients the fair credit reporting act of as amended mandates the development and implementation of a written identity theft prevention program that is designed to detect prevent and mitigate identity theft the california privacy rights act cpra amended the california consumer privacy act of and became enforceable in cpra regulations updated existing privacy protections for the personal information of california residents including by requiring companies to provide certain additional disclosures to california consumers and provide for a number of specific additional data subject rights for california residents similarly the eu and uk general data protection regulation gdpr imposes requirements for companies that collect or store personal data of eu residents as well as residents of the uk gdprs legal requirements extend to all foreign companies that solicit and process personal data of eu and uk residents imposing a strict data protection compliance regime that includes consumer rights actions that must be responded to by organizations canadian data privacy laws contain many provisions similar to us financial privacy laws and are currently undergoing

noncompliance and became fully effective in september in may the sec adopted amendments to regulation sp which includes a requirement for brokerdealers investment companies rias and transfer agents to adopt written policies and procedures for an incident response program with respect to unauthorized access to or use of customer information the final amendments require these entities to notify individuals whose sensitive customer information was accessed or used without authorization no later than days after becoming aware that the information has been compromised these amendments become effective on december and are not expected to have a significant impact on our business certain us states have recently enacted privacy and data protection regulation related to the development and deployment of artificial intelligence ai these laws intersect with existing privacy laws and present challenges for firms using airelated technologies particularly in cases where personal information is processed requiring notice disclosure and in certain cases consent for use of ai the eu artificial intelligence act which has tiered compliance dates poses further challenges for organizations in managing transparency fairness and accountability for ai use data privacy requirements affect business processes and compel companies to track personal information use and provide greater transparency on data practices to consumers the multitude of data privacy laws and regulations adds complexity and cost to managing compliance and data management capabilities and can result in potential litigation regulatory fines and reputational harm we have implemented policies processes and training with regard to communicating to our clients and business partners required information relating to
