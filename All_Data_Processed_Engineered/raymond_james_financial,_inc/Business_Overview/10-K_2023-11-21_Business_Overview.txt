financial services industry is intensely competitive we compete with many other financial services firms including a number of larger securities firms most of which are affiliated with major financial services companies insurance companies banking institutions and other organizations we also compete with companies that offer webbased financial services and discount brokerage services to individual clients usually with lower levels of service and more recently financial technology companies fintechs we compete principally on the basis of the quality of our associates services product selection performance records location and reputation in local markets our ability to compete effectively is substantially dependent on our continuing ability to develop or attract retain and motivate qualified financial advisors investment bankers trading professionals portfolio managers and other revenueproducing or specialized personnel furthermore the labor market continues to experience elevated levels

nontraditional competitors such as technology companies employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts upfront payments increased compensation and increased opportunities to work with greater flexibility including remote work on a permanent basis regulation we continue to experience an unprecedented and dramatic increase in the pace of rulemaking affecting financial and public company regulation and supervision as well as a high degree of scrutiny from various regulators recent events impacting the financial services industry including the failure of certain banks during our fiscal year have resulted in and may continue to result in changes to regulations applicable to bank holding companies regulatory supervisory and investigatory activity has increased and we expect it to continue to increase penalties and fines imposed by regulatory and other governmental authorities have also been substantial and growing in recent years these changes in as well as any further expansion of business regulations could result in increased compliance costs further any regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in the future however we cannot predict the exact changes or quantify their
