item risk factors our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described in the following sections which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations liquidity and the trading price of our common stock the list of risk factors provided in the following sections is not exhaustive there may be other factors that adversely impact our results of operations harm our reputation or inhibit our ability to generate new business prospects the following sections should be read in conjunction with item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k in particular see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk and item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management for additional information on our exposure and how we monitor and manage our market credit operational compliance and certain other risks risks related to our business and industry the worldwide covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the worldwide covid19 pandemic and related governmentimposed and other measures intended to control the spread of the disease including restrictions on travel and the conduct of business such as stayathome orders quarantines travel bans border closings business closures and other similar measures have had a significant impact on global economic conditions and have negatively impacted certain aspects of our business and results of operations and may continue to do so in the future although certain economic conditions showed signs of improvement toward the end of fiscal certain of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic may continue to affect our results in the future including lower net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks due to a significant reduction by the federal reserve of its benchmark shortterm interest rate in response to the pandemic volatility in our brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues due to market uncertainty caused by the pandemic increased credit risk particularly with regard to industries most vulnerable to the pandemic eg airline restaurant gaming entertainmentleisure and energy which may continue to result in an elevated bank loan loss provision and chargeoffs in addition should market conditions deteriorate further or if there is a decline in equity markets similar to that experienced during our fiscal second quarter the value of our clients assets and certain of our investments would also be negatively affected we may also continue to experience business disruptions as a result of the continued spread of covid19 resulting from restrictions on our employees ability to travel as well as temporary partial or full closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers suppliers or other vendors we often recruit skilled professionals by visiting their offices or having them visit our offices although we have transitioned such visits to virtual meetings continued travel restrictions or other disruptions that prevent us from meeting with professional prospects may adversely impact our ability to recruit such professional prospects further the increased availability of remote working arrangements in response to the pandemic may intensify competition for prospective new associates and impair our ability to retain current associates it may also become more difficult to maintain our distinctive corporate culture which is in part dependent on a certain level of inperson interaction in the face of a prolonged largescale industry shift to remote work while we maintain contingency plans for events such as pandemic outbreaks the further spread of covid19 or a similar contagious disease could also impair the effectiveness of our executive officers or other associates who are necessary to conduct our business in addition any continued spread of covid19 or new outbreak could harm the operations of thirdparty service providers who perform critical services for our business if covid19 or another highly infectious or contagious disease continues to spread or the response to contain it is unsuccessful we will likely experience further adverse effects on our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations a prolonged period of economic deterioration could ultimately result in impairment of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in addition if conditions in financial markets further deteriorate as a result of the pandemic our access to capital and other sources of funding may become constrained which may require us to restructure debt or obtain additional financing on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive the extent of any of the previouslydescribed effects on our business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the duration of the covid19 pandemic the development distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine the measures taken by various governmental authorities in response to the pandemic and the possible further impacts on the global economy raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries damage to our reputation could damage our businesses maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients investors and associates if we fail to address or appear to fail to address issues that may give rise to reputational risk we could significantly harm our business prospects these issues may include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item including appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest legal and regulatory requirements ethical issues money laundering cybersecurity and privacy recordkeeping sales and trading practices and associate misconduct in addition the failure to sell securities we have underwritten at anticipated price levels and the proper identification of the risks inherent in the products and services we offer could also give rise to reputational risk failure to maintain appropriate service and quality standards or a failure or perceived failure to treat clients fairly can result in client dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and reputational harm negative publicity about us whether or not true may also harm our reputation further failures at other large financial institutions or other market participants regardless of whether they relate to our activities could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the financial system in general we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets we are engaged in various financial services businesses as such we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions as well as economic output levels interest and inflation rates employment levels prices of commodities consumer confidence levels international trade policy and fiscal and monetary policy for example fed policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments the market impact from such policies also can decrease materially the value of certain of our financial assets most notably debt securities as well as our cash flows such as those associated with client cash balances changes in fed policies are beyond our control and consequently the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict in addition our results of operations may be impacted by changes resulting from different political philosophies governing individual and corporate taxation as well as regulation which may result from the outcome of the recent federal elections in the us changes in tax law and regulation or any market uncertainty caused by a change in the political environment may negatively affect our business macroeconomic conditions may also directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results including trading levels investing and origination activity in the securities markets financial instrument valuations the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates real estate values the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits in recent years we experienced an operating environment that was favorable for many of our businesses characterized by rising equity markets and higher levels of interest rates however the recent significant reduction by the fed of its benchmark shortterm interest rate including to ameliorate the macroeconomic effects of the covid19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on our results as we have certain assets and liabilities primarily held in our pcg rj bank and other segments which are sensitive to changes in interest rates fees we earn from thirdparty banks on client cash balances swept to such banks as part of the rjbdp are also sensitive to changes in interest rates these market interest rate declines will continue to negatively impact our results and cash flows in future quarters in addition if we were to experience a period of sustained downturn in the securities markets credit market dislocations reductions in the value of real estate further increases in mortgage and other loan delinquencies or other negative market factors including from the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic our revenues could be adversely impacted market volatility could also cause clients to move their investments to lower margin products or withdraw them which could have an adverse impact on our profitability we could also experience a material reduction in trading volume and lower securities prices in times of market uncertainty which would result in lower brokerage revenues including losses on firm inventory conversely periods of severe market volatility may result in a significantly higher level of transactions and other activity which may cause operational challenges that may result in losses these can include but are not limited to trade errors failed transaction settlements late collateral calls to borrowers and counterparties or interruptions to our system processing the fair values of certain of our investments could also be negatively impacted resulting in additional unrealized or realized losses on such investments periods of reduced revenue and other losses could lead to reduced profitability because certain of our expenses including our interest expense on debt rent facilities and salary expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce them over short time periods is limited us markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in other parts of the world our businesses and revenues derived from nonus operations may also be subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations social or political instability less established regulatory regimes changes in governmental or central bank policies downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative economic and raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries political developments concerns about brexit and the stability of the eus sovereign debt could cause uncertainty and disruption in financial markets globally continued uncertainties loom over the future of the uks relationship with the eu including future trading arrangements between the uk and the eu following the expiration of the transition period on december during the transition period of brexit we are taking steps to make certain changes to our european operations in an effort to ensure that where possible we can continue to provide crossborder services in eu member states without the need for separate regulatory authorizations in each member state there is also continued uncertainty regarding the outcome of the eus financial support programs it is possible that other eu member states may experience financial troubles in the future or may choose to follow the uks lead and leave the eu any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these developments could adversely affect our business financial condition and liquidity we may be negatively impacted by budget pressures affecting us state and local governments as well as negative trends in the housing and labor markets including those resulting directly or indirectly from the covid19 pandemic investor concerns regarding these trends could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and in turn reduce our debt underwriting revenues in addition such factors could potentially have an adverse effect on the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading inventory rj bank is affected primarily by economic conditions in north america market conditions in the us and canada can be assessed through the following metrics the level and volatility of interest rates unemployment and underemployment rates real estate prices consumer confidence levels and changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies among others deterioration of market conditions such as those we have experienced due to the covid19 pandemic have and could continue to diminish loan demand which may result in sales of loans at unattractive prices in order to reduce risk in our loan portfolio lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies affect loan repayment performance and result in higher loan loss provisions and net chargeoffs which can adversely affect our earnings lack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition our inability to maintain adequate liquidity or to easily access credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition if liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations such as limiting our recruiting of additional financial advisors limiting lending selling assets at unfavorable prices and cutting or eliminating dividend payments our liquidity could be negatively affected by the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings liquidity or capital requirements applicable to our subsidiaries that may prevent us from distributing cash to the parent company limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries diminished access to the capital markets for rjf and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements judgments or regulatory sanctions furthermore as a bank holding company we may become subject to prohibitions or limitations on our ability to pay dividends andor repurchase our stock certain of our regulators have the authority and under certain circumstances the duty to prohibit or to limit dividend payments by regulated subsidiaries to their parent company the availability of financing including access to the credit and capital markets depends on various factors such as conditions in the debt and equity markets the general availability of credit the volume of securities trading activity the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings our cost of capital and the availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads additionally lenders may from time to time curtail or even cease to provide funding to borrowers as a result of future concerns over the strength of specific counterparties as well as the stability of markets generally we are exposed to credit risk we are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will fail to meet their obligations to us due to numerous causes including bankruptcy lack of liquidity or operational failure among others this risk has been and may further be exacerbated by the effects of the covid19 pandemic we actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our brokerdealers trading and underwriting businesses which exposes us to credit risk although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction we still face risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date we also hold certain securities loans and derivatives as part of our trading operations deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans or the nonperformance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivatives could result in losses we borrow securities from and lend securities to other brokerdealers and may also enter into agreements to repurchase andor resell securities as part of investing and financing activities a sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments we manage the risk raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits as well as by evaluating collateral and transaction levels on a recurring basis significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to widespread concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating our credit risk in addition we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin during periods of steep declines in securities prices the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchasers indebtedness if clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans we may incur losses on those margin transactions this may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults we deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients a failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity result in significant reputational damage and adversely impact our financial performance we also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals including through offering ci loans commercial and residential mortgage loans taxexempt loans home equity lines of credit sbl and other loans we also incur credit risk through our investments our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities industries or geographies or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions such as those most impacted by the covid19 pandemic including the airline restaurant gaming entertainmentleisure and energy sectors the deterioration of an individually large exposure for example due to natural disasters health emergencies or pandemics acts of terrorism severe weather events or other adverse economic events could lead to additional loan loss provisions andor chargesoffs or credit impairment of our investments and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in rj banks portfolio sell loans at unattractive prices foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our securities credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the us economy we are exposed to market risk including interest rate risk we are directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions for example interest rate changes could adversely affect our net interest spread the difference between the yield we earn on our interestearning assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities moreover while there is no indication currently that the fed plans to reduce its targeted fed funds rate to a negative rate if such a policy were to be adopted the cost to hold both firm and client deposits would have an adverse impact on our profitability in our brokerage operations a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread and an increase in servicing fees received on cash swept to thirdparty banks as part of the rjbdp our multibank sweep program conversely in those operations a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread and lower rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks if we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans deposits securities shortterm borrowings longterm debt trading account assets and liabilities derivatives and private equity investments market conditions that change from time to time thereby exposing us to market risk include fluctuations in interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer in addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of security positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increase the level of riskweighted assets on our balance sheet thereby increasing our capital requirements which could have an adverse effect on our business results financial condition and liquidity our private equity investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings the value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our investments can be volatile and difficult to predict when and if we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions the prospects of the companies in which we invest if these companies go public and the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries significant volatility in our domestic clients cash balances could negatively impact our net revenues andor our ability to fund rj banks growth and may impact our regulatory ratios the majority of rj banks deposits are primarily driven by the rjbdp our multibank sweep program in which pcg clients cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are swept into fdicinsured interestbearing deposit accounts at rj bank and various thirdparty banks the rjbdp is a source of relatively lowcost stable deposits for rj bank and we rely heavily on the rjbdp to fund rj banks asset growth a significant reduction in pcg clients cash balances a change in the allocation of that cash between rj bank and thirdparty banks within the rjbdp or a transfer of cash away from the firm could significantly impact rj banks ability to continue growing interestearning assets andor require rj bank to use highercost deposit sources to grow interestearning assets the rjbdp also generates service fee income from thirdparty banks related to the deposits they receive through their participation in the rjbdp if pcg clients were to materially increase their cash balances at a time when thirdparty bank demand for rjbdp deposits has been largely met our ability to generate meaningful revenues from the placement of these incremental deposits would be adversely affected in addition our inability to deploy client cash to thirdparty banks through rjbdp would require us to retain more cash at rj bank or in our client interest program both of which may cause a significant increase in our assets such an increase in our assets may negatively impact certain of our regulatory ratios our business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products fees earned from the management of client accounts and asset management fees a large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues business and financial condition in addition if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions we may receive lower fee revenue from the distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual fund and annuity companies the asset management fees we are paid are dependent upon the value of client assets in feebased accounts in our pcg segment as well as aum in our asset management segment the value of our feebased assets and aum is impacted by market fluctuations and inflows or outflows of assets as our pcg clients increasingly show a preference for feebased accounts over traditional transactionbased accounts a larger portion of our client assets are more directly impacted by market movements therefore in periods of declining market values the values of feebased accounts and aum may resultantly decline which would negatively impact our revenues in addition belowmarket investment performance by our funds portfolio managers or financial advisors could result in reputational damage that might cause outflows or make it more difficult to attract new investors into our asset management products and thus further impact our business and financial condition our asset management fees may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition and the renegotiation of contracts in addition the market environment in recent years has resulted in a shift to passive investment products which generate lower fees than actively managed products a continued trend toward passive investments or changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would negatively affect our revenues business and financial condition our underwriting marketmaking trading and other business activities place our capital at risk we may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that for any reason we are unable to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels as an underwriter we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings in which we are involved from time to time as part of our underwriting processes we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry sudden changes in the value of these positions despite our risk mitigation policies could impact our financial results as a market maker we may own positions in specific securities and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified despite risk mitigation policies we may incur losses as a result of positions we hold in connection with our trading activities we have made and to the limited extent permitted by applicable regulations may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments we may be unable to realize our investment objectives if we cannot sell or otherwise dispose of our interests at attractive prices or complete a desirable exit strategy in particular these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made changes in economic conditions or changes in laws regulations fiscal policies or political conditions it could take a substantial period of raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments in addition even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cash any cyberattack or other security breach of our technology systems or those of our clients or other thirdparty vendors we rely on could subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation our operations rely heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of sensitive and confidential financial personal and other information in our computer systems and networks there have been several highly publicized cases involving financial services companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or other confidential information in recent years as well as cyberattacks involving the theft dissemination and destruction of corporate information or other assets in some cases as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties like other financial services firms we experience malicious cyber activity directed at our computer systems software networks and its users on a daily basis this malicious activity includes attempts at unauthorized access implantation of computer viruses or malware and denialofservice attacks we also experience large volumes of phishing and other forms of social engineering attempted for the purpose of perpetrating fraud against the firm our associates or our clients additionally like many large enterprises since midmarch we have shifted the majority of our associates to remote work arrangements in response to the covid19 pandemic this change in our operating model has enabled us to successfully continue business operations but also introduces potential new vulnerabilities to cyber threats we seek to continuously monitor for and nimbly react to any and all such malicious cyber activity and we develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misuse misappropriation or corruption cyberattacks can originate from a variety of sources including third parties affiliated with foreign governments organized crime or terrorist organizations third parties may also attempt to place individuals within our firm or induce employees clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent although cybersecurity incidents among financial services firms are on the rise we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches however the techniques used in these attacks are increasingly sophisticated change frequently and are often not recognized until launched although we seek to maintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls including our cyber threat analytics data encryption and tokenization technologies antimalware defenses and vulnerability management programs any one or combination of these controls could fail to detect mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to human error equipment failure natural disasters power loss spam attacks unauthorized access distributed denial of service attacks computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could result in significant liability and damage to our reputation and have an ongoing impact on the security and stability of our operations we also rely on numerous thirdparty service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and we face similar risks relating to them while we regularly conduct security assessments on these thirdparty vendors we cannot be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach in addition in order to access our products and services our customers may use computers and other devices that are beyond our security control systems notwithstanding the precautions we take if a cyberattack or other information security breach were to occur this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations or those of our clients and counterparties exposing us to liability as attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication we may be required to expend substantial additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to communicate about cyberattacks to our customers though we have insurance against some cyberrisks and attacks we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators further successful cyberattacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants whether or not we are affected could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our financial products and services further in light of the high volume of transactions we process the large number of our clients partners and counterparties the increasing sophistication of malicious actors and our remote work environment in response to the covid19 pandemic a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection we expect that any investigation of a cyberattack would take substantial amounts of time and that there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries information during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all of which would further increase the costs and consequences of such an attack we may also be subject to liability under various data protection laws in providing services to clients we manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including personal data as a result we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as us federal state and international laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number if any person including any of our associates negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in addition unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through system failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages a continued interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems or the failure to effectively update the technology we utilize could be materially adverse to our business our businesses rely extensively on data processing and communications systems in addition to better serving clients the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements client needs and competitive demands is critical for our business introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis there are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standards our continued success depends in part upon our ability to i successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our technology systems on a regular basis ii maintain the quality of the information contained in our data processing and communications systems iii address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and iv retain skilled information technology employees failure of our technology systems which could result from events beyond our control including a systems malfunction or cyberattack failure by a thirdparty service provider or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technologydriven products or services could result in financial losses liability to clients violations of applicable privacy and other applicable laws and regulatory sanctions the soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us we face the risk of operational failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents exchanges clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities and derivative transactions as a result of regulatory changes and the consolidation over the years among clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and costeffective alternatives should the need arise any failure termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions service our clients and manage our exposure to risk our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be affected adversely by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interdependent as a result of trading clearing funding counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients defaults by or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have historically led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us losses arising in connection with counterparty defaults may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk we seek to manage monitor and control our market credit operational liquidity and legal and regulatory compliance risk through operational and compliance reporting systems internal controls management review processes and other mechanisms however there can be no assurance that our procedures will be effective while we use limits and other risk mitigation techniques those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot always anticipate unforeseen economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes our risk management methods may not predict future risk exposures effectively in addition some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate or may have limited predictive value a failure to manage our growth adequately including growth in the products or services we offer or to manage our risk effectively could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition financial services firms are subject to numerous actual or perceived conflicts of interest which are routinely examined by us federal and state regulators and sros such as finra and are often used as the basis for claims for legal liability by plaintiffs in actions against us our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities a perceived or actual failure to address conflicts of interest adequately could affect our reputation the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could result in material harm to our business and financial condition we continue to experience pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitability we continue to experience pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading in the fixed income market regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency leading to price competition and decreased trading margins in the equity market we experience pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions partially due to the industry trend toward the separate payment for research and execution services our trading margins have been further compressed by the shift from high to lowtouch execution services which has created additional competitive pressure we believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees commissions or margins we face intense competition we are engaged in intensely competitive businesses we compete on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of our associates our products and services pricing such as execution pricing and fee levels and location and reputation in relevant markets over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors see item business competition of this form 10k for additional information about our competitors we compete directly with other national full service brokerdealers investment banking firms commercial banks and investment advisors and to a lesser extent with discount brokers and dealers in addition we face competition from more recent entrants into the market including financial technology companies and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms for example recently several commercial firms and other nontraditional competitors have applied for banking licenses or have entered into partnerships with banks to provide banking services we also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies real estate firms and hedge funds among others this competition could cause our business to suffer to remain competitive our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services the inability to develop new products and services or enhance existing offerings could have a material adverse effect on our profitability in addition we may incur substantial expenditures to keep pace with the constant changes and enhancements being made in technology our ability to attract and retain senior professionals qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our business our ability to recruit serve and retain our clients depends on the reputation judgment leadership business generation capabilities and client service skills of our clientserving professionals members of our executive committees as well as raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries employees who support revenuegenerating professionals and their clients to compete effectively we must attract develop and retain qualified professionals including successful financial advisors investment bankers trading professionals portfolio managers and other revenueproducing or specialized personnel competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity turnover in the financial services industry is high the cost of recruiting and retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry is considerable financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts upfront payments and increased compensation these can be important factors in a current associates decision to leave us as well as in a prospective associates decision to join us as competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense we may have to devote significant resources to attract and retain qualified personnel to the extent we have compensation targets we may not be able to retain our associates which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional associates at compensation levels that are not within our target range in particular our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel if we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers senior equity research sales and trading professionals asset managers or executive officers to a competitor or otherwise we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services if we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals our reputation business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected further new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues moreover companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices we have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel some of whom may work for our competitors some of these claims may result in material litigation we could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims regardless of their merits such claims could also discourage potential associates who work for our competitors from joining us we participate in the protocol for broker recruiting protocol a voluntary agreement among many firms in the industry that governs among other things the client information that financial advisors may take with them when they affiliate with a new firm the ability to bring such customer data to a new brokerdealer generally means that the clients of the financial advisor are more likely to choose to open accounts at the advisors new firm participation is voluntary and it is possible that certain of our competitors will withdraw from the protocol if the brokerdealers from whom we recruit new financial advisors prevent or significantly limit the transfer of client data our recruiting efforts may be adversely affected and we could continue to experience claims against us relating to our recruiting efforts a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our operations earnings and financial condition if our credit ratings were downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged and as a result adversely affect our client relationships such a change in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position increase our borrowing costs limit our access to the capital markets trigger obligations under certain financial agreements or decrease the number of investors clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability we may not be able to obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms or at all the impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in certain of our derivative instruments and may result in a request for immediate payment andor ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions a credit rating downgrade would also result in the firm incurring a higher facility fee on its million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement the credit facility in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on the line as of and subsequent to such downgrade see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for information on the credit facility business growth could increase costs and regulatory and integration risks we continue to grow including through acquisitions and through our recruiting efforts integrating acquired businesses providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges we may incur significant expense in connection with expanding our existing businesses recruiting financial advisors or making strategic acquisitions or investments our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues derived from such investments or growth raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries expansion may also create a need for additional compliance documentation risk management and internal control procedures and often involves hiring additional personnel to address these procedures to the extent such procedures are not adequate or not adhered to with respect to our expanded business or any new business we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction moreover to the extent we pursue acquisitions we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms we may be unable to integrate any acquired business into our existing business successfully difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may need to raise capital or borrow funds in order to finance an acquisition which could result in dilution or increased leverage we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or perhaps at all associate misconduct which is difficult to detect and deter could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm there is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business for example our investment banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients our associates interact with clients customers and counterparties on an ongoing basis all associates are expected to exhibit the behaviors and ethics that are reflected in our framework of principles policies and technology to protect both our own information as well as that of our clients associate conduct on nonbusiness matters such as social issues could be inconsistent with the companys policies and ethics and result in reputational harm to our business as a result of their employment or affiliation if our associates improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients we could be subject to future regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation financial position current client relationships and ability to attract future clients we are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over our assets under management in addition our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity providing financial planning investment advice and discretionary asset management the violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us it is not always possible to deter or prevent every instance of associate misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases if our associates engage in misconduct our business would be adversely affected we are exposed to litigation risks which could materially and adversely impact our business operations and prospects many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of liability we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits and arbitrations primarily involving claims for damages the risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could also result in substantial liability in challenging market conditions the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have historically increased litigation risks include potential liability under securities laws or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions issues related to our investment recommendations including the suitability of such recommendations or potential concentration of investments the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions contractual issues employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial impact or cause us significant reputational harm which in turn could seriously harm our business and future business prospects in addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time the amount of thirdparty attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations see item legal proceedings of this form 10k for further information about legal matters the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported results the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain one of our most critical estimates is rj banks allowance for loan losses at any given point in time conditions in real estate and credit markets may increase the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if managements underlying raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses our financial condition including our liquidity and capital and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted our financial instruments including certain trading assets and liabilities derivatives availableforsale securities certain loans and investments among other items require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements where quoted market prices are not available we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our subjective judgment some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no directly observable inputs making their valuation particularly subjective and consequently based on estimation and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment as well as declines in our earnings in subsequent periods our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations the financial accounting standards board the fasb and the sec have at times revised the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating priorperiod financial statements for further discussion of our significant accounting estimates policies and standards see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates and item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent accounting developments of this form 10k and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditions certain of our principal operations are located in st petersburg florida while we have a business continuity plan that also permits significant operations to be conducted out of remote locations as well as our southfield michigan and memphis tennessee corporate offices and our information systems processing to be conducted out of our information technology data center in the denver colorado area our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions communications and the ability of our associates to get to our offices or work from home in addition since activating certain aspects of our business continuity plan in response to the covid19 pandemic to allow nearly all of our associates to work remotely our associates ability to relocate to a secondary location in the event of a power outage or other disruption is limited due to the pandemic as previously mentioned weather events could also adversely impact certain loans within rj banks portfolio the phaseout of libor could negatively impact our net interest income and require significant operational work the fca which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to libor after it is likely that banks will not continue to provide submissions for the calculation of libor after and possibly prior to then the discontinuance of libor has resulted in significant uncertainty regarding the transition to suitable alternative reference rates and could adversely impact our business operations and financial results although the full impact of transition remains unclear this change may have an adverse impact on the value of return on and trading markets for a broad array of financial products including any liborbased securities loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities if libor is discontinued after as expected there will be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments which may also impact our net interest income and account and service fees in addition libor may perform differently during the phaseout period than in the past which could result in lower interest earned on certain assets and a reduction in the value of certain assets to facilitate an orderly transition away from libor we have established an enterprisewide initiative to assess and implement necessary changes to our contracts systems processes documentation and models these changes may also impact our existing transaction data products internal infrastructure and valuation processes we are exposed to risks related to our insurance programs our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance selfinsured retention and selfinsurance for a number of risks we have elected to selfinsure our errors and omissions liability and raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries our employeerelated health care benefit plans we have selfinsured retention risk related to our property and casualty workers compensation and general liability benefit plans while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage appropriate to our risk assessment we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages our business may be negatively affected if our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable in addition claims associated with risks we have retained either through our selfinsurance retention or by selfinsuring may exceed our recorded reserves which could negatively impact future earnings insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our business risks related to our regulatory environment financial services firms are highly regulated and such regulation may increase the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions financial services firms operate in an evolving regulatory environment the industry has experienced an extended period of significant change in laws and regulations governing the financial services industry as well as a high degree of scrutiny from various regulators including the sec the fed the occ and the cfpb in addition to stock exchanges finra and state attorneys general for example the doddfrank act resulted in sweeping changes to the regulatory regime including a significant increase in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry penalties and fines imposed by regulatory authorities have been substantial in recent years we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws rules and regulations existing and new laws and regulations could affect our revenue limit our ability to pursue business opportunities impact the value of our assets require us to alter at least some of our business practices impose additional compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect our businesses there is also increased regulatory scrutiny and related compliance costs as we continue to grow and surpass certain consolidated asset thresholds established under the doddfrank act which have the effect of imposing enhanced standards and requirements on larger institutions these include but are not limited to rj banks oversight by the cfpb any action taken by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services make such products and services less attractive impose additional compliance measures or result in fines penalties or required remediation we are also required to comply with the volcker rules provisions although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of proprietary trading due to our underwriting and trading activities and our investments in covered funds we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased operational and compliance costs and changes to our private equity investments any changes to regulations or changes to the supervisory approach may also result in increased compliance costs to the extent we are required to modify our existing compliance policies procedures and practices brokerdealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business including but not limited to sales and trading methods trade practices among brokerdealers use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities capital structure of securities firms antimoney laundering efforts recordkeeping and the conduct of directors officers and employees any violation of these laws or regulations could subject us to the following events any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects civil and criminal liability sanctions which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries registrations as investment advisors or brokerdealers the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors censures fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business the majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we have certain international business operations that are subject to laws regulations and standards in the countries in which we operate any violations of these laws regulations or standards could subject us to a range of potential regulatory events or outcomes that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects including potential adverse impacts on continued operations in the relevant international jurisdiction regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations there is no assurance that regulators will be satisfied with the policies and procedures implemented by rjf and its subsidiaries in addition from time to time rjf and its subsidiaries may become subject to additional findings with respect to supervisory compliance or other regulatory deficiencies which could subject us to additional liability including penalties and restrictions on our business activities among other things these restrictions could limit our ability to make investments complete acquisitions expand into new raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries business lines pay dividends on our common stock andor engage in share repurchases see item business regulation of this form 10k for additional information regarding our regulatory environment changes in requirements relating to the standard of conduct for brokerdealers applicable under federal and state law have increased our costs in june the sec adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations related to the provision of advice by brokerdealers and investment advisers including regulation best interest since june regulation best interest requires among other things a brokerdealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation to that customer of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities the regulation imposes heightened standards on brokerdealers and we have incurred substantial costs in order to review and modify our policies and procedures including associated supervisory and compliance controls we anticipate that we will continue to incur costs in the future to comply with the standard in addition to the sec various states have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations seeking to impose new standards of conduct on brokerdealers that as written differ from the secs new regulations and may lead to additional implementation costs implementation of the new sec regulations as well as any new state rules that are adopted addressing similar matters has resulted in and may continue to result in increased costs related to compliance legal operations and information technology numerous regulatory changes and enhanced regulatory and enforcement activity relating to our investment management activities may increase our compliance and legal costs and otherwise adversely affect our business as some of our whollyowned subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the sec increased regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in additional operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities while it is not possible to determine the extent of the longterm impact of any new laws or regulations that have been promulgated or initiatives that have been or may be proposed even the shortterm impact of preparing for or implementing changes to our infrastructure and processes could negatively impact the ways we conduct business and increase our compliance and legal costs conformance with any new law or regulations could also make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect our product and service offerings investment management businesses have been affected by the secs regulation best interest which in addition to creating a standard of care a financial advisor owes its clients also impacts investment advice provided by investment advisers the result has been increased scrutiny within the industry regarding how advisory products are offered and sold such changes could impact our revenues and profitability in addition the sec and other regulators continue to scrutinize brokerdealer platforms with respect to mutual funds for example the secs wellpublicized share class selection disclosure initiative has required raymond james affiliated brokerdealers and others to make changes to the availability of mutual funds and mutual fund share classes on their distribution platforms such changes could impact mutual fund sales including those sponsored by our subsidiaries and affect our profitability in addition us and foreign governments have taken regulatory actions impacting the investment management industry and may continue to do so including expanding current or enacting new standards requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries for example mifid ii in the eu requires the use of hard dollars for research as opposed to the use of soft dollars where a portion of commissions paid to brokerdealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors the research relied on in our investment management activities in the investment decisionmaking process is typically generated internally by our investment analysts or external research including external research paid for with soft dollars this external research is generally used for information gathering or verification purposes and includes brokerprovided research as well as thirdparty provided databases and research services if the use of soft dollars were to become limited in the us we may have to bear some of these additional costs new regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products including additional recordkeeping and disclosure requirements may also impact our asset management business and result in increased costs failure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to rjf rj bank or our brokerdealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our business as discussed in item business regulation of this form 10k rjf and rj bank are subject to capital requirements administered by various federal regulators in the us and accordingly must meet specific capital guidelines that involve raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries quantitative measures of rjf and rj banks assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory guidelines failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and potentially discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could harm either rjf or rj banks operations and financial condition further we are subject to the secs uniform net capital rule rule 15c31 and finras net capital rule which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our brokerdealer subsidiaries rj ltd is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulations in canada by iiroc additionally our us entities operating as nonbank custodians of individual retirement accounts iras must also satisfy certain internal revenue service irs regulations in order to accept new ira and qualified plans and retain the accounts for which it serves as nonbank custodian regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds that rjf may need to make payments on any of its obligations see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information on regulations and capital requirements the basel iii regulatory capital standards impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our profitability the fed the occ and the fdic have implemented the global regulatory capital reforms of basel iii and certain changes required by the doddfrank act the us basel iii rules increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital establish a capital conservation buffer and make selected changes to the calculation of riskweighted assets we became subject to the requirements under the final us basel iii rules as of january subject to a phasein period for several of its provisions including the new minimum capital ratio requirements the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions the capital requirements stipulated under the us basel iii rules could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected as a financial holding company rjfs liquidity depends on payments from its subsidiaries which may be subject to regulatory restrictions rjf as a financial holding company depends on dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations including its debt service obligations rjfs subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to prevent or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to rjf rjfs brokerdealers and bank subsidiary are limited in their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and are subject to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements as well as limitations on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses these requirements may hinder rjfs ability to access funds from its subsidiaries rjf may also become subject to a prohibition or limitations on its ability to pay dividends or repurchase its common stock the federal banking regulators including the occ the fed and the fdic as well as the sec through finra have the authority and under certain circumstances the obligation to limit or prohibit dividend payments and stock repurchases by the banking organizations they supervise including rjf and its bank subsidiaries rj bank is subject to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws and failure to comply with these laws could lead to penalties the cra the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act and other us federal fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions the us department of justice and other federal agencies including the cfpb are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations an unfavorable cra rating or a successful challenge to an institutions performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions including the required payment of damages and civil monetary penalties injunctive relief and the imposition of restrictions on mergers acquisitions and expansion activity private parties may also have the ability to challenge a financial institutions performance under fair lending laws by bringing private class action litigation as discussed in item business regulation of this form 10k certain amendments to the cra have not yet been finalized these developments create further uncertainty for rj bank and others in planning their cra activities any revisions to the final regulations that implement the cra may negatively impact our business including through increased costs related to compliance
