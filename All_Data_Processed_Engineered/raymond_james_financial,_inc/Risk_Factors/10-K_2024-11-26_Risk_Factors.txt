item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management for additional information on our exposure and how we monitor and manage our market credit liquidity operational model and compliance and certain other risks risks related to our business and industry damage to our reputation could damage our businesses maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients investors and associates if we fail to address or appear to fail to address issues that may give rise to reputational risk we could significantly harm our business prospects these issues may include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item including appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest legal and regulatory requirements fraud perpetrated against our clients ethical issues money laundering cybersecurity and privacy recordkeeping sales and trading practices and associate misconduct in addition the failure to either sell securities we have underwritten at anticipated price levels or to properly identify and communicate the risks inherent in the products and services we offer could also give rise to reputational risk a failure or perceived failure to maintain appropriate service and quality standards or to treat clients fairly can result in client dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and reputational harm negative publicity about us including information posted on social media or other internet forums or published by news organizations whether or not true may also harm our reputation the speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels in particular social media may magnify risk relating to negative publicity further failures at other large financial institutions or other market participants regardless of whether they relate to our activities could lead to a general loss table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries table end of client confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the financial system in general any cyberattack or other security breach of our technology systems or those of our clients or other thirdparty vendors we rely on could subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation our operations rely heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of sensitive and confidential financial personal and other information in our computer systems and networks there have been numerous highly publicized cases involving financial services companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or other confidential information in recent years as well as cyberattacks involving the theft dissemination and destruction of corporate information or other assets in some cases as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties there have also been numerous highly publicized cases where hackers have requested ransom payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems like other financial services firms we experience malicious cyber activity directed at our computer systems software networks and users on a daily basis this malicious activity includes attempts at unauthorized access implantation of computer viruses or malware and denialofservice attacks we also experience large volumes of phishing and other forms of social engineering attempted for the purpose of perpetrating fraud against the firm our associates or our clients additionally we may face increased cybersecurity risk for a period of time after acquisitions as we transition the acquired entitys historical systems and networks to our standards we also face increased cybersecurity risk related to mobile and cloud solutions or those related to new and emerging technologies such as ai we seek to continuously monitor for and nimbly react to any and all such malicious cyber activity and we develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misuse misappropriation or corruption cyberattacks can originate from a variety of sources including threat actors affiliated with foreign governments organized crime or terrorist organizations threat actors may also attempt to place individuals within our firm or induce employees clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent although cybersecurity incidents among financial services firms are on the rise we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches however the techniques used in these attacks are increasingly sophisticated change frequently and are often not recognized until launched although we seek to maintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls including our cyber threat analytics data encryption antimalware defenses and vulnerability management programs any one or combination of these controls could fail to detect mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to human error equipment failure natural disasters power loss unauthorized access supply chain attacks distributed denialofservice attacks computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could result in significant liability and damage to our reputation and have an ongoing impact on the security and stability of our operations in addition although we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to terms and conditions cover certain aspects of cyber and information security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses such as litigation costs or financial losses that exceed our policy limits or are not covered under any of our current insurance policies we also rely on numerous thirdparty service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and we face similar risks relating to them while we regularly conduct security assessments on these thirdparty vendors we cannot be certain that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach we also cannot be certain that we will receive timely notification of such cyberattacks or other security breaches in addition in order to access our products and services our clients independent contractor financial advisors and financial advisors associated with firms affiliated with us through our rcs division may use computers and other devices that are beyond our security control systems notwithstanding the precautions we take if a cyberattack or other information security breach were to occur this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations or those of our clients and counterparties exposing us to liability as attempted attacks continue to evolve in scope and sophistication we may be required to expend substantial additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to communicate about cyberattacks to our clients andor regulators a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators further successful cyberattacks at other large financial institutions or other market participants whether or not we are affected could lead to a general loss of confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our financial products and services further in light of the high volume of transactions we process the large number of our clients partners and counterparties and the increasing sophistication of malicious actors a cyberattack could occur moreover any such cyberattack may persist for table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries table end an extended period of time without detection we endeavor to design and implement policies and procedures to identify such cyberattacks as quickly as possible however we expect that any investigation of a cyberattack would take substantial amounts of time and that there may be extensive delays before we obtain full and reliable information during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all of which would further increase the costs and consequences of such an attack we may also be subject to liability under various data protection laws in providing services to clients we manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including personal data as a result we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as us federal state and international laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number if any person including any of our associates negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in addition unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through system failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages further lapses in cybersecurity controls as perceived by our regulators could lead to fines and penalties compounding monetary losses lack of funding liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial condition an inability to maintain adequate funding and liquidity to operate our business could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition we have a contingency funding plan which would guide our actions if one or more of our businesses were to experience disruptions from normal funding and liquidity sources if the available funding from one or more of our contingent funding sources is not sufficient to sustain normal operating levels we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations such as by limiting lending selling assets at unfavorable prices cutting or eliminating dividend payments or limiting our recruiting of financial advisors our liquidity could be negatively affected by any inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash to distribute to the parent company liquidity or capital requirements that may prevent our subsidiaries from distributing cash limitations on our subsidiaries access to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings diminished access to the capital markets for rjf and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements judgments regulatory sanctions or an adverse change in our credit rating by one or more of the national rating agencies furthermore as a bhc we may become subject to prohibitions or limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders andor repurchase our stock certain of our regulators have the authority and under certain circumstances the duty to prohibit or to limit dividend payments by regulated subsidiaries to their parent company the availability of financing including access to the credit and capital markets depends on various factors such as conditions in the debt and equity markets the general availability of credit the volume of securities trading activity the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings our cost of capital and the availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets wider credit spreads or our inability to pay a prevailing rate of interest that is competitive with other market offerings additionally lenders may from time to time curtail or even cease to provide funding to borrowers as a result of future concerns over the strength of specific counterparties as well as the stability of markets generally significant volatility in our clients cash sweep and bank deposit balances and higher costs in sourcing such balances could negatively affect our net revenues our bank segments growth and our regulatory capital ratios the rjbdp provides our bank segment with relatively lowcost stable deposits and we rely heavily on the rjbdp to fund our bank segment asset growth any significant reduction in pcg clients cash balances swept to the rjbdp a change in the allocation of that cash between our bank segment and thirdparty banks within the rjbdp a movement of cash away from the firm or an inability to implement new or modified deposit offerings could significantly impair our ability to continue growing interestearning assets andor require our bank segment to increase reliance on highercost deposit sources such as the esp and certain higheryield rjbdp offerings to clients or other sources of liquidity to grow interestearning assets additionally periods of higher interest rates have made and may continue to make investments in securities such as fixedincome securities and money market funds more attractive for investors thereby incentivizing them to reduce their cash balances with us we also earn fees from thirdparty banks on deposits they receive through the rjbdp if pcg clients cash balances decrease further or thirdparty bank demand or capacity for rjbdp deposits decline from current levels our rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks could decline in addition an inability to deploy client cash to thirdparty banks through rjbdp would require us table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries table end to retain more cash in our bank segment or in our client interest program cip both of which may cause a significant increase in our assets thereby negatively affecting certain of our regulatory capital ratios any increase to the rates we pay clients can reduce our earnings such increases may result from competitive industry dynamics as well as changes to rules or interpretations governing the fees we earn on cash sweep balances the esp provides a highyield deposit offering to our pcg clients and operates through a reciprocal deposit program which allows us to place deposits at thirdparty insured depository institutions in return for deposits received by our bank subsidiaries this program allows us to offer higher levels of fdic insurance to our clients if thirdparty bank capacity for reciprocal deposits declines or we are otherwise restricted from participating in this program we may have to reduce fdic insurance coverage on such deposits which may cause clients to withdraw deposits that exceed fdic insurance limits from our bank subsidiaries in such event we may have to pay higher interest rates to replace them with other sources of funding which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations in addition reciprocal deposit balances in excess of billion meet the fdic definition of brokered deposits such brokered deposits are subject to additional scrutiny from regulators incur higher fdic insurance costs and may also be viewed negatively by our rating agencies shareholders and other depositors we are exposed to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings which could materially and adversely impact our business operations and prospects the financial services industry faces significant litigation and regulatory risks additionally our litigation and regulatory risks continue to increase as our business grows both domestically and internationally many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of liability we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits and arbitrations primarily involving claims for damages the risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could also result in substantial liability in addition our business activities include providing custody clearing and back office support for certain nonaffiliated independent rias and brokerdealers even though these independent firms are exclusively responsible for their operations supervision compliance and the suitability of their clients investment decisions we have been and may in the future be named as defendants in litigation involving their clients we are also the subject of inquiries investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies in challenging market conditions the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have historically increased litigation risks include potential liability under securities laws or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions issues related to our investment recommendations including the suitability of such recommendations or potential concentration of investments the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions contractual issues employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial impact or cause us significant reputational harm which in turn could seriously harm our business and future business prospects in addition to financial costs and risks associated with potential liability the costs of defending litigation claims andor regulatory matters continue to increase over time the amount of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation claims andor regulatory matters could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations see item legal proceedings and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information about legal and regulatory matters our business is sensitive to domestic and international macroeconomic conditions caused by political and geopolitical developments fiscal monetary and tax policies regulations and other domestic or international events we are engaged in various financial services businesses as such we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions as well as economic output levels interest and inflation rates employment levels prices of commodities consumer confidence levels changes in consumer spending international trade policy and fiscal and monetary policy for example fed policies determine in large part interest rates and the cost of funds which directly affect the returns and fair value on our lending and investing activities the market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of certain of our financial assets most notably debt securities as well as our cash flows in addition our results of operations may be impacted by changes resulting from different political philosophies governing individual and corporate taxation as well as regulation which may result from the outcome of the recent federal elections in the us for example changes to tax laws and regulations including various provisions of the tax cut and jobs act tcja which will expire in if not extended may negatively impact our effective income tax rate financial results or the amount of any tax assets or liabilities changes in tax law and regulation or any market uncertainty caused by a change in the political environment may also affect our clients and directly or indirectly our business macroeconomic conditions may also be negatively affected by domestic or international events including natural disasters political unrest the indirect impact of wars table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries table end and conflicts such as the wars in ukraine and israel or public health epidemics and pandemics as well as by a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results if we were to experience a period of sustained downturn in the securities markets credit market dislocations reductions in the value of real estate increases in mortgage and other loan delinquencies or other negative market factors our revenues and the value of the assets we own could be adversely impacted market uncertainty could also cause clients to move their investments to lower margin products or withdraw them which could have an adverse impact on our profitability we could also experience a material reduction in trading volume and lower asset prices in times of market uncertainty which would result in lower brokerage revenues including losses on firm inventory as well as losses on certain of our investments conversely periods of severe market volatility may result in a significantly higher level of transactions and activity which may cause operational challenges that may result in losses these can include but are not limited to trade errors failed transaction settlements late collateral calls to borrowers and counterparties credit losses or interruptions to our system processing periods of reduced revenue and other losses could lead to reduced profitability because certain of our expenses including our interest expense on debt lease expenses and salary expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce them over short time periods is limited our businesses and revenues derived from nonus operations may also be subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations social or political instability less established regulatory regimes changes in governmental or central bank policies downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative economic and political developments we are exposed to credit risk we are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will fail to meet their obligations to us due to numerous causes including bankruptcy lack of liquidity or operational failure among others credit risk may also be affected by the deterioration of strength in the us economy or adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our clients and counterparties we actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our brokerdealers trading and underwriting activities which exposes us to credit risk although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction we still face risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date we also hold certain securities loans and derivatives as part of our trading operations deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans or the nonperformance of counterparties to certain derivatives could result in losses we incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals including through offering sbl ci loans cre loans reit loans residential mortgage loans and taxexempt loans we also incur credit risk through certain of our investments our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities industries or geographies or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to experience credit losses or chargeoffs related to our loans sell loans at unattractive prices or foreclose on certain real estate properties furthermore the deterioration of an individually large exposure for example due to natural disasters health emergencies or pandemics acts of terrorism severe weather events or other adverse economic events could lead to additional credit loss provisions andor chargesoffs and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital in addition tristate capital bank utilizes information provided by thirdparty organizations to monitor changes in the value of marketable securities that serve as collateral for substantially all of its sbl portfolio these third parties also provide control over cash and marketable securities for purposes of perfecting tristate capital banks security interests and retaining the collateral in the applicable accounts in the event that tristate capital bank would need to take control of collateral it is dependent upon such third parties to follow contractual control agreements in order to mitigate any potential losses on its sbl we borrow securities from and lend securities to other financial institutions and may also enter into agreements to repurchase andor resell securities as part of our financing activities a sharp change in the market values of the securities utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitments we manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits as well as by evaluating collateral and transaction levels on a recurring basis significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to widespread concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating our credit risk in addition we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin during periods of steep declines in securities prices the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the loan if clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans we may incur losses on those margin transactions this may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries table end we are exposed to market risk including interest rate risk market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions which directly and indirectly affect us market conditions that change from time to time thereby exposing us to market risk include fluctuations in interest rates equity prices foreign exchange rates and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception actual credit quality of an issuer or other factors market risk is inherent in financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans deposits securities shortterm borrowings longterm debt trading assets and liabilities derivatives and investments for example interest rate increases could adversely affect the value of our availableforsale securities portfolio interest rate changes could also adversely affect the value of our fixed income trading inventories as well as our net interest spread which is the difference between the yield we earn on our interestearning assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding in turn impacting our net interest income and interestrelated earnings interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities market risk may also affect the value of our private equity portfolio which is carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings the value of such investments can fluctuate and the related earnings can be volatile and difficult to predict increases in shortterm interest rates have historically resulted in an increase in our net earnings and we expect decreases in shortterm interest rates to generally reduce our net earnings although there may be offsetting favorable impacts as it relates to our net interest income the magnitude of the effect of a decrease in shortterm interest rates depends on a number of factors impacting balances asset yields and the cost of funding the magnitude of the impact to our net interest margin depends on the yields on interestearning assets relative to the cost of interestbearing liabilities including deposit rates paid to clients on their cash balances decreases in shortterm interest rates generally also result in a decrease to our rjbdp fees earned from thirdparty banks although the magnitude of the impact may also be impacted by demand for cash balances by thirdparty banks and the rate paid to clients on their cash sweep balances rates paid to clients on their cash balances are generally impacted by the level of shortterm interest rates as well as competitive industry dynamics and the demand for client cash additionally any future changes to regulatory rules or interpretations governing the fees the firm earns on cash sweep balances could also impact the rates we pay to clients on cash balances if we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability in addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of security positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increase the level of riskweighted assets on our balance sheet thereby increasing our capital requirements which could have an adverse effect on our business results financial condition and liquidity our ability to attract and retain senior professionals qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our business our ability to recruit serve and retain our clients depends on the reputation judgment leadership business generation capabilities and client service skills of our clientserving professionals members of our executive team as well as employees who support revenuegenerating professionals and their clients to compete effectively we must attract develop and retain qualified professionals including successful financial advisors investment bankers trading professionals portfolio managers and other revenueproducing or specialized support personnel further effective management succession planning including the execution of our succession plans for our current ceo and other senior management positions is important for the continued success of the firm competitive pressures we experience or inadequate management succession planning could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity the labor market remains competitive and we face competition for talent across all aspects of our business as well as competition with nontraditional firms such as technology companies employers are developing a wide variety of offerings to attract talent including but not limited to increasing compensation enhancing health and wellness solutions and providing workplace flexibility these can be important factors in a current associates decision to leave us as well as in a prospective associates decision to join us as competition for skilled professionals remains intense we may have to devote significant resources to attract and retain qualified personnel which could negatively affect earnings specifically within the financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts upfront payments and increased compensation our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel if we were to lose the services of table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries table end any of our financial advisors investment bankers senior equity research analysts sales and trading professionals asset managers or executive officers to a competitor or otherwise we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services if we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals our reputation business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected to the extent we have compensation targets we may not be able to retain our associates which could result in increased recruiting expense result in our recruiting additional associates at compensation levels that are higher than our target range andor negatively impact our revenue growth further new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenues our pcg business is subject to risks arising from an ongoing industrywide trend in which financial advisors are departing traditional firms to form independent rias or to join existing thirdparty rias some of which are backed by private equity investors similarly retiring financial advisors without a successor affiliated with us may sell their practices to unaffiliated third parties such developments reduce the number of our financial advisors and reported aua we seek to mitigate these risks through financial advisor succession planning and by providing our financial advisors with a broad range of services and resources to support their practices we also offer through our rcs division extensive services to thirdparty rias if these mitigation efforts are not successful and the trend of financial advisors transitioning to an unaffiliated ria channel continues or accelerates this could have an adverse effect on our pcg business its results of operations and financial condition moreover companies in our industry whose employees or independent contractors accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices we have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire or otherwise affiliate with qualified personnel some of whom may work for our competitors some of these claims may result in material litigation we could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims regardless of their merits such claims could also discourage potential associates who work for our competitors from joining us we participate with limited exceptions in the protocol for broker recruiting protocol a voluntary agreement among many firms in the industry that governs among other things the client information that financial advisors may take with them when they affiliate with a new firm and the financial advisors ability to solicit clients of their prior firm the ability to bring such client data to a new brokerdealer as well as the ability to solicit clients generally means that the clients of the financial advisor are more likely to choose to open accounts at the advisors new firm participation in the protocol is voluntary and it is possible that certain of our competitors will withdraw from it if the brokerdealers and rias from whom we recruit new financial advisors prevent or significantly limit the transfer of client data and the solicitation of clients our recruiting efforts may be adversely affected additionally we could experience a larger number of claims against us relating to our recruiting efforts our business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products fees earned from the management of client accounts and other asset management fees a large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities and the various services we perform related to such products changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues business and financial condition in addition if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions we may receive lower fees from the distribution and other services we provide on behalf of the mutual fund and annuity companies the asset management fees we are paid are dependent upon the value of client assets in feebased accounts in our pcg segment as well as aum in our asset management segment the value of our feebased assets and aum is impacted by market fluctuations and net inflows or outflows of assets as our pcg clients increasingly show a preference for feebased accounts over transactionbased accounts a larger portion of our client assets are more directly impacted by market movements therefore in periods of declining market values the values of feebased accounts and aum may resultantly decline which would negatively impact our revenues in addition belowmarket investment performance by our funds portfolio managers or financial advisors could result in reputational damage that might cause outflows or make it more difficult to attract new investors into our asset management products and thus further impact our business and financial condition our asset management fees may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition and the renegotiation of contracts additionally most of our clients may withdraw funds from under our management at their discretion at any time for any reason including as a result of competition or poor performance of our products in addition the market environment in recent years has resulted in a shift to passive investment products which generate lower fees than actively managed products a continued trend toward passive investments or changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would negatively affect our revenues business and financial condition table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries table end our underwriting marketmaking trading lending and other business activities place our capital at risk we may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that for any reason we are unable to sell securities we have underwritten at anticipated price levels as an underwriter we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings in which we are involved from time to time as part of our underwriting processes we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry sudden changes in the value of these positions despite our risk mitigation policies could impact our financial results as a market maker we take ownership of positions in specific securities and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified despite risk mitigation policies we may incur losses as a result of positions we hold in connection with these activities a continued interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems or the failure to effectively update the technology we utilize could be materially adverse to our business our businesses rely extensively on data processing and communications systems in addition to better serving clients the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements client needs and competitive demands is critical for our business introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis there are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies adapt our applications to emerging industry standards or keep applications current as it relates to vulnerabilities and security controls our continued success depends in part upon our ability to i successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our technology systems on a regular basis ii maintain the quality of the information contained in our data processing and communications systems iii address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands iv retain skilled information technology employees and v ensure that our existing and new technology systems conform to regulatory requirements failure of our technology systems to operate appropriately which could result from events beyond our control including a systems malfunction or cyberattack failure by a thirdparty service provider or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technologydriven products or services could result in financial losses liability to clients for noncompliant data processing and violations of privacy and other laws and regulations as well as regulatory sanctions the soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects us we face the risk of operational failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents exchanges clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities and derivative transactions as a result of regulatory changes and the consolidation over the years among clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and costeffective alternatives should the need arise any failure termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions service our clients and manage our exposure to risk our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interdependent as a result of trading clearing funding counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients defaults by or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have historically led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us losses arising in connection with counterparty defaults may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations we deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients many of these deposits exceed fdicinsured limits recent events in the financial services industry including the failure of certain banks have increased counterparty credit risk while we perform extensive diligence on the banks we select to hold these deposits a table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries table end failure of one or more of these depository institutions to return these deposits could affect our operating liquidity result in reputational damage and impair our financial performance our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk we seek to manage monitor and control our market credit operational liquidity and legal and regulatory compliance risk through operational and compliance reporting systems internal controls management review processes and other mechanisms however there can be no assurance that our procedures will be effective while we use limits and other risk mitigation techniques those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot always anticipate unforeseen economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes our risk management methods may not predict future risk exposures effectively in addition some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate or may have limited predictive value a failure to manage our growth adequately including growth in the products or services we offer or through acquisitions or to manage our risk effectively could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition financial services firms are subject to numerous actual or perceived conflicts of interest which are routinely examined by regulators and sros such as finra and are often used as the basis for claims for legal liability by plaintiffs in actions against us our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities a perceived or actual failure to address conflicts of interest adequately could affect our reputation the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could result in material harm to our business and financial condition we face intense competition and pricing pressures and may not be able to keep pace with technological change we are engaged in intensely competitive businesses we compete on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of our associates our products and services pricing such as execution pricing and fee levels technology solutions and location and reputation in relevant markets over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors see item business competition of this form 10k for additional information about our competitors we compete directly with other national full service brokerdealers investment banking firms commercial banks and investment advisors investment managers and to a lesser extent with discount brokers and dealers we face competition from more recent entrants into the market including fintechs and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for fintechs to compete with larger financial institutions in providing electronic internetbased and mobile phonebased financial solutions this competition has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to intensify in addition commercial firms and other nontraditional competitors have applied for banking licenses or have entered into partnerships with banks to provide banking services we also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies real estate firms and hedge funds among others competition from other financial services firms to attract clients or trading volume through directtoinvestor online financial services or higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances could result in pricing pressure or otherwise adversely impact our business and cause our business to suffer our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop maintain and enhance our products and services including factors such as customer experience and the pricing and range of our offerings the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services if we are not able to develop new products and services enhance existing offerings effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or successfully market these products and services to our customers our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected furthermore both financial institutions and their nonbanking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies eg ai online trading platforms digital payment technologies that require no intermediation new technologies have required and could require us in the future to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain clients or to match products and services offered by our competitors including technology companies although we currently do not use ai extensively we may in the future use develop and incorporate within our technology platform and services systems and tools that incorporate ai and machine learning including generative ai although we strive to establish and maintain appropriate governance and risk management processes ineffective or inadequate ai development or deployment practices by us or thirdparty vendors could result in unintended consequences such as ai algorithms that produce table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries table end inaccurate output or that are based on biased incomplete andor inaccurate datasets any of the foregoing may result in harm to our business results of operations or reputation compliance with new or changing laws regulations or industry standards relating to ai may impose significant operational costs and limit our ability to develop deploy or use ai and machine learning technologies we must monitor the pricing of our services and financial products in relation to competitors and periodically may need to adjust our fees commissions margins or interest rates on deposits to remain competitive in fixed income markets regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency leading to price competition and decreased trading margins our trading margins have been further compressed by the shift from high to lowtouch services over time which has created additional competitive pressure we believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees commissions or margins a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our operations earnings and financial condition if our credit ratings were downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged and as a result adversely affect our client relationships such a change in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position increase our borrowing costs limit our access to the capital and credit markets trigger obligations under certain financial agreements cause clients to withdraw bank deposits that exceed fdic insurance limits from our bank subsidiaries or decrease the number of investors clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability we may not be able to obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms or at all the impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in certain of our derivative instruments and may result in a request for immediate payment andor ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions a credit rating downgrade would also result in the firm incurring a higher facility fee on its million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement the credit facility in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on the line as of and subsequent to such downgrade see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources of this form 10k and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for information on the credit facility business growth including through acquisitions could increase costs and regulatory and integration risks we continue to grow including through acquisitions and through our recruiting efforts integrating acquired businesses providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges while cultural fit is a requirement for both our recruiting and acquisition efforts there can be no assurance that recruited talent andor acquisition targets will ultimately assimilate into our firm in a manner which results in the expected financial benefits we may incur significant expense including in the areas of technology and cybersecurity in connection with expanding our existing businesses recruiting financial advisors or when acquiring and integrating businesses our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the earnings derived from such investments or growth assumptions which underlie the basis of our acquisition decisions such as the retention of key personnel future revenue growth of an acquired business cost efficiencies to be realized or the value created through the application of specialized expertise we plan to bring to the acquired business may not be fully realized postacquisition resulting in an adverse impact on the value of our investment and potential dilution of the value of our shares we may be unable to integrate an acquired business into our existing business successfully or such integration may be materially delayed or become more costly or difficult than expected further either companys clients suppliers employees or other business partners may react negatively to the transaction such developments could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations domestic and international business growth including through acquisitions may expose us to additional regulatory oversight create a need for additional compliance risk management and internal control procedures and require us to hire additional personnel to address these procedures to the extent such procedures are not adequate or not adhered to with respect to our expanded business or any new business we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries table end moreover to the extent we pursue acquisitions or enter into acquisition commitments a number of factors may prevent us from completing such acquisitions on acceptable terms for example regulators such as the fed could fail to approve a proposed transaction or such approvals could result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the transaction the shareholders of a publiclytraded target company could fail to approve the transaction closing conditions in the transaction agreement could fail to be satisfied or there could be an unexpected delay in closing other developments that may affect future results of an acquired company may occur including changes in asset quality and credit risk changes in interest rates and capital markets inflation andor changes in customer borrowing repayment investment and deposit practices finally an event change or other circumstance could occur that gives rise to the termination of the transaction agreement in addition we may need to raise capital or borrow funds in order to finance an acquisition which could result in dilution or increased leverage we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms or perhaps at all further we may issue our shares as a component of some or all of the purchase consideration for an acquisition which may result in dilution securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements even if such lawsuits are without merit defending against these claims could result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources an adverse judgment could result in monetary damages which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition associate misconduct which is difficult to detect and deter could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harm there is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business for example our investment banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients our associates interact with clients customers and counterparties on an ongoing basis all associates are expected to exhibit the behaviors and ethics that are reflected in our framework of principles policies and technology to protect both our own information as well as that of our clients if our associates improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients we could be subject to future regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation financial position current client relationships and ability to attract future clients we are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over our assets under management in addition our financial advisors are required to act in the best interests of our clients and may act in a fiduciary capacity providing financial planning investment advice and discretionary asset management the violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us associate conduct on nonbusiness matters such as social issues including the posting of information on social media or other internet forums could be inconsistent with our policies and ethics and result in reputational harm to our business due to their employment by us or affiliation with us it is not always possible to deter or prevent every instance of associate misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases if our associates engage in misconduct our business would be adversely affected we are subject to risks relating to environmental social and governance matters that could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations as well as the price of our common and preferred stock we are subject to a variety of risks including reputational risk associated with environmental social and governance matters as a large financial institution we have multiple stakeholders including our shareholders clients associates federal and state regulatory authorities and the communities in which we operate and these stakeholders will often have differing priorities and expectations regarding such matters for example individual us states are increasingly developing differing and sometimes conflicting rules related to environmental social and governance matters if we take action in conflict with one or another of those stakeholders expectations we could experience an increase in client complaints a loss of business or reputational harm we could also face negative publicity or reputational harm based on the identity of those with whom we choose to do business any adverse publicity in connection with environmental social and governance issues could damage our reputation ability to attract and retain clients and associates compete effectively and grow our business in addition proxy advisory firms and certain institutional investors who manage investments in public companies may integrate environmental social and governance factors into their investment analysis the consideration of environmental and social matters in making investment and voting decisions is relatively new accordingly the frameworks and methods for assessing policies related to such matters are not fully developed vary considerably among the investment community and will likely continue to evolve over time moreover the subjective nature of methods used by various stakeholders to assess a company with respect to environmental social and governance criteria could result in erroneous perceptions or a misrepresentation of our actual policies and practices in these areas organizations that provide ratings information to investors on such matters may table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries table end also assign unfavorable ratings to rjf public companies continue to face pressure from stakeholders to consider environmental social and governance issues in corporate actions such as the election of directors and approval of executive compensation certain of our clients might also require that we implement additional procedures or standards in these areas in order to continue to do business with them if we fail to comply with specific investor or client expectations and standards or to provide the disclosure relating to these issues that any third parties may believe is necessary or appropriate regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so our reputation business financial condition andor results of operations could be negatively impacted moreover there has been increased regulatory focus on the disclosure practices of investment managers offering sustainable and valuesbased investment strategies resulting in increased risk that we could be perceived as making inaccurate or misleading statements regarding the investment strategies of our funds and etfs commonly referred to as greenwashing such perceptions or accusations could damage our reputation result in litigation or regulatory enforcement actions and adversely affect our business the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain one of our most critical estimates is our allowance for credit losses at any given point in time conditions in real estate and credit markets may increase the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in our loan portfolio the recorded amount of liabilities related to legal and regulatory matters is also subject to significant management judgement for either of these estimates if managements underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate our loss provisions could be insufficient to cover actual losses and our financial condition including our liquidity and capital and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted for additional discussion of our significant accounting estimates policies and standards see item managements discussion and

significant operations to be conducted out of remote locations as well as our southfield michigan and memphis tennessee corporate offices and our us information systems processing to be conducted out of our information technology data center in the denver colorado area our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions the magnitude and frequency of which may be affected by climate change such weather conditions could affect the processing of transactions communications and the ability of our associates to get to our offices or work remotely in addition our operations are dependent on our associates ability to relocate to a secondary location in the event of a power outage or other disruption in their primary remote work location furthermore such weather events may also have a negative impact on the operations andor financial condition of our clients or counterparties which may affect the processing of transactions with such parties decrease revenues from such clients or increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to such clients we are exposed to risks related to our insurance programs our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance selfinsured retention and selfinsurance for a number of risks to a large extent we have elected to selfinsure our errors and omissions liability and our employeerelated health care benefit plans we have selfinsured retention risk related to several exposures including our property and casualty workers compensation and professional liability policies while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage appropriate to our risk assessment we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages our business may be negatively affected if our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable in addition
