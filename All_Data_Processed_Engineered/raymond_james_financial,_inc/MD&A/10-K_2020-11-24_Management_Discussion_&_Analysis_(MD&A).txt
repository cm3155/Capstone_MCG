financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition this mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements where nm is used in various percentage change computations the computed percentage change has been determined to be not meaningful we operate as a financial holding company and bank holding company results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets changes in interest rates market volatility corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends overall market conditions economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants including investors borrowers and competitors impacting their level of participation in the financial markets these factors also impact the level of investment banking activity and asset valuations which ultimately affect our business results executive overview year ended september compared with the year ended september net revenues of billion for our fiscal year ended september increased million or pretax income of billion decreased million or and our net income of million decreased million or our earnings per diluted share were reflecting a decrease our return on equity roe was compared with for the prior year and return on tangible common equity rotce was compared with for the prior year our financial results were significantly impacted by the direct and indirect impacts of the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic and related governmentimposed and other measures intended to control the spread of the disease including restrictions on travel and the conduct of business such as stayathome orders quarantines travel bans border closings business closures and other similar measures had a significant impact on global economic conditions and the environment in which we operated during our fiscal year in response to the pandemic in march we activated certain aspects of our business continuity plans endeavoring to protect our associates and our clients as a result nearly all of our associates transitioned to working remotely while still maintaining our high standards of client service although economies began to reopen during the latter portion of our fiscal third quarter and continued to progress during our fourth quarter a substantial portion of our associates continued to work remotely through the end of our fiscal year the covid19 pandemic had varied impacts across our businesses while certain of our businesses benefited from increased volatility and higher levels of client activity caused by the pandemic our results were significantly and negatively affected by the significant reduction in interest rates implemented by the federal reserve in march the economic impact and uncertainty attributable to the pandemic also resulted in factors that contributed to an elevated bank loan loss provision uncertainty carries over into our fiscal year with regard to the extent and duration of the disruptions related to the pandemic as well as its continuing impacts on the global economy the extent of such effects will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain as a result of the economic environment in september we announced a reduction in workforce and as a result recognized million of related expenses in our fiscal fourth quarter of excluding these expenses and a million loss related to the pending disposition of our interests in certain entities in our capital markets segment that operate predominately in france adjusted net income was million a decrease of compared with adjusted net income of billion for the prior year the prior year included a million goodwill impairment charge associated with our canadian capital markets business and a million loss on the sale of our operations related to research sales and trading of european equities which did not recur in fiscal year adjusted earnings per diluted share were a decrease compared with adjusted earnings per diluted share of for the prior year our adjusted roe was compared with for the prior year and adjusted rotce was compared with for the prior year rotce adjusted net income adjusted earnings per diluted share adjusted roe and adjusted rotce are each nongaap financial measures please see the reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap financial measures in this mda for a reconciliation of our nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures and for other important disclosures raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis a million increase in net revenues compared with the prior year was driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees primarily attributable to higher pcg assets in feebased accounts as well as strong fixed income brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues offsetting these increases were the negative impacts of lower shortterm interest rates on our net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks and valuation losses on private equity investments a portion of which was attributable to noncontrolling interests reflected as an offset in other expenses compensation commissions and benefits expense increased million or mostly due to an increase in revenues which primarily include asset management and related administrative fees brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues certain of our revenue streams such as net interest income do not have a direct associated payout therefore changes in these revenue streams do not directly impact our compensationrelated expenses but do affect our ratio of compensation commissions and benefits expense to net revenues compensation ratio our compensation ratio increased to compared with for the prior year primarily due to the negative impact of lower interest rates on revenue streams that are not directly compensable such as net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks noncompensation expenses increased million or due to a million increase in the bank loan loss provision which was million in the current year compared with million in the prior year and the aforementioned million of reduction in workforce expenses these increases were partially offset by a significant decline in business development expenses due to lower travel and conferencerelated expenses during the second half of the fiscal year as a result of the covid19 pandemic our effective income tax rate was for fiscal a decrease compared with the effective tax rate for fiscal year primarily due to nontaxable gains on our corporateowned life insurance portfolio we ended fiscal with capital ratios well in excess of regulatory requirements and substantial liquidity with over billion of cash at the parent company which included the proceeds of a million 10year senior notes issuance at the end of our fiscal second quarter of pursuant to our board of directors share repurchase authorization we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock during fiscal year for million at an average price of approximately per share due to heightened market uncertainty as a result of the covid19 pandemic share repurchases were suspended from midmarch through our fiscal third quarter but were resumed in our fiscal fourth quarter to offset dilution related to our sharebased compensation we expect to continue share repurchases in fiscal to offset dilution and may make additional share repurchases as appropriate as of september we had million of availability remaining under the previouslyannounced authorization certain of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic are likely to continue to affect our results in fiscal our net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks will likely reflect the fullyear impact of the basis point reduction by the federal reserve of its benchmark shortterm interest rate in march as we do not anticipate shortterm interest rates to recover to the beginning of the fiscal year level during fiscal in capital markets market uncertainty during the pandemic may result in volatility of both brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues while our results during fiscal were negatively impacted by elevated bank loan loss provisions including losses on certain corporate loans that were sold during the year further market deterioration could result in additional provisions in fiscal the timing and amount of the business development expenses we will incur in fiscal will be heavily influenced by the progression of the covid19 pandemic we continue to pursue opportunities to reduce costs and invest in and implement efficiencies in our processes to remain wellpositioned for future growth and success a summary of our financial results by segment compared to the prior year is as follows pcg segment net revenues of billion increased while pretax income of million decreased the million increase in net revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in asset management and related administrative fees due to higher average assets in feebased accounts partially offset by decreases in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks and net interest income due to lower shortterm interest rates noninterest expenses increased million or primarily resulting from an increase in compensation expenses largely due to the growth in compensable net revenues primarily asset management and related administrative fees for additional information please see the liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity section in this mda raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis capital markets net revenues of billion increased and pretax income of million increased the million increase in net revenues was primarily due to an increase in fixed income brokerage revenues due to higher client activity as well as increases in equity and debt underwriting revenues these increases were partially offset by a decline in merger acquisition revenues noninterest expenses increased million or due to higher compensation expenses primarily attributable to the increase in revenues asset management segment net revenues of million increased and pretax income of million increased the increase in net revenues was driven by higher assets in feebased programs offered to pcg clients and market appreciation which offset net outflows at carillon town advisers rj bank net revenues of million decreased and pretax income of million decreased the million decrease in net revenues reflected the negative impact of lower shortterm interest rates which more than offset the growth in interestearning assets noninterest expenses increased million or primarily due to a million increase in the loan loss provision our other segment reflected a pretax loss that was million larger compared to the prior year primarily due to the aforementioned million in reduction in workforce expenses private equity valuation losses as compared to gains in the prior year lower interest income on corporate cash balances due to lower shortterm interest rates and increased interest expense due to the issuance of million of senior notes at the end of the fiscal second quarter year ended september compared with the year ended september refer to item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our sandreports within other reports and information should markets suddenly become more volatile as they did in our fiscal second quarter of actual trading losses may exceed var results presented on a single day and might accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of consecutive trading days accordingly management applies additional controls including position limits a daily review of trading results review of the status of aged inventory independent controls on pricing monitoring of concentration risk review of issuer ratings and stress testing we utilize stress testing to complement our var analysis so as to measure risk under historical and hypothetical adverse scenarios during volatile markets we may choose to pare our trading inventories to reduce risk as we did during our fiscal second quarter of banking operations rj bank maintains an interestearning asset portfolio that is comprised of cash ci loans taxexempt loans commercial and residential real estate loans sbl and other loans as well as agency mbs and agency cmos held in the availableforsale securities portfolio sba loan securitizations and a trading portfolio of corporate loans these interestearning assets are primarily funded by client deposits based on its current asset portfolio rj bank is subject to interest rate risk rj bank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid and the net portfolio valuation both across a range of interest rate scenarios one of the objectives of rj banks asset liability management committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit rj banks interest rate risk including scenario analysis and economic value of equity rj bank uses simulation models and estimation techniques to assess the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates to ensure that rj bank remains within its tolerances established for net interest income a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated under a variety of scenarios the model estimates the sensitivity by calculating interest income and interest expense in a dynamic balance sheet environment using current repricing prepayment and reinvestment of cash flow assumptions over a twelve month time horizon various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income scenarios presented include instantaneous interest rate shocks of up and basis points and down basis points while not presented additional rate scenarios are performed including interest rate ramps and yield curve shifts that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements rj bank also performs simulations on time horizons of up to five years to assess longer term impacts to various interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis rj bank tests expected model results to actual performance additionally any changes made to key assumptions in the model are documented and approved by rj banks asset liability management committee we utilize a hedging strategy using interest rate swaps as a result of rj banks asset and liability management process previously described for further information regarding this hedging strategy see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k the following table is an analysis of rj banks estimated net interest income over a 12month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates expressed in basis points using rj banks own assetliability model

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk as a result of our capital markets activities our brokerdealer activities are generally clientdriven and we carry equity securities as part of our trading inventory to facilitate such activities although the amounts are not as significant as our fixed income trading inventory we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions throughout each day and establishing position limits equity securities held in our trading inventory are generally included in var in addition we have a private equity portfolio included in other investments on our consolidated statements of financial condition which is comprised of various direct investments as well as investments in thirdparty private equity funds and various legacy private equity funds which we sponsor of the total private equity investments at september of raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis million the portion we owned was million see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information on this portfolio foreign exchange risk we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the us dollar for example a portion of our bank loan portfolio includes loans which are denominated in canadian dollars totaling billion and billion at september and respectively when converted to the us dollar a portion of such loans are held by rj banks canadian subsidiary which is discussed in the following sections investments in foreign subsidiaries rj bank has an investment in a canadian subsidiary resulting in foreign exchange risk to mitigate its foreign exchange risk rj bank utilizes shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts these derivatives are primarily accounted for as net investment hedges in the consolidated financial statements see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information regarding these derivatives we had foreign exchange risk in our investment in rj ltd of cad million at september which was not hedged foreign exchange gainslosses related to this investment are primarily reflected in oci on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information regarding our components of oci we also have foreign exchange risk associated with our investments in subsidiaries located in europe these investments are not hedged and we do not believe we have material foreign exchange risk either individually or in the aggregate pertaining to these subsidiaries transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the us dollar we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our holdings of cash and certain other assets and liabilities resulting from transactions denominated in a currency other than the us dollar any currencyrelated gainslosses arising from these foreign currency denominated balances are reflected in other revenues in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of such transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency are mitigated utilizing shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts such derivatives are not designated hedges and therefore the related gainslosses associated with these contracts are included in other revenues in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for information regarding our derivatives credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrowers issuers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreedupon terms the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction the structure and duration of that transaction and the parties involved credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities we are exposed to credit risk through our brokerage activities as well as our lending activities primarily in rj bank the decline in economic activity as a result of covid19 has caused increased credit risk in general and particularly with regard to companies in sectors that have been most significantly impacted by the economic disruption including energy airlines entertainment and leisure restaurants and gaming given the stresses on certain of our clients liquidity we have enhanced our credit monitoring activities with an increased focus on monitoring our credit exposures and counterparty credit risk since the onset of the pandemic rj bank has enacted risk mitigation strategies including but not limited to the sale of loans in those sectors with a high likelihood of adverse impact arising from the pandemic we have also required collateral to be posted across our credit risk exposures in accordance with agreements with our borrowers and counterparties we are subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions extend large loans to or have large commitments with a single counterparty borrower or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry repurchase agreements consist primarily of securities issued by the us government or its agencies receivables from and payables to clients and securities borrowing and lending activities are conducted with a large number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully monitored inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made including raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis underwritings may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses we seek to mitigate this risk through careful review of the underlying business and the use of limits established by senior management taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the counterparty the size of the position or commitment the expected duration of the position or commitment and other positions or commitments outstanding brokerage activities we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which our counterparties primarily include brokerdealers banks and other financial institutions we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty andor the issuer of the instrument we manage this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties reviewing security and loan concentrations holding and calculating the fair value of collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations which may guarantee performance our client activities involve the execution settlement and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis credit exposure results from client margin loans which are monitored daily and are collateralized by the securities in the clients accounts we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analysis on a daily basis in connection with our margin lending activities we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions in addition when clients execute a purchase we are at some risk that the client will default on their financial obligation associated with the trade if this occurs we may have to liquidate the position at a loss we offer loans to financial advisors and certain other key revenue producers primarily for recruiting transitional cost assistance and retention purposes we have credit risk and may incur a loss primarily in the event that such borrower is no longer affiliated with us banking activities rj bank has a substantial loan portfolio while rj banks loan portfolio is diversified a significant downturn in the overall economy such as that experienced in fiscal as a result of the covid19 pandemic deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where rj bank has a concentration will generally result in large provisions for loan losses andor chargeoffs rj bank determines the allowance that is required for specific loan grades based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis rj bank evaluates its methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and makes enhancements it considers appropriate rj banks strategy for credit risk management includes welldefined credit policies uniform underwriting criteria and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all corporate taxexempt residential sbl and other credit exposures the strategy also includes diversification on a geographic industry and customer level regular credit examinations and management reviews of all corporate and taxexempt loans as well as individual delinquent residential loans the credit risk management process also includes an annual independent review of the credit risk monitoring process that performs assessments of compliance with credit policies risk ratings and other critical credit information rj bank seeks to identify potential problem loans early record any necessary risk rating changes and chargeoffs promptly and maintain appropriate reserve levels for probable inherent losses rj bank utilizes a comprehensive credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and taxexempt loans and related unfunded lending commitments including the probability of default andor loss given default of each corporate and taxexempt loan and commitment outstanding for its sbl and residential mortgage loans rj bank utilizes the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loans rj banks allowance for loan losses methodology is described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k as rj banks loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments likewise the allowance for loan losses is segregated by these same segments the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows ci loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by all assets of the business repayment is expected from the cash flows of the respective business unfavorable economic and political conditions including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment cre loans in this segment are primarily secured by incomeproducing properties for owneroccupied properties the cash flows are derived from the operations of the business and the underlying cash flows may be adversely affected by the raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business the underlying cash flows generated by nonowneroccupied properties may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and rental rates which are monitored on a quarterly basis adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment cre construction loans in this segment have similar risk characteristics of loans in the cre segment as previously described in addition project budget overruns and performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors may affect the credit quality of loans in this segment with respect to commercial construction of residential developments there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments adverse developments in all of these areas may significantly affect the credit quality of the loans in this segment taxexempt loans in this segment are made to governmental and nonprofit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and in some cases by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed for loans to governmental entities repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes for nonprofit entities repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds these loans are subject to demographic risk therefore much of the credit assessment of taxexempt loans is driven by the entitys revenue base and general economic environment adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment residential mortgage includes home equity loanslines all of rj banks residential mortgage loans adhere to stringent underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history debttoincome ratio of borrower loantovalue ltv and combined ltv including second mortgagehome equity loans rj bank does not originate or purchase option adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with negative amortization reverse mortgages or loans to subprime borrowers loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are not originated or purchased all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower a decline in the strength of the economy particularly unemployment rates and housing prices among other factors could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment sbl and other loans in this segment are collateralized generally by the borrowers marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards these loans are monitored daily for adherence to ltv guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required ltv a collateral call is issued past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of the collateral which will bring the loan to a current status in evaluating credit risk rj bank considers trends in loan performance the level of allowance coverage relative to similar banking institutions industry or customer concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net chargeoffs however during fiscal year corporate borrowers have continued to access the markets for new equity and debt several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the allowance for loan losses at september including the risk profile of the portfolios net chargeoffs during the period the level of nonperforming loans delinquency ratios and the impact of the covid19 pandemic rj bank also considered the uncertainty related to certain industry sectors and the extent of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio finally rj bank considered current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio in response to the covid19 pandemic we performed a portfoliowide assessment of our loan portfolio as a result we downgraded loans in certain impacted industries which gave rise to elevated loan loss provisions during fiscal in addition we sold approximately million before chargeoffs and discounts or premiums of corporate loans during the fiscal year in industries that we believe to be most vulnerable to the covid19 pandemic we will continue to assess the impact of covid19 and as more information becomes available regarding the financial repercussions to our borrowers the risk ratings for individual loans will be updated and the allowance will be adjusted accordingly raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis the following table presents rj banks changes in the allowance for loan losses table start year ended september in millions allowance for loan losses

assets an increase in our allowance for loan losses andor an increase in net chargeoffs in future periods although the extent will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain we have received requests from certain borrowers for forbearance or deferral of their loan payments to us driven or exacerbated by the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic certain borrowers have also requested modifications of covenant terms in accordance with the cares act we have elected to not apply tdr classification to any covid19 related loan modifications that were performed after march to borrowers who were current as of december based on the outstanding principal balance as of the end of september we have active shortterm payment deferrals on approximately million and million of our corporate and residential loans respectively such deferrals could delay the recognition of net chargeoffs delinquencies and nonaccrual status for those borrowers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis loan underwriting policies a component of rj banks credit risk management strategy is conservative welldefined policies and procedures rj banks underwriting policies for the major types of loans are described in the following sections residential mortgage and sbl and other loan portfolios rj banks residential mortgage loan portfolio consists of first mortgage loans originated by rj bank via referrals from our pcg financial advisors and the general public as well as first mortgage loans purchased by rj bank all of rj banks residential mortgage loans adhere to strict underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history debttoincome ratio of the borrower ltv and combined ltv including second mortgagehome equity loans as of september approximately of the residential loans were fully documented loans to industry standards and of the residential mortgage loan portfolio consisted of owneroccupant borrowers for their primary residences and for second home residences approximately of the first lien residential mortgage loans were arm loans which receive interestonly payments based on a fixed rate for an initial period of the loan and then become fully amortizing subject to annual and lifetime interest rate caps a significant portion of our originated or 30year fixedrate mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market rj banks sbl and other portfolio is comprised primarily of loans fully collateralized by clients marketable securities and represented of rj banks total loan portfolio as of september the underwriting policy for the sbl and other portfolio primarily includes a review of collateral including ltv with a limited review of repayment history while rj bank has chosen not to participate in any governmentsponsored loan modification programs its loan modification policy does take into consideration some of the programs parameters and supports every effort to assist borrowers within the guidelines of safety and soundness in general rj bank considers the qualification terms outlined in the governmentsponsored programs as well as the affordability test and other factors rj bank retains flexibility to determine the appropriate modification structure and required documentation to support the borrowers current financial situation before approving a modification short sales are also used by rj bank to mitigate credit losses corporate and taxexempt loan portfolios rj banks corporate and taxexempt loan portfolios were comprised of approximately borrowers the majority of which are underwritten managed and reviewed at our corporate headquarters location which facilitates close monitoring of the portfolio by credit risk personnel relationship officers and senior rj bank executives rj banks corporate loan portfolio is diversified among a number of industries in both the us and canada and is comprised of project finance real estate loans commercial lines of credit and term loans the majority of which are participations in shared national credit snc or other large syndicated loans and taxexempt loans rj bank is sometimes involved in the syndication of the loan at inception and some of these loans have been purchased in the secondary trading markets the remainder of the corporate loan portfolio is comprised of smaller participations and direct loans there are no subordinated loans or mezzanine financings in the corporate loan portfolio rj banks taxexempt loans are longterm loans to governmental and nonprofit entities these loans generally have lower overall credit risk but are subject to other risks that are not usually present with corporate clients including the risk associated with the constituency served by a local government and the risk in ensuring an obligation has appropriate tax treatment regardless of the source all corporate and taxexempt loans are independently underwritten to rj bank credit policies and are subject to approval by a loan committee and credit quality is monitored on an ongoing basis by rj banks lending staff rj bank credit policies include criteria related to ltv limits based upon property type single borrower loan limits loan term and structure parameters including guidance on leverage debt service coverage ratios and debt repayment ability industry concentration limits secondary sources of repayment municipality demographics and other criteria a large portion of rj banks corporate loans are to borrowers in industries in which we have expertise through coverage provided by our capital markets research analysts more than half of rj banks corporate borrowers are public companies rj banks corporate loans are generally secured by all assets of the borrower in some instances are secured by mortgages on specific real estate and with respect to taxexempt loans are generally secured by a pledge of revenue in a limited number of transactions loans in the portfolio are extended on an unsecured basis in addition all corporate and taxexempt loans are subject to rj banks regulatory review raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis risk monitoring process another component of the credit risk strategy at rj bank is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all residential sbl corporate and taxexempt credit exposures as well as our rigorous processes to manage and limit credit losses arising from loan delinquencies there are various other factors included in these processes depending on the loan portfolio residential mortgage and sbl and other loan portfolios the collateral securing rj banks sbl and other portfolio is monitored on a recurring basis with marketable collateral monitored on a daily basis collateral adjustments are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure rj banks loans are adequately secured resulting in minimizing its credit risk collateral calls have been minimal relative to our sbl and other portfolio with no losses incurred to date we track and review many factors to monitor credit risk in rj banks residential mortgage loan portfolio the factors include but are not limited to loan performance trends loan product parameters and qualification requirements borrower credit scores level of documentation loan purpose geographic concentrations average loan size and ltv ratios these measures while considered and reviewed in establishing the allowance for loan losses have not resulted in any material adjustments to rj banks historical loss rates the following table presents a summary of delinquent residential mortgage loans the vast majority of which are first mortgage loans which are comprised of loans which are two or more payments past due as well as loans in the process of foreclosure amounts in the following table do not include residential loans to borrowers who have been granted forbearance as a result of the covid19 pandemic and whose loans were not considered delinquent prior to the forbearance such loans may be considered delinquent after the forbearance period depending on their payment status as a result the amount of residential loans considered delinquent may increase significantly in fiscal as the forbearance periods expire table start amount of delinquent residential loans delinquent residential loans as a percentage of outstanding loan balances in millions days days or more total days days or more total september september table end our september
