help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition this mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements where nm is used in various percentage change computations the computed percentage change has been determined to be not meaningful we operate as a financial holding company and bank holding company results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets changes in interest rates market volatility corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends overall market conditions economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants including investors borrowers and competitors impacting their level of participation in the financial markets these factors also impact the level of investment banking activity and asset valuations which ultimately affect our business results executive overview year ended september compared with the year ended september we generated strong results for fiscal with net revenues of billion an increase of compared with the prior year and pretax income of billion an increase of during fiscal pretax margin increased in all of our operating segments and we generated particularly strong results in our pcg capital markets and asset management segments our net income of billion was higher than the prior year and our earnings per diluted share of which reflected the impact of a 3for2 stock split in september increased our return on equity roe was compared with for the prior year and return on tangible common equity rotce was compared with for the prior year during fiscal we completed a million 30year senior notes offering at utilizing the proceeds from the offering and cash on hand to earlyredeem our million of senior notes due and our million of senior notes due we recognized losses on the extinguishment of such notes of million excluding these losses and acquisitionrelated expenses of million our adjusted net income was billion an increase of compared with adjusted net income for the prior year adjusted earnings per diluted share were a increase compared with adjusted earnings per diluted share of for the prior year our adjusted roe was compared with for the prior year and adjusted rotce was compared with for the prior year the significant increase in net revenues compared with the prior year was driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees largely attributable to higher pcg assets in feebased accounts as well as strong investment banking revenues and brokerage revenues revenues in the current year also included million of private equity valuation gains of which million were attributable to noncontrolling interests and were offset in other expenses compared with million of losses in the prior year of which million were attributable to noncontrolling interests offsetting these increases was the negative impact of lower shortterm interest rates on our net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks compensation commissions and benefits expense increased billion or primarily resulting from the growth in revenues and pretax income compared with the prior year our compensation ratio or the ratio of compensation commissions and benefits expense to net revenues decreased to compared with for the prior year the decrease in our compensation ratio primarily resulted from higher revenues and changes in our revenue mix due to strong net revenues in our capital markets segment which had a lower compensation ratio at than our pcg segment and the private equity valuation gains which have no associated direct compensation our compensation ratio also benefited from expense management initiatives during our fiscal fourth quarter of the board of directors approved a 3for2 stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on september all share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect this stock split rotce adjusted

measures in this mda for a reconciliation of our nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures and for other important disclosures raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis noncompensation expenses decreased million or primarily due to a million decrease in the bank loan provision for credit losses which was a benefit of million in the current year computed under the current expected credit loss cecl methodology compared with a provision of million in the prior year computed under the incurred loss methodology noncompensation expenses also decreased as a result of million of expenses in the prior year related to a reduction in workforce which did not recur in the current year as well as a decrease in business development expenses due to lower travel and eventrelated expenses as a result of the covid19 pandemic these decreases were partially offset by the aforementioned losses on extinguishment of debt of million in the current year and an increase in other expenses primarily due to the change in private equity valuations attributable to noncontrolling interests compared with the prior year our effective income tax rate was for fiscal a decrease compared with the effective tax rate for fiscal primarily due to an increase in nontaxable gains on our corporateowned life insurance portfolio liquidity and capital remained strong as of september our total capital ratio of and tier leverage ratio of were each more than double the regulatory requirements to be considered wellcapitalized we also continued to have substantial liquidity with billion of cash at the parent company which includes parent cash loaned to rja we expect to continue to be opportunistic in deploying our capital in fiscal through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions as evidenced by our fiscal acquisitions of nwps holdings inc financo llc and cebile capital and the announced acquisitions of charles stanley group plc and tristate capital holdings inc which we expect to close in fiscal pursuant to our board of directors share repurchase authorization we repurchased million  of common stock during fiscal for million leaving million of availability remaining under the authorization as of september however due to regulatory restrictions following our announced acquisition of tristate capital holdings we do not expect to repurchase shares until after closing we remain wellpositioned entering fiscal with nearly trillion of client assets under administration strong activity levels for financial advisory recruiting and a strong investment banking pipeline however we expect to continue to face headwinds from nearzero shortterm interest rates and economic uncertainty including that arising from inflation supply chain complications and uncertainty around us economic policy in addition although the economy has improved since the beginning of the covid19 pandemic the pace of recovery in the future is uncertain due to concerns related to the pandemic including the spread of the delta variant and other variants vaccine distribution and vaccine rates as a result we may experience volatility in brokerage and investment banking revenues which may negatively impact our ability to sustain the level of revenues in future periods which were achieved in fiscal although our results during the year were positively impacted by a benefit for credit losses related to our bank loan portfolio net loan growth andor future market deterioration could result in increased provisions in future periods in addition we expect that expenses will continue to increase in fiscal as business and eventrelated travel increase and as we continue to make investments in our people and technology to support our growth year ended september compared with the year ended september refer to item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our sandreports within other

are primarily funded by client deposits based on its current asset portfolio raymond james bank is subject to interest rate risk raymond james bank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid and the net portfolio valuation both across a range of interest rate scenarios one of the objectives of raymond james banks asset and liability committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit raymond james banks interest rate risk including scenario analysis and economic value of equity to ensure that raymond james bank remains within its tolerances established for net interest income a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated under a variety of scenarios we use simulation models and raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis estimation techniques to assess the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates the model estimates the sensitivity by calculating interest income and interest expense in a dynamic balance sheet environment using current repricing prepayment and reinvestment of cash flow assumptions over a 12month time horizon assumptions used in the model include interest rate movement the slope of the yield curve and balance sheet composition and growth the model also considers interest raterelated risks such as pricing spreads pricing of client cash accounts and prepayments various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income the following table is an analysis of raymond james banks estimated net interest income over a 12month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates expressed in basis points using our assetliability model which assumes that interest rates do not decline below zero while not presented additional rate scenarios are performed including interest rate ramps and yield curve shifts that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements we also perform simulations on time horizons of up to five years to assess longerterm impacts to various interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis we test expected model results to actual performance additionally any changes made to key assumptions in the model are documented and approved by raymond james banks asset and liability committee table start instantaneous changes in

clientdriven and we carry equity securities as part of our trading inventory to facilitate such activities although the amounts are not as significant as our fixed income trading inventory we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions each day and establishing position limits equity securities held in our trading inventory are generally included in var in addition we have a private equity portfolio included in other investments on our consolidated statements of financial condition which is comprised of various direct investments as well as investments in thirdparty private equity funds and various legacy private equity funds which we sponsor of the total private equity investments at september of million the portion we owned was million see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information on this portfolio foreign exchange risk we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the us dollar for example our bank loan portfolio includes loans which are denominated in canadian dollars totaling billion and billion at september and respectively when converted to the us dollar a majority of such loans are held by raymond james banks canadian subsidiary which is discussed in the following sections investments in foreign subsidiaries raymond james bank has an investment in a canadian subsidiary resulting in foreign exchange risk to mitigate its foreign exchange risk raymond james bank utilizes shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts these derivatives are primarily accounted for as net investment hedges in the consolidated financial statements see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information regarding these derivatives we had foreign exchange risk in our investment in rj ltd of cad million at september which was not hedged foreign exchange gainslosses related to this investment are primarily reflected in oci on our consolidated statements of raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis income and comprehensive income see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information regarding our components of oci we also have foreign exchange risk associated with our investments in subsidiaries located in europe these investments are not hedged and we do not believe we had material foreign exchange risk either individually or in the aggregate pertaining to these subsidiaries as of september as previously noted on july we announced our intention to make an offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of ukbased charles stanley at a price of per share or approximately million prior to closing we will use us dollars to purchase the required british pounds sterling gbp to be used at closing upon closing this transaction will increase our foreign exchange exposure associated with investments in subsidiaries located in europe transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the us dollar we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our holdings of cash and certain other assets and liabilities resulting from transactions denominated in a currency other than the us dollar any currencyrelated gainslosses arising from these foreign currency denominated balances are reflected in other revenues in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of such transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency are mitigated utilizing shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts such derivatives are not designated hedges and therefore the related gainslosses are included in other revenues in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for information regarding our derivatives credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrowers issuers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreedupon terms the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction the structure and duration of that transaction and the parties involved credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities the initial decline in economic activity as a result of the covid19 pandemic caused increased credit risk particularly with regard to companies in sectors that were most significantly impacted by the economic disruption the speed and magnitude in which various sectors have recovered since the onset of the pandemic has been continually evolving given the stresses on certain of our clients liquidity we enhanced our credit monitoring activities with an increased focus on monitoring our credit exposures and counterparty credit risk in addition since the onset of the covid19 pandemic raymond james bank has enacted risk mitigation strategies including but not limited to the sale of loans in those sectors with a high likelihood of adverse impact arising from the pandemic although economic conditions have generally improved we have maintained our increased focus on monitoring our credit exposures and counterparty credit risk brokerage activities we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which our counterparties primarily include brokerdealers banks and other financial institutions we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations in addition certain commitments including underwritings may create exposure to individual issuers and businesses the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty andor the issuer of the instrument in addition we may be subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions in or have large commitments to a single counterparty borrower or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry we seek to mitigate these risks by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties reviewing security and loan concentrations holding and calculating the fair value of collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations which may guarantee performance see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information about our credit risk mitigation related to derivatives and collateralized agreements our client activities involve the execution settlement and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis credit exposure results from client margin loans which are monitored daily and are collateralized by the securities in the clients accounts we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analysis on a daily basis in connection with our margin lending activities we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions in addition when clients execute a raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis purchase we are at some risk that the client will default on their financial obligation associated with the trade if this occurs we may have to liquidate the position at a loss we offer loans to financial advisors for recruiting and retention purposes we have credit risk and may incur a loss primarily in the event that such borrower is no longer affiliated with us see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information about our loans to financial advisors banking activities raymond james bank has a substantial loan portfolio while our bank loan portfolio is diversified a significant downturn in the overall economy such as that experienced in our fiscal year as a result of the covid19 pandemic deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where we have a concentration will generally result in large provisions for credit losses andor chargeoffs conversely should the economy recover at a faster pace than initially forecasted or the negative impact of the significant downturn event be less than originally projected we may experience a benefit for credit losses andor recovery of amounts previously charged off the timing and magnitude of which can be uncertain we determine the allowance required for specific loan grades based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis we evaluate our methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and make enhancements we consider appropriate our strategy for credit risk management related to bank loans includes welldefined credit policies uniform underwriting criteria and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all corporate taxexempt residential sbl and other credit exposures the strategy also includes diversification on a geographic industry and client level regular credit examinations and management reviews of all corporate and taxexempt loans as well as individual delinquent residential loans the credit risk management process also includes an annual independent review of the credit risk monitoring process that performs assessments of compliance with credit policies risk ratings and other critical credit information we seek to identify potential problem loans early record any necessary risk rating changes and chargeoffs promptly and maintain appropriate reserve levels for expected losses we utilize a comprehensive credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and taxexempt loans and related unfunded lending commitments including the probability of default andor loss given default of each corporate and taxexempt loan and commitment outstanding for our sbl and residential mortgage loans we utilize the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loans our allowance for credit losses methodology is described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k as our bank loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments likewise the allowance for credit losses is segregated by these same segments the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows ci loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by all assets of the business repayment is expected from the cash flows of the respective business unfavorable economic and political conditions including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment cre loans in this segment are primarily secured by incomeproducing properties for owneroccupied properties the cash flows are derived from the operations of the business and the underlying cash flows may be adversely affected by the deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business the underlying cash flows generated by nonowneroccupied properties may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and rental rates which are monitored on a quarterly basis this portfolio segment includes cre construction loans which also look at other risks such as project budget overruns and performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors with respect to commercial construction of residential developments there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments adverse information arising from any of these factors may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment reit loans in this segment are made to businesses that own or finance incomeproducing real estate across various property sectors this portfolio segment may include extensions of credit to companies that engage in real estate development repayment of these loans is dependent on income generated from real estate properties or the sale of real estate a portion of this segment may consist of loans secured by residential product types singlefamily residential including condominiums and land held for residential development within a range of markets deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business reductions in the value of real estate as well as increased vacancy and rental rates may all adversely affect the loans in this segment raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis taxexempt loans in this segment are made to governmental and nonprofit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and in some cases by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed for loans to governmental entities repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes for nonprofit entities repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds these loans are subject to demographic risk therefore much of the credit assessment of taxexempt loans is driven by the entitys revenue base and the general economic environment adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment residential mortgage includes home equity loanslines all of our residential mortgage loans adhere to stringent underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history debttoincome ratio of borrower loantovalue ltv and combined ltv including second mortgagehome equity loans we do not originate or purchase adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with negative amortization reverse mortgages or loans to subprime borrowers loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are also not originated or purchased all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower a decline in the strength of the economy particularly unemployment rates and housing prices among other factors could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment sbl and other loans in this segment are collateralized generally by the borrowers marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards these loans are monitored daily for adherence to ltv guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required ltv a collateral call is issued past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of the collateral which will bring the loan to a current status in evaluating credit risk we consider trends in loan performance the level of allowance coverage relative to similar banking institutions industry or client concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors both current and forecasted these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net chargeoffs our allowance for credit losses as of september was determined under the cecl model due to our october adoption of the standard see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information our allowance for credit losses as well as our methodologies and assumptions used in estimating the allowance are regularly evaluated to determine if our methods and estimates continue to be appropriate for each class of loans with adjustments made on a quarterly basis several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the allowance for credit losses at september including loan and borrower characteristics such as internal risk ratings delinquency status collateral type and the remaining term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments in addition the estimate of credit losses considered the relatively small amount of net chargeoffs during the period the level of nonperforming loans and the impact of the covid19 pandemic we also considered the uncertainty related to certain industry sectors including commercial real estate and the extent of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio finally we considered current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio we continue to assess the impact of both the covid19 pandemic and the economic recovery therefrom as new information becomes available regarding the financial repercussions to our borrowers the risk ratings for individual loans will be updated and the allowance will be adjusted accordingly raymond james

consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for loan categories as a percentage of total bank loans raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis we have received requests from certain borrowers for forbearance which is generally a shortterm deferral of their loan payments or modification of certain covenant terms driven or exacerbated by the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic based on the amortized costs approximately million and million of our corporate and residential loans respectively were in active forbearance as of september as certain borrowers exit forbearance we have received requests for loan modifications including repayment plans in accordance with the cares act and the consolidated appropriations act we are not applying tdr classification to any covid19 related loan modifications performed from march through december to borrowers who were current as of december as of september we had residential loans of million for which the borrower had requested a loan modification where the request had been initiated but not completed or approved as the delinquency status is not affected for loans that are in active forbearance or for loan modifications that have not yet been approved the recognition of chargeoffs delinquencies and nonaccrual status could be delayed for those borrowers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status forbearance and modification requests have continued to decline and the majority of the borrowers that have exited forbearance but have not requested loan modifications have become current on their principal and interest payments loan underwriting policies a component of raymond james banks credit risk management strategy is conservative welldefined policies and procedures raymond james banks underwriting policies for the major types of loans are described in the following sections residential mortgage and sbl and other loan portfolios our

and lifetime interest rate caps a significant portion of our originated or 30year fixedrate mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market our sbl and other portfolio is primarily comprised of loans fully collateralized by clients marketable securities and represented of our total loan portfolio as of september the underwriting policy for the sbl and other portfolio primarily includes a review of collateral including ltv and a review of repayment history while we have chosen not to participate in any governmentsponsored loan modification programs our loan modification policy takes into consideration some of the programs parameters and supports every effort to assist borrowers within the guidelines of safety and soundness in general we consider the qualification terms outlined in the governmentsponsored programs as well as the affordability test and other factors we retain flexibility to determine the appropriate modification structure and required documentation to support the borrowers current financial situation before approving a modification short sales are also used by us to mitigate credit losses corporate and taxexempt loan portfolios our corporate and taxexempt loan portfolios were comprised of approximately borrowers the majority of which are underwritten managed and reviewed at our corporate headquarters location which facilitates close monitoring of the portfolio by credit risk personnel relationship officers and senior bank executives our corporate loan portfolio is diversified among a number of industries in both the us and canada and is comprised of project finance real estate loans commercial lines of credit and term loans the majority of which are participations in shared national credit snc or other large syndicated loans and taxexempt loans we are sometimes involved in the syndication of the loan at inception and some of these loans have been purchased in secondary trading markets the remainder of the corporate loan portfolio is comprised of smaller participations and direct loans there are no subordinated loans or mezzanine financings in the corporate loan portfolio our taxexempt loans are longterm loans to governmental and nonprofit entities these loans generally have lower overall credit risk but are subject to other risks that are not usually present with corporate clients including the risk associated with the constituency served by a local government and the risk in ensuring an obligation has appropriate tax treatment regardless of the source all corporate and taxexempt loans are independently underwritten to our credit policies and are subject to approval by a loan committee and credit quality is monitored on an ongoing basis by our lending staff our credit policies include criteria related to ltv limits based upon property type single borrower loan limits loan term and structure parameters including guidance on leverage debt service coverage ratios and debt repayment ability industry concentration raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis limits secondary sources of repayment municipality demographics and other criteria a large portion of our corporate loans are to borrowers in industries in which we have expertise through coverage provided by our capital markets research analysts approximately half of our corporate borrowers are public companies our corporate loans are generally secured by all assets of the borrower in some instances are secured by mortgages on specific real estate and with respect to taxexempt loans are generally secured by a pledge of revenue in a limited number of transactions loans in the portfolio are extended on an unsecured basis in addition corporate and taxexempt loans are subject to regulatory review risk monitoring process another component of credit risk strategy for our bank loan portfolio is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes including our internal loan review process for all residential sbl corporate and taxexempt credit exposures as well as our rigorous processes to manage and limit credit losses arising from loan delinquencies there are various other factors included in these processes depending on the loan portfolio residential mortgage and sbl and other loan portfolios the collateral securing our sbl and other portfolio is monitored on a recurring basis with marketable collateral monitored on a daily basis collateral adjustments as triggered by our monitoring procedures are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure our loans are adequately secured resulting in minimizing our credit risk collateral calls have been minimal relative to our sbl and other portfolio with no losses incurred to date we track and review many factors to monitor credit risk in our residential mortgage loan portfolio the factors include but are not limited to loan performance trends loan product parameters and qualification requirements borrower credit scores level of documentation loan purpose geographic concentrations average loan size risk rating and ltv ratios see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional
