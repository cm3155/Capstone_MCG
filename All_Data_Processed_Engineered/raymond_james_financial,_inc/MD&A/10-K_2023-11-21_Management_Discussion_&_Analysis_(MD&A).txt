table end introduction the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition this mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements where nm is used in various percentage change computations the computed percentage change has been determined to be not meaningful we operate as a financial holding company and bank holding company results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets changes in interest rates market volatility corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends overall market conditions economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants including investors borrowers and competitors impacting their level of participation in the financial markets these factors also impact the level of investment banking activity and asset valuations which ultimately affect our business results executive overview year ended september compared with the year ended september for the year ended september we generated net revenues of billion and pretax income of billion up and compared with the prior year our net income available to common shareholders of billion was higher than the prior year and our earnings per diluted share of reflected a increase our return on common equity roce was compared with for the prior year and our return on tangible common equity rotce was compared with for the prior year the year ended september included million of net expenses related to acquisitions completed in prior years and the favorable impact of an insurance settlement received during the year related to a previouslysettled legal matter excluding these items our adjusted net income available to common shareholders was billion an increase of compared with the prior year and our adjusted earnings per diluted share were an increase of adjusted roce for the year was compared with in the prior year and adjusted rotce was compared with in the prior year the increase in net revenues compared with the prior year was driven by the benefit of significantly higher shortterm interest rates in the current year on both net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks as well as incremental revenues arising from our prioryear acquisitions of charles stanley group plc charles stanley tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital and sumridge partners these increases were offset by lower investment banking and brokerage revenues primarily due to a more challenging market environment during the current year and a decline in asset management and related administrative fees primarily attributable to lower pcg client assets in feebased accounts at the beginning of each of the currentyear quarterly billing periods compensation commissions and benefits expense was flat with the prior year as the impact of the decrease in compensable revenues compared with the prior year was offset by incremental expenses arising from our prioryear acquisitions of charles stanley tristate capital and sumridge partners as well as an increase in compensation costs to support our growth and annual salary increases our compensation ratio was compared with for the prior year excluding acquisitionrelated compensation expenses our adjusted compensation ratio was compared with for the prior year the decline in the compensation ratio from the prior year primarily resulted from changes in our revenue mix due to higher net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks which have little associated direct compensation rotce adjusted net income available to common shareholders adjusted earnings per diluted share adjusted roce adjusted rotce and adjusted compensation ratio are nongaap financial measures please see the reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap financial measures in this mda for a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures and for other important disclosures table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis table end noncompensation expenses increased million or this increase resulted from multiple items including elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters during the current year for a number of matters totaling approximately million a portion of which related to the sec industry sweep on offplatform communications as well as incremental expenses arising from our prioryear acquisitions of charles stanley tristate capital and sumridge partners and increases in communications and information processing expenses business development expenses and the bank loan provision for credit losses partially offsetting these increases was the aforementioned favorable insurance settlement received the bank loan provision for credit losses was million for the current year compared with a provision of million for the prior year which included an initial provision for credit losses of million on loans acquired as part of the tristate capital acquisition the bank loan provision for credit losses for the current year primarily reflected the impacts of a weakened macroeconomic outlook for certain loan portfolios including a weakened outlook for commercial real estate prices compared with the prior year chargeoffs of certain loans and loan downgrades during the year these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of loan repayments and sales which had a larger impact on the current fiscal year expense than provisions on new loans our effective income tax rate was for fiscal a decrease from for the prior year the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to the impact on our provision for income taxes of nontaxable valuation gains associated with our companyowned life insurance policies in the current year compared with nondeductible valuation losses in the prior year partially offset by an increase in our effective income tax rate arising from nondeductible fines and penalties in december the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend on common shares to per share and authorized common stock repurchases of up to billion during the twelve months ended september we repurchased million shares of our common stock under the board of directors common stock repurchase authorization for million at an average price of per share after the effect of those repurchases million remained under our board of directors common stock repurchase authorization we currently expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in fiscal to offset the impact of shares issued with the acquisition of tristate capital as well as to offset dilution from sharebased compensation however we will continue to monitor market conditions and other capital needs as we consider these repurchases as of september our tier leverage ratio of and total capital ratio of were both more than double the regulatory requirement to be considered wellcapitalized we also continued to have substantial liquidity with billion of rjf corporate cash as of september which includes parent cash loaned to rja to invest on its behalf we believe our capital and funding position provide us the opportunity to manage our balance sheet prudently and to continue to be opportunistic and invest in growth we also have access to significant sources of funding for our business activities should the need arise including borrowings against the million balance available on our revolving credit facility which was renewed and increased from million in april as well as nearly billion of fhlb borrowing capacity in the bank segment as we look ahead in spite of our expectation for economic uncertainty in the near term we believe we are wellpositioned for longterm growth with our strong capital position and total client assets under administration of trillion our financial advisor recruiting activity increased in the latter half of fiscal and our recruiting pipeline remains strong across our affiliation options we expect our fiscal first quarter of asset management and related administrative fee revenues to be negatively impacted by the decrease in feebased account balances from june to september as well as an estimated decline in our combined net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks reflecting the impact from highercost diversified funding sources including our esp which was launched to pcg clients in march while we have a healthy investment banking pipeline and saw improvement in investment banking activity in our fiscal fourth quarter of we anticipate that market uncertainty may continue to adversely impact the pace and timing of closings early in fiscal impacting our investment banking revenues we also expect to continue to experience headwinds for fixed income brokerage revenues due to the decline in cash balances at many of our depository institution clients finally although we have proactively taken steps to manage our credit risk in our loan portfolio including selling approximately million of par value of corporate loans during fiscal future economic deterioration or changes in our macroeconomic outlook could result in increased bank loan provisions for credit losses in future periods year ended september compared with the year ended september refer to item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our sandreports within other reports and information table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis table end banking operations our bank segment maintains an interestearning asset portfolio that is comprised of cash sbl ci loans cre loans reit loans residential mortgage loans and taxexempt loans as well as securities held in the availableforsale securities portfolio these interestearning assets are primarily funded by client deposits based on the current asset portfolio our banking operations are subject to interest rate risk we analyze interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid and the net portfolio valuation both across a range of interest rate scenarios one of the objectives of our asset and liability committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit interest rate risk in our banking operations including scenario analysis and economic value of equity eve we utilize hedging strategies using interest rate swaps in our banking operations as a component of our asset and liability management process for further information regarding this hedging strategy see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k we also manage interest rate risk as part of our liquidity management framework see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources of this form 10k for further information to ensure that we remain within the tolerances established for net interest income a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated under a variety of scenarios we use simulation models and estimation techniques to assess the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates the model estimates the sensitivity by calculating interest income and interest expense in a dynamic balance sheet environment using current repricing prepayment and reinvestment of cash flow assumptions over a 12month time horizon assumptions used in the model include interest rate movement the slope of the yield curve and balance sheet composition and growth the model also considers interest raterelated risks such as pricing spreads pricing of client cash accounts including deposit betas and prepayments various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income the following table is an analysis of our banking operations estimated net interest income over a 12month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates expressed in basis points using our previously described assetliability model which assumes a dynamic balance sheet a weighted average deposit beta on our interestbearing deposit accounts without stated maturities of approximately as interest rates rise and approximately as interest rates fall and that interest rates do not decline below zero while not presented additional rate scenarios are performed including interest rate ramps and yield curve shifts that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements we also perform simulations on time horizons of up to five years to assess longerterm impacts to various interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis we test expected model results to actual performance additionally any changes made to key assumptions in the model are documented and approved by the asset and liability committee table start instantaneous changes in rate net interest income in millions projected change in net interest income table end our 0basis point scenario was based on interest rates as of september the preceding table does not include the impacts of an instantaneous change in interest rates on net interest income on assets and liabilities outside of our banking operations or on our rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks which are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and are included in account and service fees on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net interest analysis of this form 10k for a discussion of the impact changes in shortterm interest rates could have on the consolidated firms operations we have classified all of our investments in debt securities as availableforsale and have not classified any of our investments in debt securities as heldtomaturity in our availableforsale securities portfolio we hold primarily fixedrate agencybacked mbs agencybacked cmos and us treasuries which are carried at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in the fair value of the portfolio recorded through other comprehensive income oci on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income as the majority of our availableforsale securities portfolio is comprised of us government and government agencybacked securities changes in fair value are primarily driven by changes table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis table end in interest rates at september our availableforsale securities portfolio had a fair value of billion with a weightedaverage yield of and a weightedaverage life after factoring in estimated prepayments of years to evaluate the interest rate sensitivity of our availableforsale securities portfolio we also monitor among other things effective duration defined as the approximate percentage change in price for a 100basis point change in rates as of september the effective duration of our availableforsale securities portfolio was approximately which means that we would expect the market value of our availableforsale securities portfolio to decline approximately for every 100basis point increase in interest rates and increase approximately for every 100basis point decline in interest rates see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information on our availableforsale securities portfolio the asset and liability committee also reviews eve which is a pointintime analysis of current interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives discounted at current rates the eve approach is based on a static balance sheet and provides an indicator of future earnings and capital levels as the changes in eve indicate the anticipated change in the value of future cash flows we monitor sensitivity to changes in eve utilizing board of directorsapproved limits these limits set a risk tolerance to changing interest rates and assist in determining strategies for mitigating this risk as eve approaches these limits as of september our eve analyses were within approved limits the following table shows the maturities of our bank loan portfolio at september including contractual principal repayments maturities are generally determined based upon contractual terms however rollovers or extensions that are included for the purposes of measuring the allowance for credit losses are reflected in maturities in the following table this table does not include any estimates of prepayments which could shorten the average loan lives and cause the actual timing of the loan repayments to differ

managements discussion and analysis table end equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk as a result of our capital markets activities our brokerdealer activities are generally clientdriven and we carry equity securities as part of our trading inventory to facilitate such activities although the amounts are not as significant as our fixed income trading inventory we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions each day and establishing position limits equity securities held in our trading inventory are generally included in var in addition we have a private equity portfolio included in other investments on our consolidated statements of financial condition which is primarily comprised of investments in thirdparty funds see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information on this portfolio foreign exchange risk we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the usd for example our bank loan portfolio includes loans which are denominated in canadian dollars totaling billion and billion at september and respectively when converted to usd a majority of such loans are held in a canadian subsidiary of raymond james bank which is discussed in the following sections investments in foreign subsidiaries raymond james bank has an investment in a canadian subsidiary resulting in foreign exchange risk to mitigate its foreign exchange risk raymond james bank utilizes shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts these derivatives are primarily accounted for as net investment hedges in the consolidated financial statements see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information regarding these derivatives at september we had foreign exchange risk in our investment in rj ltd of cad million and in our investment in charles stanley of million which were not hedged at september we had other less significant investments in foreign domiciled subsidiaries primarily in europe which were not hedged however we do not believe we had material foreign exchange risk either individually or in the aggregate pertaining to these subsidiaries as of september foreign exchange gainslosses related to our foreign investments are primarily reflected in oci on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information regarding our components of oci transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the usd we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our holdings of cash and certain other assets and liabilities resulting from transactions denominated in a currency other than the usd any currencyrelated gainslosses arising from these foreign currency denominated balances are reflected in other revenues in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of such transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency are mitigated utilizing shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts such derivatives are not designated hedges and therefore the related gainslosses are included in other revenues in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for information regarding our derivatives credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrowers issuers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreedupon terms the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction the structure and duration of that transaction and the parties involved credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities corporate activities we maintain cash balances with the fed and with various financial institutions primarily global systemically important financial institutions in our normal course of business a large portion of such balances are in excess of fdic insurance limits as a result we may be exposed to the risk that these financial institutions may not return our cash to us in the event that the institution experiences financial distress or ceases its operations in order to mitigate our credit risk to such financial table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis table end institutions we monitor our exposure with each institution on a daily basis and subject each institution to limits based on various factors including but not limited to financial strength capitalization levels liquidity credit ratings and market factors to the extent applicable brokerage activities we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which our counterparties primarily include brokerdealers banks exchanges clearing organizations and other financial institutions we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations in addition certain commitments including underwritings may create exposure to individual issuers and businesses the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty andor the issuer of the instrument in addition we may be subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions in or have large commitments to a single counterparty borrower or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry we seek to mitigate these risks by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties reviewing security derivative and loan concentrations holding collateral as security for certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations which may guarantee performance see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information about our credit risk mitigation related to derivatives and collateralized agreements our client activities involve the execution settlement and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis credit exposure results from client margin loans which are monitored daily and are collateralized by the securities in the clients accounts we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities on a daily basis in connection with our margin lending activities we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions in addition when clients execute a purchase we are at some risk that the client will default on their financial obligation associated with the trade if this occurs we may have to liquidate the position at a loss see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information about our determination of the allowance for credit losses associated with certain of our brokerage lending activities we offer loans to financial advisors for recruiting and retention purposes we have credit risk and may incur a loss primarily in the event that such borrower is no longer affiliated with us see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information about our loans to financial advisors banking activities our bank segment has a substantial loan portfolio our strategy for credit risk management related to bank loans includes welldefined credit policies uniform underwriting criteria and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all credit exposures the strategy also includes diversification across loan types geographic locations industries and clients regular credit examinations and management reviews of all corporate and taxexempt loans as well as individual delinquent residential loans the credit risk management process also includes independent reviews at least annually of the credit risk monitoring process that performs assessments of compliance with credit policies risk ratings and other critical credit information we seek to identify potential problem loans early record any necessary risk rating changes and chargeoffs promptly and maintain appropriate reserve levels for expected losses we utilize a thorough credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and taxexempt loans and related unfunded lending commitments for our residential mortgage loans and substantially all of our sbl we utilize the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loans in evaluating credit risk we consider trends in loan performance historical experience through various economic cycles industry or client concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors both current and forecasted these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net chargeoffs table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis table end while our bank loan portfolio is diversified a significant downturn in the overall economy deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where we have a concentration will generally result in large provisions for credit losses andor chargeoffs we determine the allowance required for specific loan pools based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis we evaluate our methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and make enhancements we consider appropriate our allowance for credit losses methodology is described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k as our bank loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments likewise the allowance for credit losses is segregated by these same segments the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows sbl loans in this segment are primarily collateralized by the borrowers marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards and to a lesser extent the cash surrender value of life insurance policies issued by an investmentgrade insurance company an insignificant portion of our sbl portfolio is collateralized by private securities or other financial instruments with a limited trading market substantially all sbl are monitored daily for adherence to loantovalue ltv guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required ltv a collateral call is issued past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of the collateral which will bring the loan to a current status the vast majority of our sbl qualify for the practical expedient allowed under the cecl guidance whereby we estimate zero credit losses to the extent the fair value of the collateral securing the loan equals or exceeds the related carrying value of the loan sbl also generally qualify for lower capital requirements under regulatory capital rules ci loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by all assets of the business repayment including for owneroccupied properties is expected from the cash flows of the respective business unfavorable economic and political conditions including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment cre loans in this segment are primarily secured by incomeproducing properties the underlying cash flows generated by properties securing these loans may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and decreases in rental rates which are monitored on an ongoing basis this portfolio segment includes cre construction loans which involve risks such as project budget overruns performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors or the inability to sell the project or secure permanent financing once the project is completed with respect to commercial construction of residential developments there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments adverse information arising from any of these factors may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment reit loans in this segment are made to businesses that own or finance incomeproducing real estate across various property sectors this portfolio segment may include extensions of credit to companies that engage in real estate development repayment of these loans is dependent on income generated from real estate properties or the sale of real estate a portion of this segment may consist of loans secured by residential product types singlefamily residential including condominiums and land held for residential development within a range of markets deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business reductions in the value of real estate as well as increased vacancy and decreases in rental rates may all adversely affect the loans in this segment residential mortgage includes home equity loanslines all of our residential mortgage loans adhere to stringent underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history debttoincome ratio of the borrower ltv and combined ltv including second mortgagehome equity loans we do not originate or purchase adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with negative amortization reverse mortgages or loans to subprime borrowers loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are also not originated or purchased all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower a decline in the strength of the economy particularly unemployment rates and housing prices among other factors could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment taxexempt loans in this segment are made to governmental and nonprofit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and in some cases by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed for loans to governmental entities repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes for nonprofit entities repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds these loans are subject to demographic risk therefore much of the credit assessment of taxexempt loans is driven by the entitys revenue base and the general economic environment adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis table end the level of chargeoff activity is a factor that is considered in evaluating the potential severity of future credit losses the following table presents net loan chargeoffsrecoveries and the percentage of net loan chargeoffsrecoveries to the average outstanding loan balances by

returned to accrual status in accordance with our policy although our nonperforming assets as a percentage of our bank segments assets remained low as of september any prolonged period of market deterioration could result in an increase in our nonperforming assets an increase in our allowance for credit losses andor an increase in net chargeoffs in future periods although the extent would depend on future developments that are highly uncertain see further explanation of our bank loan portfolio segments allowance for credit losses and the credit loss provision in notes and of the notes

of loans are described in the following sections sbl portfolio our sbl portfolio represented of our total loans held for sale and investment as of september this portfolio is primarily comprised of loans fully collateralized by a borrowers marketable securities and to a lesser extent the cash surrender value of life insurance policies issued by an investmentgrade insurance company an insignificant portion of our sbl portfolio is collateralized by private securities or other financial instruments with a limited trading market the underwriting policy for the sbl portfolio primarily includes a review of collateral including ltv and a review of repayment history table start raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis table end corporate and taxexempt loan portfolios our corporate and taxexempt loan portfolios were comprised of approximately borrowers as of september of these loan portfolios approximately was comprised of loans to larger companies with earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization greater than million of which approximately were loans to public companies the remaining was primarily focused on middlemarket businesses located within the primary markets of pennsylvania ohio new jersey and new york we have offices in each of these states led by experienced regional presidents to understand the unique borrowing needs and credit risk of the middlemarket businesses in the area they are supported by highly experienced relationship managers who target middlemarket business customers with annual revenues of million to million our corporate loan portfolio is diversified by geography by loan type and among a number of industries in the us and canada and a large portion of these loans are to borrowers in industries in which we have expertise through coverage provided by our capital markets research analysts our corporate loans include project finance real estate loans commercial lines of credit and term loans the majority of which are participations in shared national credit snc or other large syndicated loans we are typically either involved in the syndication of the loans at inception or purchase loans in secondary trading markets the remainder of the corporate loan portfolio is comprised of smaller participations and direct loans there are no subordinated loans or mezzanine financings in the corporate loan portfolio our taxexempt loans are longterm loans to governmental and nonprofit entities these loans generally have lower overall credit risk but are subject to other risks that are not usually present with corporate clients including the risk associated with the constituency served by a local government and the risk in ensuring an obligation has appropriate tax treatment the majority of our corporate and taxexempt loan portfolios are underwritten managed and reviewed at one of our corporate locations while the remainder are approved by a committee of senior executives both of which facilitates close monitoring of the portfolio by credit risk personnel relationship officers and senior bank executives all corporate and taxexempt loans are independently underwritten to our credit policies are subject to approval by a loan committee and credit quality is monitored on an ongoing basis by our lending staff our credit policies include criteria related to ltv limits based upon property type single borrower loan limits loan term and structure parameters including guidance on leverage debt service coverage ratios and debt repayment ability industry concentration limits secondary sources of repayment municipality demographics and other criteria our corporate loans are generally secured by all assets of the borrower and in some instances are secured by mortgages on specific real estate taxexempt loans are generally secured by a pledge of revenue in a limited number of transactions loans in the portfolio are extended on an unsecured basis in addition corporate and taxexempt loans are subject to regulatory review residential mortgage loan portfolio our residential mortgage loan portfolio largely consists of first

first lien residential mortgage loans were arm loans which receive interestonly payments based on a fixed rate for an initial period of the loan ranging from the first five to fifteen years depending on the loan and then become fully amortizing subject to annual and lifetime interest rate caps a significant portion of our originated or 30year fixedrate residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market risk monitoring process another component of credit risk strategy for our bank loan portfolio is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes including our internal loan review process as well as our rigorous processes to manage and limit credit losses arising from loan delinquencies there are various other factors included in these processes depending on the loan portfolio sbl and residential mortgage loan portfolios substantially all collateral securing our sbl portfolio is monitored on a daily basis collateral adjustments as triggered by our monitoring procedures are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure our loans are adequately secured resulting in minimizing our credit risk collateral calls have been minimal relative to our sbl portfolio with insignificant

first mortgages are serviced by a third party whereby the primary collection effort resides with the servicer our personnel direct and actively monitor the servicers efforts through extensive communications regarding individual loan status changes and through requirements of timely and appropriate collection of property management actions and reporting including management of third parties used in the collection process eg appraisers attorneys etc residential mortgage loans over days past due are generally reviewed by our personnel monthly and documented in a written report detailing delinquency information balances collection status appraised value and other data points our senior management meets quarterly to discuss the status collection strategy and chargeoff recommendations on substantially all residential mortgage loans over days past due updated collateral valuations are generally obtained for loans over days past due and chargeoffs are typically taken on individual loans based on these valuations generally before the loan is days past due credit risk is also managed by diversifying the residential mortgage portfolio most of the loans in our residential loan

andor chargeoffs on our loans in such states and therefore negatively impact our net income and regulatory capital in any given period loans where borrowers may be subject to payment increases include arm loans with terms that initially require payment of interest only payments may increase significantly when the interestonly period ends and the loan principal begins to amortize at september and these loans totaled billion and billion respectively or approximately and of the residential mortgage portfolio respectively the weightedaverage number of years before the remainder of the loans which were still in their interestonly period at september begins amortizing is six years corporate and taxexempt loans credit risk in our corporate and taxexempt loan portfolios is monitored on an individual loan basis for trends in borrower operating performance payment history credit ratings collateral performance loan covenant compliance municipality demographics and other factors including industry performance and concentrations as part of the credit review process the loan rating is reviewed on an ongoing basis to confirm the appropriate risk rating for each credit the individual loan ratings resulting from semiannual snc exams are incorporated in our internal loan ratings when the ratings are received if the snc rating is lower on an individual loan than our internal rating the
