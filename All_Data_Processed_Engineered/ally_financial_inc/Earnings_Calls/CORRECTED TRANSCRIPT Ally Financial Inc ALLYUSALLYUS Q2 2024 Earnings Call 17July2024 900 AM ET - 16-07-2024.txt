of us is inspiring our culture of customer obsession and focused execution position us well for continued success in our respective markets now lets turn to page to cover second quarter highlights second quarter adjusted eps of and billion in revenue reflect solid financial results from consistent operational execution we saw strong improvements following the first quarter earnings trough that weve messaged for some time nim excluding oid of is up basis points quarteroverquarter driven by momentum on both sides of the balance sheet and we expect continued expansion from here on the capital front we recently closed our first credit risk transfer transaction which had strong investor demand leading to strong pricing and execution crts another tool in our tool kit to generate capital and better serve our dealer customers last month we received feds stress test results our preliminary stress capital buffer is effective october as most of you are aware we operate with a significant buffer to the scb moving to operational results in auto we decisioned a  record million consumer auto applications and generated billion of originations retail auto originated yields of with of the volume in our highest credit tier this reflects our strong pricing position and strategic underwriting approach and points of retail auto net chargeoffs were in line with recent investor guidance at a conference last month insurance written premium of million are up yearoveryear driven by continued momentum in our fi and pc products turning to ally bank deposits were down quarteroverquarter and flat for the year in line with our expectations for seasonal tax outflows in the quarter we added customers and now have million depositors we are fully funded with deposits and given our outlook for a largely flat balance sheet we are wellpositioned to continue leveraging our highquality deposit portfolio to generate strong returns across our businesses weve been very measured on our growth in the credit card business including curtailment actions over the past months credit performance in this portfolio is in line with expectations corporate finance balances remain steady quarteroverquarter and the portfolio which is first lien continue to generate steady returns second quarter roe was north of and we continue to provide resources to help our team serve our customers were pleased with the solid financial and operational results this quarter and we remain confident in our ability to grow earnings from here and with that ill turn it over to russ russell e hutchinson chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you michael good morning everyone ill begin on slide in the second quarter net financing revenue excluding oid of billion was lower yearoveryear driven by higher interest rates results were up million quarteroverquarter as pricing actions on retail deposits drove cost of funds lower while earning asset yields ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 continue to expand driven by the strength in fixed rate asset repricing we expect asset yields to continue expanding over the medium term as lower yielding assets run off and are replaced by new originations adjusted other revenue of million is up from prior year as we benefit from the momentum within insurance and diversified fee revenue from our smartauction and passthrough programs provision expense of million increased from the prior year driven by higher net chargeoffs and was down on a linked quarter basis as is the seasonal low point for retail auto ncos retail auto ncos were in line with guidance provided at an investor conference last month decreasing basis points quarteroverquarter retail auto losses continue to be pressured by the back book specifically the vintage we expect losses from the vintage peaked in and we expect ncos to moderate in the second half of on a seasonally adjusted basis ill cover retail auto credit and vintage dynamics in more detail later adjusted noninterest expense of billion was up yearoveryear primarily driven by growth in the insurance business and historically elevated weather losses also in insurance controllable noninterest expense was down more than yearoveryear and reflects our continued focus on expense discipline strong ev lease originations drove more than million in ev tax credits within the period resulting in a negative tax rate for the quarter we will provide more on our ev originations and tax implications later gaap and adjusted eps for the quarter were and respectively moving to slide net interest margin excluding oid of increased basis points quarteroverquarter in line with the guidance provided last month earning asset yields expanded basis points quarteroverquarter while funding costs decreased basis points reflecting strength on both sides of the balance sheet as expected average earning assets are down linked quarter largely as a result of proactive capital actions which include the sale of ally lending recent retail auto loan sales and the continued roll down of mortgage and securities balances lease yields were up basis points quarteroverquarter driven by an expected increase in lease termination volume on liabilities cost of funds decreased basis points within the quarter driven by our pricing actions on deposit products throughout the first half of the year the momentum on both sides of our balance sheet is in line with expectations our nim outlook is unchanged we expect to exit near and continue the march to nim as our loweryielding back book continues to be replaced by higheryielding originations and as weve said before our exit rate is not dependent on fed rate cuts we expect a nim run rate to be reached by the end of in a range of rate scenarios slide provides a look at the evolution of allys consumer deposits we are pleased with the strength of the deposit franchise retail deposits across all vintages since the inception of ally bank have been stable or grown reflecting a consistent retention rate above we have steadily grown customers by offering a comprehensive value proposition that includes attractive deposit rates our awardwinning digital platform high service levels and our range of nofee products and our customer growth continued in the second quarter we added deposit customers in the quarter and are now relentless allies with million customers as expected deposit balances declined by billion during the quarter to land flat for the first half of the year the decline in balances in the second quarter was driven by seasonality related to tax payments that was anticipated ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 the transformation of the bank over the past years has positioned ally to optimize for sustainable earnings moving forward our balance sheet is fully funded with deposits and the billion deposit portfolio is fdic insured we continue to target approximately flat deposit balances for the remainder of the year based on our balance sheet growth trajectory turning to page cet1 of increased quarteroverquarter we operate with a significant buffer to required cet1 minimums with billion of excess capital above our preliminary scb minimum as you know our preliminary scb is up basis points to following this years fed run stress test given the size of our buffer and the modest increase this change in scb does not impact the way were managing capital within the quarter we issued million in creditlinked notes against the billion reference pool of prime auto loans that generated basis points of cet1 benefit at closing we were pleased with the execution and i will touch on credit risk transfer in more detail on the next slide we recently announced our quarterly dividend of for the third quarter which remains consistent with the prior quarter on the bottom of the slide you can see the trend of tangible book value over time excluding the temporary impact of oci we closed the quarter with adjusted tangible book value of with the earnings trajectory in front of us and the natural pull to par on the securities portfolio were confident in our ability to drive solid book value growth over the next several years on slide we provide details on our first credit risk transfer transaction ally has a long history in the securitization market with an established infrastructure and investor base which supported our success in pricing and overall execution in conjunction with the transaction we issued million of creditlinked notes with a coupon just over that is partially offset by our investment income on a corresponding cash collateral account the transaction reduces rwa on the reference portfolio of billion of prime retail auto loans from to and introduces another lever for dynamic capital management while we meaningfully reduced the risk weighting on the pool we retain of the economics on the assets and the net cost of the mezzanine notes equates to less than basis point of nim the transaction increased cet1 by basis points at closing and given the amortizing nature of the underlying assets the capital benefit will amortize as the loans pay down the crt is another indication of strong market appetite for our loans and our ability to reduce rwa to free up capital consistent with how we use other capital management levers well remain opportunistic in the crt space going forward lets turn to slide to review asset quality trends the consolidated net chargeoff rate of basis points was down quarteroverquarter reflecting typical seasonality our commercial portfolios continue to demonstrate solid credit performance with no net chargeoff activity in corporate finance and a net recovery in commercial auto the credit card portfolio is performing in line with expectations and the net chargeoff rate of is consistent with the prior quarter based on what we are seeing in terms of delinquency we believe credit card ncos have peaked in line with the guidance we provided in december retail auto net chargeoffs of basis points were down basis points quarteroverquarter in the bottom right 30plus day delinquencies increased basis points quarteroverquarter due to seasonality and were up basis points on a yearoveryear basis the second quarter closed on a weekend and as we talked about last quarter that does have an impact on the spot delinquency rate we report externally ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 looking throughout the month of june the average delinquency rate was up less than basis points on a year overyear basis delinquencies will increase through the second half of in line with seasonal patterns but we expect the yearoveryear increase to moderate further ill cover retail auto credit trends in more detail on a couple of slides consolidated coverage was flat quarteroverquarter and total reserves remained steady at billion retail auto coverage was unchanged at basis points our base case continues to assume no change in the retail auto coverage rate corporate finance continues to demonstrate solid credit performance and had no new nonperforming loans in the quarter we expect consistency in the coverage rates across the portfolio near term barring any shifts in the macro environment on slide we provide further detail around retail auto credit retail ncos of basis points were consistent with the preview provided in early june but roughly basis points higher than our expectations entering the quarter the current pressure on ncos continues to come from the back book particularly the vintage which accounted for of retail auto ncos in the first half of the year that vintage has moved past the typical point of peak loss for a vintage and will be a smaller contributor to losses going forward the majority of our prospective loss content will be driven by vintages originated in and later given the meaningful shift up in credit in the second quarter of more specifically the increase in our stier credit mix for the past year we expect loss content to be lower in the front book than what weve seen on the vintage and we continue to see signs of that favorable performance when we compare delinquency rates of those two vintages at various months on book after months on book the vintage has a 30day delinquency rate thats basis points below the vintage that gap narrowed slightly from three months ago but we dont expect it to be a straight line given the dayoftheweek dynamics i touched on earlier weve provided this chart using averages throughout the month which we think is a more accurate view of delinquency the traditional spot dq comparison has also been provided delinquency is a key metric we use to assess expected loss content but there are other factors that give us confidence new originations will produce lower losses than the vintage we expect the front book to outperform from a flow to loss rate perspective given the increasing credit quality across borrower dimensions like fico and pti and we expect less severity pressure given the front book was underwritten below the peak in collateral values and with lower ltvs on collateral values weve seen a decline on a yeartodate basis and were anticipating another decline for the remainder of the year the total change of on a full year basis is unchanged from what weve provided in january putting all the moving pieces together we remain confident that our underwriting changes and shift in mix have resulted in a front book that will produce lower losses going forward turning to slide weve provided an update on trends were seeing in electric vehicles ev originations in the second quarter of billion represented of our total origination volume increased volume in the lease channel has been concentrated in battery electric vehicles as we entered into a new oem agreement in march importantly virtually all of our battery electric vehicle lease contracts come with residual guarantees from the oem that provide significant protection against declines in value while the expected economics of an ev lease are identical to an internal combustion engine vehicle there are some nuances that impact the timing and geography of the earnings stream as the owner of leased vehicles ally is entitled to the tax credit associated with the transaction we pass that benefit to the customer in the form of a ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 lower monthly payment reducing net interest income ally gets the full benefit of the tax credit which flows through the income statement as a reduction in tax expense so while the economics of ev and traditional internal combustion or ice leases are unchanged ev leases drive accelerated income through the tax line that is offset by lower net interest income over the full life of the lease given the size of our originations in the quarter that resulted in current tax benefits of approximately million and reduced the tax rate by approximately percentage points relative to traditional lease volume that creates a modest nim headwind going forward well talk more about the financial outlook shortly but we expect the momentum weve seen in ev leasing to result in a negative tax rate for the year but the lower revenue associated with ev lease is not material enough to change our nim outlook stepping back from the accounting dynamics this increase in volume is another example of how our auto business is wellpositioned for an evolving auto landscape were pleased with the riskadjusted returns were getting in the channel particularly with the residual value protection we have in place moving to slide to review the auto segment highlights pretax income of million was down from the prior year driven by higher funding cost provision expense and noninterest expense provision expense was primarily driven by elevated losses from the vintage noninterest expense was also up yearoveryear as servicing related costs increased in connection with elevated loss content on the origination side we continue to benefit from the strength and scale of our auto finance franchise robust application volume enabled us to sustain pricing while originating of our retail auto loan volume in our highest credit tier average fico of is up from prior period and the highest in over a decade retail auto originated yield of was down quarteroverquarter driven entirely by changes in mix as our pricing remained very consistent across the credit spectrum portfolio yields continue to migrate towards originated yields excluding the impact from hedges yields are up basis points quarteroverquarter as newer vintages make up a larger portion of the portfolio portfolio yields including hedges are on track for by yearend consistent with prior expectations lease trends are in the bottom right gains of million in the second quarter reflect higher lease termination volume terminations do have seasonality as we see elevated activity in the second quarter each year and termination volume is also impacted by how many contracts we wrote three years ago given our average lease term so results this quarter certainly had seasonality but we also saw the impact of elevated lease volume in the first half of lease volume was very strong in the industry and our volume was a high watermark since that time volumes have slowed and as a result we expect lower termination volumes going forward lower units combined with continued normalization of used values will reduce lease gains for the remainder of the lease termination and gain dynamics are a key reason weve guided to a range of to basis points of quarterly nim expansion for rather than a straight line turning to insurance on slide we recorded a pretax loss of million as higher weather losses more than offset strong growth in premium and investment revenue total written premiums of million increased yearoveryear we continue to see great momentum across the business increased losses on a linkedquarter and yearoveryear basis were driven by weather activity we saw the most active weather loss season in over a decade including the most severe hail activity in the past years ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 our reinsurance program materially reduced our net exposure within the quarter the team has been actively monitoring the impacts of hurricane beryl while claim activity can be filed on a lag we do not expect any material losses associated with the storm another example of the teams ability to help dealers minimize loss for named storms our focus in insurance remains on leveraging relationships in auto finance and growing earned premiums over time a key driver of our fee revenue expansion corporate finance results are on slide core pretax income of million is a record for corporate finance and demonstrates another quarter of steady returns with a roe of endofperiod hfi loans decreased quarteroverquarter as favorable capital markets conditions including a strong clo market led to elevated payoffs our portfolio remains welldiversified and is virtually all first lien and we will remain wellpositioned from a credit standpoint with criticized assets and nonaccrual loans near historic lows and limited commercial real estate exposure on the bottom of the page we highlight the return since our ipo corporate finance remains a steady and meaningful contributor to allys earnings profile with an average return on equity of since our success is driven by a relentless focus on our customers throughthecycle lending approach and mutually beneficial sponsor relationships while balances can be choppy quartertoquarter were committed to serving our customers and being disciplined about deploying capital and over time this is a business well continue to prudently grow turning to mortgage on slide mortgage generated pretax income of million and million of dtc originations heldforinvestment assets continued to decrease as we continue to allocate resources to our highestreturning businesses we remain committed to providing a bestinclass digital experience and driving operational efficiency within the business i will provide an update on our outlook before heading into qa in terms of net interest margin second quarter represented an inflection point and natural portfolio rollover will drive expansion from here with or without rate cuts we see third quarter expansion at the low end of our to basis point quarterly range given lease dynamics i talked about and expect to exit the year between and resulting in a full year nim of about basis points so relative to our last earnings call were increasing to the high end of our nim guide similarly we expect adjusted other revenue to be at the top of the range provided last quarter increasing yearoveryear momentum within insurance pc earned premiums through recent oem relationships and continued momentum in our other revenue streams more broadly gives us confidence in the revised outlook we have narrowed the range of our expected consolidated loss rate to to and we now see retail auto ncos of approximately as i noted earlier we continue to see pressure from the vintage but we remain pleased with what were seeing in the front book which will be the largest driver of losses beyond adjusted noninterest expense guidance is unchanged with controllable expenses expected to be down more than yearoveryear and total up less than we now expect average earning assets to be down this year reflecting the cumulative impact of all of the actions weve taken to manage rwa and capital levels in anticipation of regulatory changes last several quarters weve deconsolidated billion of loweryielding retail auto loans sold our pointofsale lending business and its billion portfolio and executed a credit risk transfer to create excess capital these actions not only create incremental capital but also improve overall returns on tax rate weve adjusted our full year guidance to a range of to negative based on our outlook for ev lease volume in the back half of the year ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 to wrap this was a solid quarter in terms of operational execution and financial results and we remain confident in achieving a nim of eps and midteens return run rate by the end of and with that ill turn it over to sean for qa sean leary headinvestor relations enterprise fpa ally financial inc thank you russ as we head into qa we do ask that participants limit yourself to one question and one follow up elizabeth please begin the qa question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone so michael you highlighted youve been in the role for about two months maybe just give us your initial impressions of the company and the strategy and as you think about the strategy this company has pursued any initial thoughts on potential changes to the strategy or the direction of the company michael george rhodes a chief executive officer director ally financial inc so ryan thanks for the question and nice to chat so as you mentioned in the prepared remarks i said a couple of things really reflect the fact how grateful i am to have inherited such a wellrespected and well positioned company and really a tremendous respect for what the team has built and one of the things that really drew me to ally was the evolution weve had over the past many years and i should underscore how well positioned we are for where banking is heading in the future and as you know we talked about strategy as a ceo an important part of my job is to constantly think about and evolve the strategy but right now my primary focus is to execute the plans we have in place i am incredibly fortunate to be walking into a situation with a strong several years ahead of us and believe were uniquely positioned in our industry with a very attractive earnings ramp and so its very important to me that we execute and so i just want to underscore that that im very much focused on execution now dont read this that were on autopilot rather well continue to optimize our use of capital and we will take a hard look at everything just dont expect any significant nearterm shifts ph as we get some way that we do it ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it maybe a question for russ regarding credit russ you gave a lot of color on credit regarding performance you talked about lower front book performance i guess given the tighter underwriting the burn off of which you showed on slide and then the stronger i think you highlighted moderating losses moderating on a seasonal basis but when do you think we start to see credit outperform seasonal expectations given all the ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 changes then move up market and can we make significant progress toward the targeted chargeoff level in thank you russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah no thanks for the question ryan great to be on with you again look okay i think as you think about kind of seasonal trends as we highlighted second quarter is a seasonal trough and so our expectation is to see kind of typical increase in ncos over the remainder of this year as we go into third and fourth quarter that being said that that kind of typical seasonal increase we expect to be mitigated as you pointed out as that vintage has passed peak loss period and really starts to burn off and so we do expect some mitigation in the normal seasonal increase that wed see going into third and fourth quarter and obviously our expectation is that continues into were not providing guidance on ncos yet as usual well kind of work through the remainder of the year and look to provide that kind of guidance early next year that being said we do as you pointed out expect to make progress towards ncos that we think over the kind of the medium term auto settle out somewhere in call it to range based on kind of how were underwriting today ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for the color russ operator our next question comes from a line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning and michael congratulations on your first call maybe just to followup on ryans questions maybe michael you could just talk about your opinion on the strategy of the company and sort of being a monoline in auto theres always been ideas to diversify into card you obviously have a background there can you just talk about philosophically like how you think about the composition of the asset base and sort of the strategy going forward michael george rhodes a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah no thanks for the question and great question so coming in the role ive obviously followed out ally from the outside and now being in the role one of the questions you always have to ask yourself from a highlevel strategy is where are we going to compete and how are we going to win and in terms of where were going to compete we do find that the i do find that the auto business is a very attractive ecosystem for us and i think ecosystem because its more than just the consumer loans we have commercial lending to the dealers we have insurance product we have some valueadded services such as the passthrough programs the smartauction and so like we really have a compelling reason why we can win in the auto space and so as you can imagine that thats we want to double down on where you have a real reason to win and so if you look at that and im just very pleased with where we are and then clearly on the banking side of the business what weve done with deposits is really quite remarkable again i said in my prepared comments everybody wants to build a digital bank and weve done that better than ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 anyone and thats great and weve had some places where our diversification is really taking hold i mean you see the commercial finance business and what thats done and then we have some emerging opportunities here and you can see that were being a little more slow in terms of what were trying to do in those emerging opportunities because the best use of capital right now is really in the things that we do very well and have defensible reasons to win and thats where youre going to see us allocating our expenses and our capital in the near term sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then apologies if i missed this but maybe russ if you could just talk about the originated yield i know it declined because of the mix and you guys went up more up market but was there anything else from a competitive standpoint that was affecting that originated yield or is it simply just mix russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc no its simply just mix and look mix will vary on a quartertoquarter basis i dont think were looking at this as any kind of a longterm trend our pricing was consistent across credit tiers and we got hit to a higher quality credit mix this time you see it most clearly obviously in the high percentage of the stier but you also see it more broadly with the fico moving up to for this quarters origination so its really just kind of normal fluctuations and again were not reading anything into it at this point sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning just wanted to clarify russ i think you talked about the yearoveryear delinquency 30plus day moderating going forward is that versus the basis points or the basis points perhaps just want to clarify that russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc great no i appreciate the clarification the basis points is kind of based on the endofquarter delinquencies and so as weve pointed out earlier and we pointed this out last quarter as well the day of the week has an impact on overall delinquency levels that is to say over the course of a typical week we see kind of different outcomes for delinquency so we typically get our kind of lower delinquencies on fridays and higher delinquencies on sundays this quarter ended on a sunday the comparative quarter ended on a friday and so that was in a sense a bad guy in terms of that overall measure of delinquency when we look at it on a daily average basis that 73basispoint delta based on the last day of the quarter is more like basis points on a daily average basis and so you kind of get a kind of a more kind of a steadystate ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 reflection of the delinquency trends as you compare the two months this month and sorry this quarter and the quarter a year ago and so thats a little bit more kind of context on the basis points and the basis points i think kind of given weve now had two quarters where weve had to talk about this dayoftheweek phenomenon i think you will see us going forward talk a little bit more about daily averages where its applicable that being said of course we know the industry and a lot of the reporting we do is on a kind of daily kind of endofthequarter basis and so thats going to continue but well try to provide a little bit more insight on the daily average basis just to basically just to mute that that dayoftheweek impact that weve been seeing donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc so i guess we should think about youd said it could moderate further would that be from like that or bps like just trying to think because the basis points was better than last quarter on a yearoveryear russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah thats right and so i think our expectation is moderating not necessarily in a straight line but moderating overall and so yes we do expect to see continued moderation both in terms of the last day of the quarter as well as the daily average the only thing id point out is there is that kind of embedded volatility in the last day of the quarter depending on which specific day of the week it falls on relative to the base quarter youre comparing it to donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for the clarification russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc great operator our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch with td cowen moshe orenbuch q analyst td securities usa llc great thanks hoping that you guys that maybe russ you could talk a little bit about the outperformance of the vintage versus how much do you think of that as being driven by kind of industry performance how much of it is ally and then can you relate to that what you talked about in terms of seeing kind of tighter underwriting for a lot of the period in and early and maybe some of those other factors that you talked about as to how do we can think about that even as we go forward into the vintage russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure so maybe ill start with kind of the first question the first part of your question us versus the industry and i think probably kind of i think the clearest and most definitive way to look at it is ill start maybe with the industry when you look at the trajectory of car prices both kind of where dealers were selling and where msrps were going as well as the used car prices they really peaked in and so from an industry perspective we all kind of get a tailwind from the fact that going forward were written loans and leases were basically underwritten ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 at less than peak prices for both new and used vehicles and so i think thats helpful for us its helpful for the industry flipping gears and just talking about ally specifically weve been making weve been tightening our underwriting consistently over the course of over the past more than the past year but in particular you see it as you go from first quarter of to second quarter of and thats where you really saw that step up in the proportion of our originations that are in our top credit tier the stier and so id say from  onwards you really see a change in terms of our overall underwriting and thats for us obviously thats very much ally specific but thats what i would point to as kind of the allyspecific part in terms of the change in the way weve underwritten you see it most clearly in that percentage of stier but you also see it kind of overall in just the overall way that weve underwritten weve effectively taken a microscope to our originations looking at our performance on a very discrete level looking at vintages and then looking at cuts within those vintages to understand how kind of various subsegments are performing and then calling underperforming segments and adjusting pricing as we move forward and so that again a lot of that kicked in the second quarter of and thats really where we attribute a large chunk of the improvement in what were seeing in the and forward vintages versus moshe orenbuch q analyst td securities usa llc got it thanks and maybe as kind of the followup question and michael wanted to add my welcome and congratulations so just to talk a little bit about capital maybe and thoughts about capital levels i saw the crt but maybe given that the financial markets have been better could you talk about the appetite for actual loan sales or securitization and sales of loans and how you would think about that in terms of managing the both capital levels and origination levels into the back half of the year and into russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah maybe ill start and michael can kind of add to it we have been very pleased with the markets receptivity to our loans its given us additional levers that we can use in terms of managing our overall capital levels and so youve seen obviously the crt the reception on the crt was fantastic i think we were very pleased with the outcome both in terms of pricing in terms of size in terms of the overall market demand for it you also saw us earlier in the first half and late last year in the abs market actually selling deeper into the residuals of our abs in order to get deconsolidation of loans so wed sold about billion of loans through the abs markets as well so another example of capital markets receptivity to our loans and so weve been very pleased with that we think that these capital levers give us additional flexibility that will allow us to both support our dealers and then ultimately return capital to our shareholders as we said before and as you know very well we continue to be very focused on capital build for now in anticipation of the new b3 capital rules that we expect at some point moshe orenbuch q analyst td securities usa llc great thank you michael george rhodes a chief executive officer director ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 moshe and moshe this is michael great to chat with you again its been a while but being the new guy in here and just kind of seeing what we have we have several very attractive tools that russ has covered and we are in a bit of a wait and see mode as it relates to basel and kind of whats going to happen there but id say that wed be very opportunistic and weve got the appropriate tools and were being very thoughtful about how we allocate our capital certainly now and then as we go forward moshe orenbuch q analyst td securities usa llc great thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of jeff adelson with morgan stanley jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah hi thanks for taking my question just wanted to circle back on the credit a little bit i know there a bit of a timing issue on the spot rate but if we look at the 60plus days the second derivative there does continue to shrink so just wondering is that something that does give you more confidence in the outlook for your chargeoff trajectory from here and then as we think about the spot rate dynamic here the weekend timing next quarter im sitting here looking at my calendar does end on a monday so is that something that could potentially help you guys next quarter reverse some of that spot dynamic youve been seeing russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah no great questions jeff and thanks and great to speak with you again id say first i think your observation on the 30plus versus the 60plus is very astute and id say just more broadly we continue to see very favorable trends in flow to loss and thats and part of that we believe is some of the changes that weve made both on the underwriting that we talked about earlier but also on the servicing side in terms of just making improvements to our overall servicing model to give our collectors a little bit more time to work the credits and to give our customers a little bit more time to correct and so agree with you that as we just look at the overall book as we look at flow to loss trends all those things are things that again give us confidence in terms of the credit outlook going forward jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great and then as my followup just tax rate i mean is there any reason why we shouldnt start thinking about this negative or really low tax rate as kind of the new norm here i mean its starting to feel like this could be a more of a recurring ongoing benefit even beyond is there any reason why that might not be the case russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc jeff another great question im glad you asked it you look at the quarter and as we pointed out a lot of the ev lease volume was driven by an oem relationship that we entered into in march and so really this was the first quarter where we had a full quarter of origination under this program ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 and we did obviously as you saw just over million of lease ev originations during the quarter obviously were pleased with that level of origination but again its a large chunk of that was driven by new agreement therell naturally be kind of ebbs and flows in that i wouldnt necessarily count on that specific level of volume each quarter but certainly our expectation is that were going to continue to originate these ev leases ph in size and its certainly our expectation that thats going to continue obviously through the remainder of driving down to the revised tax rate guidance we provided and that will also continue somewhat over the course of i would just like to reiterate while were talking about the ev leases the accounting for these leases as we pointed out using this the flow through method has the impact of kind of impacting nim to the negative weve considered that and obviously every quarter that we continue to do these ev leases theres more kind of downward pressure on nim weve anticipated that downward pressure and again we remain confident in the nim guidance that weve provided in terms of the exit rate for and then ultimately getting to a nim run rate at the end of and again thats with the headwind of these ev leases jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great thank you for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks guys for taking my questions hey michael welcome and congratulations and i share your hope in terms of what you set up front look id like to talk a little bit more about the ev originations and the residual guarantees im curious if there is a differential between your residual assumption and the guarantee level and if that could impact nim over time michael george rhodes a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yes thats a good question id say maybe just to start but the residual value guarantee provides real protection against the decline in values you probably noticed in our q for the first quarter we actually did provide a little bit more discussion around this ph a agreement weve entered in march and so theres a bit of more description around that residual value protection that being said as you think about lease gains on this particular portfolio going forward we do expect them to be muted but again its early days in terms of this agreement and as we mentioned earlier overall we do have an expectation of second quarter the lease gains we saw were obviously driven by just a seasonality as well as the just the level of origination lease originations we did three years ago back in the second quarter of and our expectation that lease terminations decline throughout the remainder this year as well as and so obviously that has an impact on lease gains going forward and again that is something that weve anticipated and weve baked into our guidance around net interest margin going forward for and ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it look the reason the residual guarantees on battery ev battery cars is so important is because of the rapid evolution of the technology and the rapid obsolescence of prior cars im curious if the oem partnership also is driving and increasing your mix of loan volume for batterypowered evs and if thats something that we need to think about in terms of residual values on a longterm basis as well in terms of recoveries michael george rhodes a chief executive officer director ally financial inc i think the agreement is more focused around lease since id say its certainly driving our origination of battery electric vehicle leases i dont believe its having any meaningful impact on our retail lending overall i would point out when we think about electric vehicles obviously we have a balance of hybrid electric as well as battery electric and the residual value performance on the hybrid electric is obviously quite a bit different versus the pure battery electric vehicles and a lot of our volume is driven by the battery electric side particularly when you look at the leased product and outside of this oem relationship richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thank you guys very much operator our last question today will come from rob wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp morning guys we noticed that you took cd pricing up in at least a couple of the products during the quarter wondering if theres anything to read into there on your ability to continue to push deposit costs lower and then what kind of deposit repricing are you baking into the expectation to exit the year with that to nim and then same question too for the in as well russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure yeah we have made selective changes to cd pricing its just basically a reaction to kind of specific conditions as well as just looking at that kind of specific cd maturities in terms of just kind of managing our overall cd maturity profile all that being said we dont anticipate any kind of broad changes to deposit pricing from where we are in advance of any moves by the federal reserve as weve said before as we think about just overall our nim trajectory for obviously the deposit pricing will depend to some extent on fed rate moves but our nim trajectory does not and that is to say that we believe that weve put hedging in place and weve managed our risk in such a way that our exit rate does not depend or rely upon fed rate cuts similarly as we look at and we look at our guidance to get to nim at the end of again weve looked at that under a variety of rate scenarios and as you could imagine our deposit pricing depends on to some extent kind of broader moves in rates by the fed and again looking at a broad range of scenarios we feel ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2024 comfortable based on our hedging based our overall asset mix between floating and fixed that we can hit the nim guidance in a range of scenarios robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thanks and then just one more appreciate the color on the credit risk transfer curious how big a tool you think this could be for ally going forward is it something youd expect to do frequently to the extent that the market appetite is there or should we think of these as more oneoff type transactions russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc theres certainly an opportunistic nature to them that being said we were very pleased with market appetite and demand and so its definitely a tool that we want to use and so i think our expectation is that well continue to use it youll see us print these from time to time i certainly wouldnt expect them every quarter but its certainly a tool that we expect to reuse robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you sean leary headinvestor relations enterprise fpa ally financial inc thanks rob thanks russ showing a little past the top
