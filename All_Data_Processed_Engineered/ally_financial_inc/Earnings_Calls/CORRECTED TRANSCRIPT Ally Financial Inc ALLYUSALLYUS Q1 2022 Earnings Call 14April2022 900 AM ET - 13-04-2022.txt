reflects years of disciplined execution of building adaptable platforms that will allow us to grow and capitalize on market opportunities in a wide variety of operating environments more specifically we remain confident in our longterm outlook for a sustainable rotce profile of to plus with the potential for outperformance in as the environment normalizes our earnings trajectory has positioned us to execute a billion buyback program for the second consecutive year and yesterday we announced our second quarter dividend of per share up nearly from a year ago our nimble customercentric businesses provide us the ability to capitalize on emerging trends evident in our results across the past several years and in our sustainable outlook within auto consumer originations of billion represented our highest first quarter in years sourced from million decisioned applications with originated yields once again exceeding despite low levels of inventory and new unit sales consumer originations were up yearoveryear demonstrating the agility and scale of our auto business allowing us to consistently generate volume at attractive risk adjusted returns credit normalization through the first quarter has been in line with expectations and retail ncos of basis points remain well below prepandemic levels we continue monitoring broader market indicators of consumer health including wage and price inflation employment conditions and overall payment trends while the current inflationary environment will add some pressure to households consumers are generally well positioned with healthy balance sheets and as youve heard from us before weve made significant investments in our ability to engage our auto customers through expanded digital channels coupled with enhanced analytics within our servicing teams from an industry production perspective were still seeing low levels of inventory driven by persistent supply chain challenges and strong consumer demand these dynamics continue to result in lower floorplan balances and structural support for used originations and values we saw modest normalization in the first quarter but expect floorplan balances to remain low for quite some time within insurance written premiums of million reflected lower overall inventory levels investment portfolio performance remained strong while weather claims benefited from lower exposure turning to ally bank organic and accelerating growth trends continued retail deposit customers now exceed million expanding yearoveryear and representing our 52nd consecutive quarter of growth retail balances grew to billion and account for nearly of our funding profile our consumer engagement and product adoption trends remain robust ally home originated billion in the quarter despite the headwind from higher mortgage rates and slowing refinance volume ally invest customer assets grew to billion a yearoveryear increase while accounts expanded and ally lending volume of million more than doubled yearoveryear as we expanded merchant relationships and volume in the healthcare and home improvement verticals ally credit card surpassed billion in loan balances in the quarter and now has over

earnings call 14apr2022 teammates and highly confident in their ability to continue to execute in a rapidly changing environment and with that jenn over to you jennifer a laclair chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jb and good morning everyone ill begin on slide the strength of our financial performance again this quarter reflects our disciplined operating approach and the continued execution against our long term strategic priorities despite ongoing shifts in the broader market the strength of allys auto and digital bank platforms is reflected in our ability to protect and improve our market share grow and diversify our income sources and generate a solid sustainable return our comprehensive product offerings now serve more than million customers with a clear path to ongoing expansion on slide weve provided a few metrics we are watching closely relative to consumer health with over million total customers including over million depositors and over million monthly consumer loan applications we have unique data and insight into ongoing consumer trends and performance the average savings account balance at ally is increased to including a increase in the lower balance accounts and while inflation in particular gas prices impact spending levels and real wage growth our retail auto portfolio has virtually no exposure to consumers most sensitive to higher gas prices weve also included a delinquency snapshot across our loan portfolios increases off the lows remain gradual and overall levels remain well below while key consumer health indicators reflect a strong starting point we expect normalization in the months ahead and well leverage our proprietary data to inform prudent underwriting and servicing strategies lets turn to slide where weve included a snapshot of key measures demonstrating the strength of our balance sheet our funding capital and liquidity remain robust and above prepandemic levels our stable cost efficient deposit portfolio is increased to of total funding up from in  positioning us well in this rising rate cycle while wholesale funding balances have materially declined we maintain access to multiple efficient funding alternatives and improved execution levels as weve earned an investment grade rating in recent years allowance for loan losses of or billion represents over times our reserve level in and approximately million higher than our cecl day requirement our cet1 level remains elevated at which results in approximately billion of excess capital relative to our internal operating target and nearly billion above our scb requirement positioning us well to support accretive customer growth and capital return detailed results for the quarter are on slide net financing revenue excluding oid of billion grew roughly yearoveryear this represents the seventh consecutive quarter of expanding net financing revenue performance in the quarter was driven by strength in auto pricing and origination volume growth in accretive consumer products including our credit card and pointofsale offerings normalization of excess liquidity and proactive hedging activity partially mitigating impacts from shortterm rate increases adjusted other revenue of million reflected strong investment gains and diversified revenues from smartauction insurance and our consumer businesses while our financial outlook assumes mid400 million per quarter we remain opportunistic capturing upside from favorable market conditions provision expense of million reflects robust origination activity and the anticipated gradual normalization of credit performance although trends remain favorable as well cover in a few moments noninterest expense of ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 billion includes seasonal compensation items the first full quarter of credit card operations and investments in business growth brand and technology we expect the yearoveryear expense increase to moderate over the remainder of as the quarter was impacted by certain nonrecurring items excluding the acquisition of fair square we expect full year operating expense growth consistent with prior years and as a reminder fair square is projected to be eps accretive by the end of and to drive positive operating leverage in gaap and adjusted eps for the quarter were and respectively moving to slide net interest margin excluding oid of expanded basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points yearoveryear reflecting significant and sustained improvement overall margin expansion reflects the structurally enhanced balance sheet we have built over several years earning asset yield of grew basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points yearoveryear reflecting the same nii drivers i just mentioned due to strong auto demand we continue to see elevated prepayment activity in retail auto driving a linked quarter decline in the portfolio yield the originated yield exceeded again this quarter and we still expect the portfolio to move closer to originated yield over time especially as prepayment activity normalizes with used car pricing while prepayment activity presents a headwind to retail portfolio yields we have natural offsets as higher vehicle values benefit lease residuals and loss severity looking forward we expect earning asset yield expansion driven by the strength of our market position disciplined pricing especially as rates increase and organic growth across our newer consumer portfolios turning to liabilities cost of funds declined basis points the 11th consecutive quarteroverquarter decline and basis points yearoveryear reflecting the multiyear transformation of our funding profile the differentiated value proposition of ally bank is evident in the growth of our deposit portfolio and the stickiness of our customer base over a wide variety of interest rate and operating environments and while we constantly evaluate competitive dynamics we expect overall deposit rate paid relative to fed funds will be favorable to the prior tightening cycle the growth and strength of our businesses on both sides of the balance sheet will support a strong net interest margin and net interest income expansion from here turning to slide our cet1 ratio declined modestly to as strong earnings supported robust loan growth and nearly million in share repurchases yesterday we announced a dividend of per share and we remain on track execute our billion buyback program reflected of allys strong capital levels and earnings trajectory we recently submitted our ccar results which we believe confirm the strength of our capital position in a severe stress and support our cet1 internal target on the bottom of the slide shares outstanding have declined since we resumed share repurchases in and since the inception of our buyback program in capital deployment priorities remain centered around investing in the growth of our businesses delivering innovative and differentiated products and driving longterm shareholder value on slide asset quality remain strong results reflect a gradual and expected normalization across our consumer portfolios and continuation of historically low losses in our commercial portfolios consolidated net chargeoffs of basis points moved up by basis points yearoveryear retail auto portfolio performance reflected solid consumer payment trends and favorable loss given default rates supported by strong vehicle collateral values in the bottom right delinquencies have increased as expected which will drive higher net ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 chargeoff activity over time we continue to expect gradual normalization to to nco level in the medium term with the expectation of or less in on slide consolidated coverage declined basis points to retail auto coverage of declined basis points but remains basis points higher than cecl day levels our baseline forecast assumes gradually improving unemployment ending the year at approximately before reverting to a historical mean of under our cecl methodology as part of our reserving process we consider a range of potential scenarios including recession stagflation and protracted geopolitical conflicts as discussed we evaluate consumer health real time including rapidly rising inflationary impacts and real wage growth we remain confident our reserves are appropriate for a variety of economic environments including potential but unexpected downside scenarios on slide total deposits remained at billion as retail balanced growth offset the roll down of brokered deposits retail balances increased billion quarteroverquarter even as seasonal tax payment activity was elevated in march our portfolio includes significant balances from affluent depositors generally more susceptible to tax liability outflows due to the financial strength of our customers we would expect tax payment outflows to be elevated in  temporarily pressuring deposit growth we added another customers our 52nd consecutive quarter of customer growth exceeding million overall our customer loyalty and engagement are reflected in industryleading and consistent retention of and multirelationship expansion for the 17th consecutive quarter ending at on slide we have included a chart that shows the stable nature of our growing deposit portfolio since the launch of ally bank in every single annual vintage of deposit customers has grown their balances over time reflecting more than years of continuous growth over this time weve made substantial investments in the ally brand and product capabilities the powerful combination of industry leading customer service expanding digital products and tools and competitive rates differentiates us from our competition and gives us confidence in our ability to remain disciplined as we navigate a rising interest rate environment turning to slide we continue to drive scale and diversification across all our digital bank platforms deposits serve as a gateway to our other banking products including ally lending card invest and mortgage which enhance brand loyalty drive engagement and deepen customer relationships a significant portion of ally invest account openings and ally home directtoconsumer volume is sourced from existing depositors lowering acquisition costs and accelerating organic growth and balance sheet diversification we also see a clear path for expansion among our newer pointofsale lending and credit card products our focus on delivering digital first integrated capabilities supports our outlook for growth and accretive returns in the years ahead lets turn to slide to review auto segment highlights pretax income of million was driven by expanded net financing revenue sourced from strong originations and solid credit performance starting at the bottom left the originated yield again exceeded which we expect for the fifth consecutive year in consumer demand for auto remains robust reflecting the high utility of the auto asset class and driving strong used vehicle values with low inventory and robust used car pricing consumers are accelerating tradeins resulting in elevated prepayment expense impacting the portfolio yield by approximately basis points as inventory grows over time we expect this activity to normalize driving yields above before any benefit from rate increases ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 on the bottom right weve included lease gain trends lease gains were robust in the quarter driven by used vehicle dynamics but as weve discussed for some time the upside remains muted as approximately of the units terminated were purchased by lessees and dealers this is another trend that will gradually normalize as inventory levels increase and used values decline we expect fewer lessee and dealer buyouts which should be another positive for ally over the medium term so while strong used car values have been a benefit to results to date there is a natural hedge to normalization including higher retail auto yields favorable offlease vehicle dynamics and increased floorplan balances turning to slide our leading agile platform is built to adapt to dealer and customer needs in a comprehensive and innovative manner reflected in our performance and the multiyear growth of our dealers our focus continues to migrate towards deepening these relationships driving strong application trends which we expect to exceed million again this year in the upper right ph ending consumer assets expanded to billion up on a yearoveryear basis we expect to see a robust market that is supportive of our outlook for billion to billion of consumer originations in commercial balances ended at billion reflecting a gradual and modest normalization of inventories turning to origination trends on the bottom half of the page auto volume of billion up from prior year represents our highest first quarter in over a decade we provide a broad access to credit for consumers utilizing our full spectrum underwriting capabilities while maintaining consistent fico and nonprime trends turning to insurance results on slide core pretax income of million decreased yearoveryear driven by the impact of lower industry sales dealer inventories and record investment gains in the prior year period robust investment income of million reflected our ability to drive gains opportunistically in volatile markets on a yearoveryear basis underwriting income declined million as favorable loss performance was offset by lower pc premium total written premiums of million reflected lower unit sales and inventory levels across the industry within ally we see significant opportunity to improve dealer penetration and grow this highly accretive business and we are excited to have daniel eller our former investor relations executive in his new role leading this business turning to corporate finance on slide core income of million reflected expanding net financing revenue driven by disciplined growth in the portfolio strong other revenue from investment gains syndication income and growth in unused commitment fees and stable credit trends the loan portfolio remains diversified across industries and its floating rate which positions us well for expected rate increases the quality of our portfolio is evident in our consistent credit performance and asset based loans comprising of the portfolio our billion hfi balance is up yearoveryear reflecting our strong expertise and disciplined growth within a highly competitive market mortgage details are on slide mortgage generated pretax income of million reflecting tighter margins on conforming production and reduced demand for refinancing activities ally home dtc originations of billion was relatively flat on a yearoveryear basis but down linked quarter given the contraction in the overall mortgage market mortgage remains a critical product for our customers who value a modernized and seamless digital platform we added four new states to our platform this quarter now active in plus dc we are prioritizing a strong experience for our bank customers and enhanced risk adjusted returns which may lead to changing origination levels in any given quarter or year ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 on slide weve again included our financial outlook considering the rapidly evolving operating environment since we provided guidance in january weve seen accelerating geopolitical conflict increased inflationary pressure and a significant move in rates as the market expectation for fed funds has increased over basis points since our january update a key watch item as we manage pricing on both sides of the balance sheet despite that volatility were confident in allys ability to generate a to plus return over the medium term with the expectation will be at the high end of that range performance will be fueled by strong revenue growth annual ppnr expansion and normalizing used vehicle value and credit performance our outlook embeds balanced competitive and operating environment assumption specifically in auto and deposits the earnings and return profile of the company has structurally improved and we remain focused on driving near and longterm benefits for all of our stakeholders and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you jenn ill close with a few comments on slide number first i remain deeply grateful and proud to lead our company our results this quarter are impressive our broader objective to serve our teammates our customers our communities and our stockholders is what defines our companys longterm success weve built a structurally enhanced more profitable company through strategic execution across our business lines balance sheet optimization over many years and differentiated products for our customers all of which positions us for a very strong longterm outlook we will continue to execute with a focus on the same values and priorities that have served us well over several years and with that jenn sean back to you jennifer a laclair chief financial officer ally financial inc okay jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc and we can go into qa sean leary headinvestor relations ally financial inc thank you jb as we head into qa we do ask that participants limit yourself to one question and one followup livia please begin the qa ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question coming from the line of bill carcache from wolfe research your line is open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning jb and jenn jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hey good morning bill jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc good morning hi i wanted to dig into the impact of used car prices a bit more in your outlook youve said that youre assuming to decrease between and the end of but thats an average correct and just to clarify where do you expect used car prices to be at the end of relative to levels jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure thank you bill very important question as weve seen very elevated used car prices even coming into the guide that we have provided is a minus to on average for so if you think about the point to point decline from first quarter to fourth quarter of its obviously significantly larger than that so keep that in mind its sequential and its a steep drop off now i do think the dynamics around used car pricing is really important as you look at the total earning asset yield and income statement for ally as we would see used car pricing come down we would expect to see tailwinds in our retail loan portfolio yield as i mentioned elevated prepayment activity has created about a basis point drag on retail auto portfolio yields even within the lease business as wed expect used vehicle values to come down lbo and dbo should normalize and that should give us access to more gains just even within lease and then last but not least we are expecting inventory to come up as used vehicle values come down and that should create more growth in a floating rate asset as we head into a rising rate environment so a lot of just natural hedges around used vehicle values and i think ally really wins either way if used vehicle values remain robust well see elevated contract values strong originations strong lease yields lower lgd if it moderates down youre going to see a lot of tailwind in commercial floorplan as well as retail auto yields and i think from a credit perspective weve been pricing appropriately for lgd we have reserves qualitatively and quantitatively to cover and its certainly included in our to guide as well so hopefully that gives you some color bill its really important to look at this holistically across ally ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood maybe just following up on that so is it reasonable to conclude based on everything that as you explained it jenn that that to nco rate in your outlook for to it reflects and all the other moving parts associated with used vehicle prices if they were to decline to levels that you have confidence that the outlook that you laid out contemplates the achievability of the numbers that youve laid out if used vehicle prices were to normalize back to levels jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean in the guide just to be really clear we have that to average annual decrease and that would flow through all of our yields as well as into our assumptions around ncos and just keep in mind we also have qualitative factors and weve been very mindful of the uncertainty in the operating environment the elevated contract values that were originating against and like i said were pricing sufficiently for that and guiding towards it in that nco guide as well as establishing qualitative and quantitative reserves around that so i think were very well covered in the guide bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc okay its just that theres i think lack of confidence of the improvement that ally has seen in its earnings growth and rotce postcovid is sustainable and youve laid out clearly that there are structural reasons for the improvement but i think that that just helps get at the sustainability question even if you did have sharper normalization in used car prices thanks for taking my questions jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc of course thank you bill and i think thats a really important point and also as jb always tells us there is a bull case around used vehicle pricing if you think about inventory levels and continued supply chain constraints i think the guide that weve provided is pretty conservative relative to what were actually experiencing across our dealers today jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah i mean to that point even we talked to some of our big dealers i mean theyre again they continue to be another quarter in and theyre pretty sold four five six months out of everything they have coming in on production so its a pretty fascinating dynamic that were seeing right now but great questions bill obviously youre seeing us lay into the sustainability story here we feel really confident but we got a great outlook and really strong position for the future operator and our next question coming from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning jb good morning jenn ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning ryan jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so maybe just to start on the net interest margin so jenn you reiterated an upper nim which also factoring additional basis points of rate hikes could you maybe just unpack for us whats included in there in terms of asset repricing and more importantly deposit betas and then second can you maybe just talk about how you expect betas to progress over lets say the first to basis points relative to the second basis points and how are you expecting the pricing strategy to differ and what gives you the confidence that its going to be favorable relative to last time then i have a followup jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure so let me start first ryan on the asset yield and i just hit on some of the dynamics there but starting with retail loans were continuing to see robust originations well have our fifth year of putting new originations on the books at over and as we would expect used vehicle values to come down wed expect a really nice tailwind on lower prepayments in our retail loan portfolio and then even in lease as inventory returns we should see growth there and just its important that we have this natural hedge with used vehicle values coming down lbo and dbo dynamics should shift with that and help to neutralize some of the decrease from lower vehicle values and then of course we would see inventory levels coming up i mentioned floorplan floating rate as rates come up well be growing that portfolio at the right time we also have a better mix dynamic as weve run off excess cash were also growing our unsecured products so think about ally lending and ally card at very healthy yield so all in ryan we would expect our earning asset yield to continue to expand well into the and thats with a rising rate environment but even absent that with the favorable mix that well have and noteworthy is and we talk about this a lot the originated yield on retail auto relative to the portfolio just even through april year todate weve been able to put pricing in the market in fact weve added about basis points of price so far and thats as you know way out ahead of fed fund increases so feel really good about the earning asset yield expansion and the growth attached to that as well and then on the liability side look we are in such a different place today than we were in the past especially in and the last rising rate cycle if you think about were almost core funded were investment grade we have access to alternative funding sources and quite frankly weve continued to invest in a very competitive value proposition around digital tools brand the multiproduct relationships that weve been building the consistent retention that weve driven and so we feel great from a consumer value perspective as well as from an ally balance sheet perspective that well be able to hold rate at a lower level relative to fed funds in this next rising rate cycle now i mean i know ryan weve gone back and forth a lot on beta math and as you know were starting at a significantly lower pricing position this time around and so beta could we run scenarios where beta could potentially be a little higher but i ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 think whats important is even when we run those scenarios were still seeing a path to that upper nim thats supporting our to plus rotce guide so hopefully that gives you a bit of color ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah no thats helpful and maybe if i can ask a followup a twopart question so jb when we met in december you talked about the franchise being able to generate to a share of earnings but obviously the world has changed a bit in the past few months but i was just wondering if you could talk about how you expect earnings to progress as the cycle progresses do you still feel comfortable outside of a recession can we see those type of earnings and what are the drivers and then second jenn you mentioned on the call that earnings have structurally improved and when i talk to investors they do struggle to understand what took us from kind of to prepandemic to to postpandemic so can you maybe just talk about what are the main drivers that should make profitability structurally higher and why you think they are sustainable thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc jenn jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc do you want me to by the way ryan i think youre on question four or five but thats all right jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc do you want to get started jenn i think jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc i think these are very much connected and the key drivers as we continue to reiterate is just in retail lending we have changed our focus from subvented super prime paper to prime youve seen our market position and the continued performance weve had in retail auto and that just generates a higher earnings trajectory as well as a higher return on tangible common equity so just the mix shift inside the four walls of auto has been very powerful and then i mean look weve added a lot of new product capabilities which are accelerating we shared the numbers around ally lending as well as ally card obviously ally card is a roa product driving very significant and accretive returns ally lending as well and so the growth of our newer product is really helping to propel our earnings trajectory and the guide towards the to 18pluspercent return on tangible common equity and then we cant underestimate the power of our liability stack and youve been out there saying ally has transformed the liability stack more so than any other bank out there and we agree with that and that is a big part of our structural improvement in our profitability and hey if you want to point investors to our track record look at our return on tangible common equity hit we just printed over i can see ryan this year getting to plus or minus and then we have a very healthy guide of to 18pluspercent ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 so weve got a great track record i think we have a very reasonable set of assumptions going into the future and to plus return is very healthy because of all those dynamics jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc well covered ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks jenn and no followup jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you ryan jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks ryan jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc we appreciate your good indiscernible jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc i just told you were not coming off of what i told you in december so yeah all good jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks operator and our next question coming from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning obviously you guys alluded to the fact that people are getting jittery about consumer credit and i appreciate the color you provided on slide on how its affecting your portfolio but im curious how its affecting your underwritings and the decisions that youre making going forward do you guys envision it to impact any of your loan growth expectations especially on the unsecured credit side ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah good morning sanjay so the way that our underwriting strategy is positioned is really to look through the cycle and so were not making big shifts based on macroeconomic forecasts that we know will not be perfectly correct or even remotely correct in some circumstances so our position on underwriting has always been to look through returns through the cycle weve largely done that in retail auto i will say we make some tweaks around the edges we are seeing elevated contract values and so were mindful of potential lgd impact down the road and so weve put additional pricing in to cover off on lgd weve also been mindful of that as weve established quantitative and qualitative reserves around the portfolio so we do make tweaks around the edges i think that we are incredibly wellpositioned as we think about both the pricing and the reserving that we have and then on the unsecured side very similar approach that were taking and i shared a slide in the presentation just around the data that were looking at and that will help us to make tweaks as well again its not going to be a wholesale change in our underwriting but we will be mindful of that making tweaks and then underwriting is important but servicing as well and as we see any kind of deterioration or we see delinquencies pick up in pockets over time will be able to be incredibly proactive from a servicing perspective as well and i just noted in response to ryans question that weve been mindful of this environment and weve been taking pricing up in retail auto by way of example weve increased pricing a couple of times and its about basis points just yeartodate through april here sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and just to follow up on some color on the reserves expectations i know jenn you sort of went through some of the comparisons relative to cecl day just on the qualitative side if we compare today versus cecl day whats the difference in the qualitative assumptions given how the markets or the investment community is sort of position and the macro is considering deterioration from here thanks jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure i mean look as we came through the pandemic we had qualitative reserves around covid and as weve headed into weve again considered qualitative factors especially relative to inflation recession probability and in particular in retail auto have established some qualitative reserve factors there so overall from a quantitative and a qualitative perspective i think retail auto is up some basis points from day cecl so we think were in a really good position there and then as ive continued to note we essentially have a recession built into our assumptions on our reserves if you think about after year three unemployment rate hit so for all those reasons sanjay and i think what youre pointing to we have a really robust reserve and really strong balance sheet as we enter and continue to navigate an unbelievable amount of uncertainty thank you sanjay operator and our next question coming from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 q hey good morning this is ph jeff patterson on for betsy jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc hi ph jeff morning jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hi good morning q good morning jb and jenn it seems like youre perhaps suggesting some nim upside from here just given all the benefits youve talked about coming through today on the earning asset yield side over time as used car prices normalize and i know were already sitting here today at nim and youre sticking to the upper guide just want to understand how youre thinking about the probability of going higher from here or how much conservatism is embedded in the guide and then on the slide you did mention youre monitoring the shape of the yield curve can you just remind us what youre embedding in your expectations right now on the yield curve and maybe how much of an impact inversion has for indiscernible jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah and let me just start with the assumption around the yield curve so were now expecting fed funds forwards to hit about at year end and then migrating up to about early and against that we are expecting kind of through time to continue to hit that upper nim i will say it could bounce around a little bit from quartertoquarter as we continue to have low deposit pricing and asset yield expansion kind of early but then as deposit pricing picks up in some of the later quarters you could have nim bounce around quite frankly over the next kind of six eight quarters but i think whats important is that we still see a clear path to that sustainable higher nim simply because of the structural improvements we have on both sides of the balance sheet so hopefully that helps in terms of just the nim from an inversion perspective thats something were watching very carefully and were not putting a lot of duration on the books right now weve been mindful of kind of adding to our securities portfolio as i talked about in mortgage were being really selective about what we put into hfi just to make sure that we do manage duration and potentially ahead of an inversion and the other watch item and i mentioned this in my prepared remarks is simply making sure were disciplined and diligent around deposit pricing q got it thats helpful and just as a quick followup im not sure if i missed this already but just wanted to understand in the back of the slide deck why the interest sensitivity profile seemed to have been more impacted in the basis up scenario for the instantaneous rate scenario ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah well i mean you have to look at the underlying assumptions as we move from fourth quarter to first quarter keep in mind our forward assumption also increased basis points so this is basis points on a basis point assumption and so youre talking about a very very steep shock relative to even where we were in the fourth quarter of now as ive talked about in the past we have hedging activity that helps to mitigate part of that very steep ramp up in interest rates but essentially its just the pull forward of basis points on fed fund forwards q thanks jenn jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you operator and our next question coming from the line of moshe orenbuch with credit suisse your line is open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks i think the wanted to talk a little bit about the originations level and the yield and the pricing comments that you made i guess pretty remarkable just given that some of the large banks that have reported have not been nearly as robust like what do you see is driving that specifically is it a competitive advantage versus some of the competitors that are wholesale funded like can you talk a little bit about what has given you that is it some of the partnerships just talk about that and how it relates to both the volume and pricing jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure moshe and i think it relates to just our overall strategy in auto which is to focus on the prime segment i think super prime has been impacted simply because of vehicle availability moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc right jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc where were underwriting in prime and in particular at the intersection of used and prime theres still a terrific amount of transaction volume and some of thats driving churn in the portfolio but there is a terrific amount of demand still in the system thats driving transactions and driving originations for us i mean as we take kind of a step back we think there is some million million customers that are on the sideline right now just because they cannot find a vehicle to purchase and so not only are we expecting this very strong origination volume to continue this year wed expect it in the future ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 and there could be some mix shift for more new as it becomes available versus the used and the new but its related to our segment its related to our scale our relationships were at well over continue to grow were driving app flow through those dealer relationships and so moshe its really all of the above its the very important segment were in prime and used and its obviously the capabilities that were bringing to that segment that has continued to fuel just very accretive originations for years moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it thanks and maybe kind of to follow up on one of ryans questions you talked about the natural hedges in terms of the earnings outlook and things that could help mitigate whatever whether its the normalization of used car values or rising rates and the like are there any kind of active steps that youre taking that you would add to that like things that youre doing kind of you mentioned obviously pricing but are there other things that the company is doing to kind of position for the rest of and jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean look were not complacent on anything i mean were very focused on continuing to serve all of our customers starting first with the dealers making sure were there to support originations weve continued to expand not only our traditional dealers but our newer dealers carvana echopark a number of the newer entrants and were not getting complacent at all continuing to drive that engagement and that application flow were also mindful of dynamics around consumer health and so were monitoring that very closely i included that extra slide this morning to give you a sense for how closely were monitoring the data to inform as you pointed out moshe pricing but also servicing strategies i mean we are expecting delinquencies to continue to normalize chargeoffs to continue to normalize and weve continued to invest heavily in human capital technology and digital capabilities in the servicing side of the house as well and then i think your point on hedges is really important and as i pointed out earlier well theres a lot of headlines around used vehicle pricing coming down continuing to see offsets to that whether its the lbo dbo dynamics whether thats increase in inventory that well see in the floorplan book or even continued origination unit opportunities that we would expect to grow from here if used vehicle values come down so again moshe its continuing to do a lot of what weve been doing in the past but just monitoring the consumer health and making sure thats in consideration and in originations as well as underwriting strategies moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc jb i dont know if you want to add jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc well covered ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you moshe operator our next question coming from the line of rob wildhack with autonomous research your line is open robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning jb good morning jenn jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hey rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research just wanted to ask on expenses quickly on expenses you said that this year is going to be consistent with past years in terms of expense growth if we dig into that at all do fair square and more credit card or ally lending business change the expense profile such that there are some puts and takes within the business lines there jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah and rob just to clarify i mentioned ally standalone expense trajectory for full year will be similar to what youve seen in the past so that excludes credit card in the ally standalone expenses you expect a lot of the same themes that youve heard me talk about in the past so were scaling our businesses theres variable costs attached to that continuing to invest in technology marketing brand to fuel that growth cybersecurity as well and then credit card i think weve been very clear on our performance expectations rotce accretive day one eps accretive by year end and operating leverage accretive by and as jb hit on and i hit on my prepared remarks we are well underway to hit that guidance and those robust performance expectations from ally card and then just i think it is important to take the big picture in mind we do not manage expenses point in time line item by line item we are investing over time for positive operating leverage and accretive returns and certainly weve been delivering that we had a midteens plus positive operating leverage in we would expect to see operating leverage and ppnr expansion over time but were not managing line item by line item quarter by quarter rob just to clarify robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research got it thanks and then just on the deposit side looking at the rate tables there you guys are still at basis points a lot of your peers havent moved either why do you think thats the case why do you think those havent repriced yet jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 yeah look i mean theres still a lot of liquidity in the system today and i think its going to take some time for loan growth to catchup to excess liquidity available on bank balance sheets i think thats number one i think if you look at the basis points relative to the average across the industry its still competitive and last but not least i think just mindful of the continued capabilities that ally has invested in in terms of digital brand customer service we do think we offer value above and beyond just rate but i think its going to take some time rob quite frankly to see pricing come through we have seen cd prices elevate a bit across the industry youd expect that early in a rising rate cycle as the industry is trying to lock in lower cost funding but not a lot of growth in those products just yet jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research thats very helpful jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you
