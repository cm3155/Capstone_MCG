transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 thank you sean good morning we appreciate you joining us this morning to review our first quarter results ill begin on page number adjusted eps of core rotce of and revenues of billion reflect continued execution across our businesses in a dynamic operating environment net interest margin remained resilient at as a result of disciplined pricing on both sides of our balance sheet originated yields on retail auto averaged for the quarter reflecting our ability to leverage dealer relationships to originate strong risk adjusted returns just the start of the tightening cycle weve added basis points of price into the market implying a beta of nearly while were remaining disciplined on risk content the total portfolio yield will continue to move upward towards newly originated yields which represents a nice tailwind for the foreseeable future while operating results were in line with expectations adjusted eps is below consensus driven by a headwind from valuation adjustments of certain equity investments despite the million impact this quarter these investments have generated accretive returns for ally given the events in our industry that transpired in march we thought it was important to spend additional time highlighting our deposits franchise and overall liquidity position retail deposits finished the quarter up million we also added a record net new deposit customers our retail deposits exceed million of which are insured by the fdic our insured deposit balances increased billion within the quarter in addition to retail deposits we maintain access to multiple other funding sources and currently have total available liquidity of billion for context our liquidity position is times our uninsured deposit balances common equity tier was relatively flat quarteroverquarter at current cet1 exceeds our scb regulatory minimum by billion and we absorbed another year of the cecl phasein operational highlights reflect the strength of our leading franchises within auto finance we decisioned more than million applications in the quarter said another way we evaluated billion in potential originations this quarter and booked billion of loans that met our riskadjusted return hurdles consumer demand remains strong net chargeoffs were basis points results within the quarter were in line with expectations and brad will provide detailed commentary on our credit outlook later within insurance written premiums of million were up meaningfully and reflect continued momentum as we grow and deepen dealer relationships turning to ally bank total deposits of billion were up billion yearoveryear consumer engagement and adoption trends across our other ally bank product offerings remain strong million customers across credit card and pointofsale lending provide opportunities to deepen relationships and diversify our earnings profile corporate finance remains focused on serving customers while delivering strong riskadjusted returns our held forinvestment portfolio of billion was flat quarteroverquarter in terms of credit quality the portfolio is all firstlien positions our cre exposure is limited in size concentrated entirely within the healthcare space and represents approximately of total loans on the balance sheet turning to slide number a strong purposedriven culture is more important now than ever we maintained a consistent focus on culture over the past decade and its fueled significant progress strategically and financially our focus remains on driving longterm value for all stakeholders but that is only made possible by delivering for our employees customers and communities on a daily basis ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 for our employees the first year of our ownit grant program vested providing  of ally stock to those employees who have been with us for the past three years further strengthening the owners mentality we embrace across the organization and im particularly proud of the enhanced benefits weve offered to our associates and their families to help manage mental health for our customers we continue to enhance digital capabilities across our product suite to ensure were offering a seamless customer experience for our communities we continue to advance the equality in womens sports through partnerships like the one announced in february with the walt disney company im more confident than ever that our culture will be a critical differentiator in both the good times and tough times turning to slide number weve highlighted the strength of our consumer deposit franchise over the past years we built a sustainable model focused on doing the right thing for our customers the steady growth for new and existing depositors demonstrates their desire to keep their money at ally and grow with us our customer base is now million strong with growth led by millennial and younger cohorts signaling the continued opportunity ahead our performance throughout the market volatility in march highlights the overall strength of our consumer deposit business of our deposits are insured with the fdic average balances within uninsured deposits are some of the lowest among peers the portfolio in total has an average account balance of approximately and our customercentric approach continues to resonate evidenced by customer retention importantly weve delivered this performance while consistently providing bestinclass technology and customer service and pricing below top rate payers moving to slide number we provide an incremental detail on trends within our retail deposit portfolio the composition of our portfolio and the strength of our brand enabled us to navigate the volatility of the past several weeks with minimal impact looking at the bottom left we had our strongest quarter of net customer acquisition since which is essentially the best quarter in our banks history since weve reached deposit core funding weve been able to focus on growing and deepening customer relationships on the bottom right weve seen a gradual decline in uninsured balances over the past year in total uninsured balances are down billion year overyear but more than offset by billion of insured deposit growth outflows among uninsured accounts were elevated the week of march but were more than offset by strong inflows for new customers during the market volatility the ally brand resonated as a source of strength as they look to diversify their deposit balances across institutions looking ahead i remain confident in our ability to balance growth and pricing given our deposit funding in multiple marketbased alternatives on slide number weve highlighted the depth of our nondeposit funding sources while recent events have highlighted the resiliency of our deposits book we will continue to maintain access to multiple alternative sources of liquidity for risk management and diversification purposes in the case of home loan bank advances or repo agreements we can access more than billion of incremental funding in a matter of hours importantly we found that home loan bank advances in the month of march were executed efficiently despite the elevated activity seen in the industry brokered cds continue to serve as an efficient complement to the retail book and we have access through several firms and across the maturity curve our unsecured debt issuances are investmentgrade and a key source of parent company liquidity based on our current liquidity profile and liquidity risk metrics we dont have to issue any unsecured debt in but we will remain opportunistic depending on market conditions obviously theres been pretty modest big issuance since ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 early march but we expect markets will start to open as stress starts to wane we have a mature securitization platform that is wellknown in the market that we can leverage to match fund retail auto assets weve grown the retail deposits book by almost billion over the past five years which has reduced our need for other funding today we leverage these options more opportunistically allowing us to optimize cost of funds and manage duration i know this is a lot more to cover than normal but given the volatility of the past month we wanted to highlight the significant access we maintain to nondeposit funding moving to slide number we provided a snapshot of our current funding stack and available liquidity again we remain core funded with deposits making up of our funding footprint on the right side we summarized our total available liquidity position of billion which is up nearly in just the last six months in total this liquidity is times uninsured deposit balances we have seen time and time again that liquidity is the single most important factor for a healthy bank we have always prioritized prudent liquidity risk management and well continue to do so going forward obviously it was an interesting quarter but we fared well and im proud of how the team responded we are well positioned from a variety of perspectives and while some of the defensive but prudent actions pressure the next six months of earnings guidance long term we still forecast the impressive return expansion with that ill turn it over to brad to cover our detailed financial results bradley j brown corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jb good morning everyone ill begin on slide net financing revenue excluding oid of billion was down yearoveryear driven by higher funding costs given the rapid increase in shortterm rates largely offset by strengthened auto pricing higher floating rate assets our hedging program and growth in unsecured products adjusted other revenue of million included the million impact from certain equity investments as mentioned by jb underlying momentum continued across our insurance smartauction and consumer banking businesses we continue to see a path for further expansion and remain committed to achieve our target of approximately billion this year provision expense of million reflected the expected increase in chargeoffs and modest reserve build to reflect the evolving macro environment noninterest expense of billion reflects investment in our businesses and in technology we remain focused on diligent expense management and expect the paces of increases to decline in the quarters ahead gaap and adjusted eps for the quarter were and respectively moving to slide net interest margin excluding oid of was in line with expectations and decreased basis points yearoveryear and basis points quarteroverquarter as weve mentioned on prior calls despite underlying momentum on asset pricing the impact of ongoing increases in shortterm rates and the repricing dynamics of our balance sheet creates some nearterm margin pressure our nim thesis is largely unchanged as we still see fullyear nim in the range this year before inflecting higher ill share more detail on nim dynamics shortly our retail auto pricing and origination strategies continue to drive current earning asset yields higher and will generate significant tailwinds in future periods total average loans and leases are up billion versus prior year with more modest growth of billion versus the fourth quarter ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 earning asset yield of grew basis points quarteroverquarter and nearly basis points yearover year reflecting the continuation of trends weve highlighted previously including strong originated yields within retail auto growth in higheryielding assets and over billion of floating rate exposure across the loan and hedging portfolios retail auto portfolio yield expanded basis points from the prior quarter as newer originations continue to comprise a larger portion of the portfolio including the impact of hedges yields reached up basis points quarteroverquarter and we expect yields will migrate toward as we exit commercial portfolio yields continue their expansion given their floating rate nature turning to liabilities cost of funds increased basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points yearover year the increase in deposit costs was in line with expectations shared last quarter and reflects higher benchmark rates and a competitive market for deposits moving to slide we provided some color on our interest rate risk positioning and hedging strategy given the volatility in rates for the past year and how we dynamically position ourselves for a variety of outcomes given our naturally liabilitysensitive position weve leveraged our hedge program to mitigate nearterm nim pressure and to reduce the duration of our afs securities portfolio while we routinely hedged our fixed rate auto assets and securities portfolio newer hedge accounting rules we adopted last year provided incremental flexibility and capacity throughout the first quarter we increased our pay fixed position as rates markets presented opportunities to lock in incremental hedges at attractive rates the increased payfixed position shown on the bottom of the page provides significant protection against a potential higherforlonger scenario which candidly is more our house view on rates effective notional at quarter end was billion and the positive carry on these hedges will generate meaningful nii over the coming year as the retail auto portfolio migrates toward current originated yields putting all of this together we are relatively neutral from a rate risk perspective in the near term but expect to benefit from lower rates over a longer horizon given our core funding to liquid savings deposits slide provides incremental detail on our outlook for margin weve seen modest pressure to our fullyear nim outlook that continue to expect it will be around though we may see quarters slightly below that level this outlook is based on the forward curve as of quarter end which has fed funds peaking at before declining to in december of this year this modest adjustment to nim relative to last quarter is the result of strategic action we felt appropriate given recent events including maintaining higher cash balances and changes to our retail auto origination outlook which is lower than previously expected and higher in the credit spectrum an accelerated rotation in cds as seen across the industry added incremental pressure despite the headwinds underlying operational trends remain resilient and are shown at the bottom of the page strong momentum in auto pricing has ph quartered our expectation for the portfolio yield to hit around as we exit since last year weve added basis points in a targeted fashion and are currently originating loans near on the deposit side pricing has moved in line with expectations shared on last quarters call we expect continued movement in deposit costs as the portfolio fully tracks toward current yields on liquid savings and cd mix continues to increase clearly this is a dynamic environment and there are a range of possible outcomes but we remain confident in our balance sheet posture and corresponding nim trajectory and while there continues to be a lot of focus on the nearterm nim trough we continue to see a steady migration up to over time even without the benefit of rate cuts ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 turning to slide our cet1 ratio was relatively flat given our disciplined approach to capital allocation we announced another quarterly common dividend of per share payable this quarter we are not currently contemplated share repurchases which will be marketdependent and we remain focused on ensuring loan originations across our consumer and commercial portfolios meet our return hurdles at current levels we exceed our regulatory cet1 operating at minimum by billion we phased in another quarter of capital impact from the transition to cecl which was worth basis points this quarter two more phasein periods remain with the total impact fully phased in by the first quarter of we remain focused on maintaining prudent capital levels while investing in our businesses and supporting our customers slide provides detail on aoci and our securities portfolio which currently comprises of average earning assets as a reminder we hold securities as a core part of our overall liquidity position and generally classify them as available for sale which supports our intention to manage the portfolio with a throughthecycle view by maintaining hedging and monetization flexibility unrealized gains and losses of the afs portfolio are included in tangible book value but as a category iv bank we have opted out of including aoci and regulatory capital and are mindful of pro forma cet1 levels the top left of the chart shows pro forma cet1 would be slightly below our fed requirement with a number of important distinctions to make first this impact doesnt contemplate a potential phasein similar to cecl second it doesnt consider any change in rates before implementation of the impact and third it ignores the consistent accretion we will see asset moves in rates and spreads as the securities accrete to par adjusted tangible book value per share at quarterend was up quarteroverquarter and excluding the impact of aoci that figure increases to up since the beginning of the box in the center of the page provides a highlevel summary of the accretion we expect assuming stable rate we see around million of aoci annually which corresponds to approximately basis points of cet1 and more than of book value per share the bottom of the page highlights a few additional aspects of our securities portfolio roughly of the portfolios interest rate risk is hedged via the payfixed swaps we just discussed and the portfolio is comprised primarily of highly liquid securities that can be leveraged to generate federal home loan bank and repo capacity as jb mentioned earlier lets turn to slide to review asset quality trends consolidated net chargeoffs of basis points reflected a combination of indiscernible within retail auto and an increased proportion of higheryielding unsecured consumer assets first quarter net chargeoffs of basis points were largely in line with the guidance we shared last quarter as key drivers of performance largely offset one another in the bottom right 30day delinquencies declined basis points quarteroverquarter typical seasonality was impacted by lower tax refund benefits 60day delinquencies reflected similar trends but also reflect our strategic shift in collection processes to provide more time to work with customers and avoiding repossession which has led to favorable flowtoloss rates we expect increases in delinquencies and continue to monitor the cumulative impact of inflation on consumers and our investments in servicing and collection practices improved our ability to communicate with and support our customers ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 slide shows that consolidated coverage increased basis points to which reflects additional reserve build in the unsecured portfolios the total reserve increased to billion or billion higher than cecl day levels we continue to model a worsening macroeconomic environment with unemployment exceeding under our reversion to historical mean methodology we also contemplate the unique nature of the current environment given largely unprecedented inflationary pressures over the past year retail auto coverage of was flat quarteroverquarter and remains basis points or roughly million higher than cecl day as the remaining indiscernible life of our existing portfolio is slightly less than two years we believe these reserve levels very appropriately cover expected lifetime losses slide highlights the actions weve taken in retail auto across underwriting and pricing given the current environment we now anticipate well originate around billion this year slightly lower than the expectation communicated last quarter but as we always do well continue to refine our appetite for loan growth as we move throughout the year our unique model combining a hightech platform with a hightouch human element continues to serve us well our underwriting and origination strategy is always informed by frontbook vintage performance and the bottom of the page provides some insight into the actions we have taken as you can see our origination mix has skewed toward higher credit tier segments on a yearoveryear basis weve added significant price across the entirety of the credit spectrum but our pricing action has been very targeted the middle of the page illustrates our elevated pricing actions in segments that present higher credit risk most of our first quarter price actions occurred near the end of the quarter limiting their impact on first quarter results but will become more meaningful in the second quarter the bottom right previews how we expect our pricing and underwriting actions to unfold over the coming months and impact second quarter results we anticipate slightly more superprime volume as weve modestly reduced pricing within that space we remain competitive at the intersection of prime and used where weve been able to generate our strongest volume and solid riskadjusted returns while adding considerable price in the lower credit tiers weve continued to increase our selectivity as well as our risk pricing premium we see the impact of our recent pricing actions already taking shape with superprime or ph sp loans accounting for of originations in the past couple weeks we continue to see attractive opportunities in the market and we remain a consistent partner for our dealers while being extremely disciplined in the current environment on slide we show our latest view on used vehicle values given yeartodate trends we maintain a cautious outlook for the entirety of despite the increase yeartodate consumer demand had been strong to start the year but given the dynamic macro environment we feel its prudent to remain balanced the bottom of the page highlights this along with what has unfolded so far and our current outlook for our guide in january assumes a decline in values this year given yeartodate performance our base case now assumes a decline on a full year basis or a decline from current values beyond the ongoing lack of quality used vehicle supply is expected to keep auction prices above prepandemic levels slide includes the latest in our retail auto net chargeoff outlook first quarter losses of were in line with our guide as favorable used values were offset by elevated loss frequency a variety of factors will continue to influence performance throughout the year including used vehicle values front book performance ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 delinquencies flowtoloss rates and the denominator impact of lower origination volumes the timing actions weve taken will drive future performance and primarily impact net chargeoff rates beyond the bottom half of the page frames up some of the tailwinds and headwinds relevant to performance as we continue to navigate the current environment as just discussed although weve updated our used values outlook for we remain conservatively postured relative to some industry forecasts keep in mind a change in used values in isolation is worth approximately basis points of net chargeoffs flowtoloss rates remain favorable versus prepandemic levels given the strategic actions weve taken across servicing and collections which include increased digital outreach and repo timing updates delinquency rates were elevated in first quarter versus our expectations and do present a headwind we observed a smaller benefit from tax refunds than in prior years and without continued flowtoloss favorability elevated delinquencies pose risk to future defaults additionally the macro environment continues to pressure consumers we currently expect unemployment to peak around but are equally mindful of the ongoing impact of inflation so netnet no change in the outlook at this time moving to ally bank in slide retail deposits of billion increased million quarteroverquarter reflecting the resilience and strength of our leading alldigital franchise total deposit balances of billion increased billion yearoveryear we delivered record customer growth adding new customers in the first quarter our 56th consecutive quarter of growth given where we are in the tightening cycle weve begun to see an increased consumer appetite for time deposits the bottom left shows our retail deposit mix where retail cd composition increased percentage points quarter overquarter we do expect this migration to continue for the next couple quarters though the rate of change should slow the new cd volume weve observed has been concentrated in the and 18month products turning to slide we continue to drive scale and diversification across our digital bank platforms and maintain a balanced approach to loan growth given the environment ally invest remains a nice complement to our deposit platform and of new account openings were from existing ally bank customers the million customers across card and lending provide further opportunities ahead we will remain disciplined in underwriting which will temper nearterm growth but remain confident in the outlook for these businesses over time lets turn to slide to review auto segment highlights pretax income of million was a result of continued pricing actions offset by higher provision looking at the bottom left originated retail auto yield of was up basis points from the prior quarter reflecting significant pricing actions as mentioned previously we put basis points of price into the market since last year and are continuing to see solid flows with originated yields near the bottom right shows lease portfolio trends where average gain per unit has continued to perform well dealer and lessee buyouts declined further to while we also benefited from stronger than anticipated used values turning to slide we continue to realize the benefits of our leading agile platform underpinned by a hightech and hightouch model consistent application flow shown in the top left enables us to be selective in what we approve and ultimately originate first quarter results showed a further decline in approvals now in the upper right ending consumer assets of billion were flat quarteroverquarter commercial balances ended at billion as new vehicle supply gradually normalizes but used supply remains constrained ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 turning to origination trends on the bottom half of the page consumer auto volume of billion demonstrates our ability to add price in the market while maintaining solid origination volume putting us on track to originate around billion this year lastly used accounted for of originations in the quarter as we enter the typical used vehicle selling season nonprime volume of is slightly below prepandemic trends turning to insurance results in slide core pretax income of million decreased million yearoveryear driven by elevated investment gains in the prioryear period total written premiums were million up yearoveryear reflecting higher dealer inventory and growth in other dealer products this should be a nice tailwind to earned premium over time first quarter results were impacted by severe weather events which resulted in million of weather losses including million incurred during the last week of march going forward we remain focused on leveraging our significant dealer network and holistic offerings to drive further integration of insurance across our existing auto finance dealer base turning to corporate finance on slide core pretax income of million reflected growth in the loan portfolio and favorable syndication and fee income net financing revenue was driven by higher asset balances as well as higher benchmarks as the entire portfolio is floating rate the loan portfolio continues to be highly diversified across industries with assetbased loans comprising of the portfolio and at firstlien position in virtually commercial real estate exposure makes up about billion which is less than of allys consolidated loan book and is entirely related to the health care industry which we think will continue to perform well our billion hfi portfolio is up yearoveryear or relatively flat quarteronquarter as the team leverages their expertise to navigate a highly competitive market and a disciplined approach to growth mortgage details are on slide mortgage generated pretax income of million and million in directto consumer originations reflecting current market conditions we remain focused on a great experience for our customers but refrain from any specific volume targets before closing ill share a few thoughts on the outlook for slide contains our financial outlook as we see it today last quarter we provided our thoughts on earnings trajectory for and beyond as i noted during that call the dynamic environment makes it harder than ever to provide granular guidance and events in the past three months have only heightened that difficulty but we remain committed to transparency based on what we know today we see adjusted eps closer to in relative to the roughly we shared in january we still anticipate ph nim earnings but the outlook has ticked down by approximately basis points or about per share the decline is due to factors covered in depth already including higher cd rotation higher cash balances and lower retail auto originations additionally the guide last quarter did not contemplate the activity on certain equity investments discussed previously this drove another of unfavorability the right side of the page list the detailed assumptions embedded in our current outlook notably all of these ranges are consistent with the january guide but a modestly lower revenue outlook results in slightly lower eps last quarter we provided a framework to think about earnings expansion beyond while we havent included a specific eps figure for we continue to expect earnings growth the ultimate timing of that expansion will be the result of multiple variables including interest rates liquidity and capital levels and origination strategies however we feel strongly in the margin tailwind embedded in the balance sheet today we ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 put loans at and now above for several quarters this will create asset yield expansion in an environment where deposit pricing has stabilized or is potentially declining so consistent with my message last quarter earnings expansion over the next several years will occur as nim moves past the trough and migrates back toward we think that migration occurs under the forward curve or a more conservative scenario where rates remain elevated for the next year or more which underscores the power of our balance sheet and pricing approach over the past year we continue to view midteens as the return profile of the company based on all the structural enhancements weve made over the past several years and remain confident in our ability to continue to execute and drive longterm profitability we acknowledge that will continue to be a dynamic year given macroeconomic headwinds and volatility importantly no one should take the removal of the outer period outlook as a fundamental shift in guidance the company will migrate toward that per share outlook but obviously several moving pieces at the moment may impact the pace in which we get there and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you brad i want to close by reiterating the strategic priorities that guide everything we do first and foremost is ensuring we maintain strong alignment between our culture and all stakeholders were focused on highlighting the differentiated offerings across our businesses for both consumer and commercial customers well continue finding ways to disrupt the industry and remove friction for customers by delivering leading digital experiences and even more important in this dynamic environment is our disciplined approach to risk management and capital allocation i remain incredibly proud to lead our company and over time im confident these priorities will serve us well and deliver value for all stakeholders and with that sean back to you and into qa sean leary headinvestor relations enterprise financial planning and analysis ally financial inc thank you jb as we head into qa we do ask that participants limit yourself to one question and one follow up carmen please begin the qa ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions all right and we have our first question from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw please proceed sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i appreciate that yeah can you guys hear me jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yes got you bradley j brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc got you good morning sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right sorry about that good morning how are you see i appreciate that theres a lot of things in flux and its sort of hard to predict but maybe just a question first on credit and your expectations i know theres a lot of puts and takes that you guys outlined on that slide but as we think about the reserve rate do we feel like going forward there should be modest changes to the reserve rate from here all else equal in this kind of reserve to growth or maybe you could just talk about that in general bradley j brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc yes good morning sanjay its brad yeah absolutely i guess a couple things i would highlight first retail auto is the big driver there you saw that coverage stay the same here this quarter we really dont see at this point any significant drivers of increase going forward in that product away from that you did see a slight build for some of the unsecured consumer assets and so that did drive a bit that was just basis points you saw this quarter and as you mentioned i mean the uncertainty is certainly more than ever but given a lot of the dynamics weve talked about two things one we feel really good about our riskadjusted approach in terms of capital allocation and what were putting on the books today from an overall risk management perspective and then ultimately we really do think it does make sense to really retain this conservative posture around capital just given the uncertainty both economically in the macros but also the dynamics around just potential regulatory response to the early turmoil we saw in early march i should say and then lastly its really about growth right and so from a balance sheet perspective we dont really have significant asset growth in the forecast of course that is a driver in terms of potential increases in build as well but again coming back to the risk management approach and our actions theyre tactically be even more ph conservatively postured going forward we feel good about where we are and what the outlook entails ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and maybe just to follow up on the greater superprime mix understandably youre seeing growth because youve sort of pulled back on rates can you just talk about the competitive backdrop there and sort of what drove that and where thats coming from and if we might see that work its way into prime i guess that would be a little bit of a risk maybe jb you could talk about that and just a followon to that how does that then play into credit quality does that start affecting it positively and then we could have some more positive implications to the provision thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc sure so sanjay ill start and then brad obviously feel free to dive in i mean i think we look at the shift into greater superprime right now as pretty modest overall sanjay i dont think its going to be all that big of a driver right now i mean the market continues to stay pretty competitive but i would say weve seen some bigger names kind of dial back and step back on the retail front obviously there was a bigger announcement that was out there about one of the other competitors stepping back from commercial lending they werent really a huge player like we were so the markets still competitive we think this was just about trimming risk on the edges wanting to have a slightly more conservative posture as again back to this theme theres a lot of uncertainty thats out there but i think this intersection of prime and used is still the space we like to play its still a very big market and i would expect thats where youre going to see the vast majority of our originations going forward i mean to start april the markets probably moved a hair more into the superprime space were taking advantage of that but i dont think its going to be a big driver of change in nim guidance or any change in credit guidance going forward bradley j brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc and maybe ill add a little bit just in terms of as others pull back there is more opportunities for us and ph looks at volume and i think jb really framed that up well in terms of the vast nature of the industry and really how we probably have the best look out there and we can really pick the spots where we see the most value in terms of the credit impact of that i would say we guided that weve been really micro segment ph analysizing around really the risk management aspects and to that point we will as i said in prepared comments we will see an impact of that as those actions take hold but certainly all of that is embedded in our expectations and what weve guided jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc and sanjay maybe one last point i think maybe the only slight pivot this time is we probably would have told you we would have been billion to billion billion of origination flow i think our outlook now is probably more in the billion to billion just as we trim risk on the edges i mean some of that is factored in obviously with the guide the timing all these things that brad talked about but to the extent you get better market clarity we see the consumer continuing to perform you see losses in line and as you said there are a lot of puts and takes and that was part of the reason we put the enhanced disclosure in there on page just to give some sensitivity of the different variables ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 but thats maybe the one were watching again if you see stronger considering their strength continue you see dq sort of slow down a bit we may lean back into originating it a little bit more but right now i think our house view is we trimmed billion billion of originations out of the outlook sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc you got it thanks operator okay one moment for our next question please and it comes from the line of rick shane with jpmorgan please proceed richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks guys for taking my questions this morning so when you talk about migration upwards in terms of credit quality my expectation is that wont really have much impact in in terms of your target loss rate but when we think about the prior guidance of a nco rate are you sort of solving back to that and how do we think about the interplay between solving towards that nco rate and the nim and sort of being on the efficient frontier in terms of margin bradley j brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc yes hey good morning rick so i guess overall in terms of when we kind of think about the guidance further out we were pretty prescriptive last quarter around the trajectory we see through this year and then ultimately what we were looking at in as well i dont think those theses have changed really at all to jbs point around really trimming some of the origination expectations around some of these tightening underwriting aspects marginally i think will be helpful we also have though the dynamic we highlighted around some of the challenged vintages from sort of that late early and then so that remains front and center in terms of watching that performance within expectations and that did drive some of that expectation as well and so again we feel good about what we put out there as we talked about a lot there are certainly puts and takes here and when you think about those dynamics around macro that has gotten slightly better at least in the baseline months but we have the strong labor situation with customers that are challenged cost of living is higher and wage growth necessarily hasnt kept up with that so all that to say the theses around those dynamics kind of lead us to still be comfortable with what we set forth previously richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thats helpful and then my followup is a little bit of a nonsequitur but when we hear about things like golf ball and baseballsized hail in the midwest which weve heard reports of as we move through april ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 makes us think about the insurance business can you just provide an update in terms of storm damage quarter todate jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah so rick its jb good morning i think as we said in our prepared remarks unfortunately the last week of march cost us kind of million million so that was more expensive than normal i think as we think through we think thats where weve got big reinsurance coverage that is renewed is in place and so the outlook would be for for that to be sort of covered and protected but obviously we watch a lot of this hail storms they pop up quickly theyre hard to navigate otherwise the dealer body does a great job of moving cars trying to get cars protected in known weather events when you see a weather event come in but unfortunately these hail storms are just hard to predict and it nicked us up in the first quarter and we dont but again the reinsurance coverage is there to protect us this quarter so shouldnt be a big driver richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thanks jb jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc you got it thank you rick operator thank you one moment for our next question please and it comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please proceed ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc good morning ryan bradley j brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc brad a couple of questions on nim i guess one how would beta expectations evolved i guess second where when do you expect the nim to drop and third can you maybe just parse out the comment that you made that you expect the nim to migrate back to the to even in the higher for longer what are some of the drivers that would get you back towards that level thanks and i have a followup ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 bradley j brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc okay yes good morning ryan sure so on beta a couple things and i talked about in the prepared comments as well that certainly pricing and deposits really did proceed within expectations that we talked about on fourth quarter through the first quarter i think looking forward fundamentally we dont really see anything that is changing our outlook at this point we had sort of this throughthecycle upper 70ish percent on liquid savings from a beta perspective and we did call out as well we have seen some rotation into that and month cd product and that is not surprising given where we are in the cycle and customers feeling a bit more confident to try then a little lock in a little bit of term from that perspective but overall liquid savings and portfolio holistically really dont have any significant update or change in expectations on beta regarding nim overall i would say a couple things one is we did experience the pressure that weve talked about right near term certainly that was evident this quarter i would say theres nothing structural that changed there in terms of the guidance that we have out there in that range auto pricing continues to be a huge driver there were putting on a indiscernible that almost do that full year probably at 105plus for full year so again significant tailwinds for this year but ultimately kind of getting into that question two in terms of higher for longer that is going to benefit us now but even more so in the outer periods as deposits slightly stabilize and then ultimately declines just given the repricing dynamics of the balance sheet that we continue to highlight i think as far as trough goes we see that really this year as we said well bounce around that maybe slightly below some quarters and theres just a lot of dynamics there as you well know weve tried to be very transparent around the hedge position that we have and really leveraging the power of the balance sheet to make sure we can mitigate the nearterm pressure that weve talked about and then from an overall fed funds perspective those expectations are all over the place so it makes it probably even more difficult to put something really prescriptive but again confident in that range a trough probably youll see a stepdown this quarter and third quarter as well but again we dont think that below or something like that so overall structurally no shift but some tweaks here including dont forget weve been very conservative from a liquidity posturing perspective protecting ally jb highlighted the importance of liquidity and that does matter our cash balance is at almost billion at end of the quarter so again thats something well be continue to be watching and optimize where we can but i dont think theres anything more important at this point than making sure were liquid and can support our customers through volatility ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and maybe thats one of our exchange questions in a little bit of a different way so youre now jb youre now expecting a little bit lower originations how much of this is really macrooriented concerns versus specific concerns that or behaviors that youre seeing in the market in terms of performance ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 and if i look at some of the comments on slide it seems like even though unemployment is better losses are not so how are you factoring sticky inflation into the forecast and both from an allowance and from a charge off perspective thank you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah i mean brad kind of covered and brad feel free to dive in overall reserve levels and we feel comfortable there i think ryan were closely watching dq trends both 30day and 60day theyre a little higher than wed want to see but importantly flowtoloss has been performing better and the big question is how does that stick do we see consumers have they been able to fully absorb this higher inflation environment and that sort of our outlook is really lets be more conservative in posture to protect the house going forward and if that means we give up a couple billion dollars of originations well do that again to my earlier comments to the extent we start to see dqs perform maybe favorably you start to see more of these tailwinds or reference on that page start to materialize i think wed lean back into originations a little bit more and thats the nice thing i mean i talked about we see billion of paper every quarter you see tightening in approval rates i think they were down to like i mean you can tweak the wheel pretty quickly and get back to higher degrees of flow so to the extent we see a stronger consumer continuing to emerge then that would give us more confidence to lean into originations a little bit more so those are some of the watch items i also think lets be honest there were a lot of changes that transpired from march going forward and capital preservation is certainly on everyones mind and on regulators mind and we think just being prudent building a little bit more excess capital right now is probably a smart thing to do obviously we dont know what regulatory changes may or may not come with respect to capital but we think being a little bit more in preservation mode right now probably makes the most sense and thats obviously factored into the guidance and the outlook and the direction were having with our auto teammates and our broad teammates here at ally ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for the call indiscernible jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc okay thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question please one moment for our next question yes its coming from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hi betsy bradley j brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay one followup and then another question just on the followup side there i know we had the discussion earlier around the outlook for net chargeoffs and i know last quarter you put in the slide deck the trajectory i think expecting that ncos are going to go to this coming quarter and i just wanted to understand take your temperature on how youre feeling about the trajectory that you put in there does that make sense i know youve got the outlook for delinquencies increasing a little bit more than typical but then your actions on repoing and digital outreach having a positive impact so maybe you could just help us understand that trajectory specifically thanks bradley j brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah going back its brad yes you hit it i think we still feel good about that we guided here for the quarter you mentioned most of the critical aspect i think the one piece is used values right and weve been again transparent there in terms of recognizing the outperformance that weve seen so far this year but also remaining cautious and prudent and balanced as we kind of look at that outlook going forward jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah thats betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc maybe the only other little factor just looking at refunds tax refunds been a little slower this year and sometimes that does have a downstream impact to what goes on in your auto customers but i think as brad said based on everything we see today the guidance we gave last quarter for is fully intact and we feel good betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then second question has to do with the securities portfolio i know you spoke earlier about aoci and theres a risk that it has to go into rate cap but thats probably over a phasein period so i understand all that im just wondering do you have any plans to change how youre investing in securities from here on in is there any changes contemplated to composition or duration or do you keep on doing what youve been doing with the securities book thanks ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 bradley j brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc yes hey betsy yes its brad again so yes we as i said we were pretty much ph oifs so given the complexion of our balance sheet you might imagine things like ph hcam was never a big part of our strategies given the nature of our balance sheet and were used to managing liability sensitivity from an overall strategy perspective i would say we just really havent been reinvesting weve been cautious really through the last couple years and growing the portfolio more than anything just around rate volatility that said we are holding reinvestments cash yields right now you felt were building cash and so holistically we just dont really see any significant change in strategy a core part of our liquidity but obviously were going to continue to be balanced around it and well see what happens from here betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you sean leary headinvestor relations enterprise financial planning and analysis ally financial inc great thank you
