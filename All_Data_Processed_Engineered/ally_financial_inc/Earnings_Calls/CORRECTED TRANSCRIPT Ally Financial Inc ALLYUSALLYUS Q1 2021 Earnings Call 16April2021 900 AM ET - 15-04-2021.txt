credit performance remains solid these are powerful examples of our market leading capabilities and ability to execute on our strategic priorities overall demand for new and used vehicles was robust

transition to increase used vehicle demand a trend we expect to continue and while recent credit trends have been positively impacted by stimulus auto consistently ranks near the top of the consumer payment waterfall a trend that has persisted across several cycles reflecting the strong value of the secured asset class turning to slide several years of steady broadbased consumer adoption of digital banking accelerated in as demand increased for personalized experiences delivered seamlessly and instantly as the largest all digital bank in the us ally is uniquely positioned to benefit from this ongoing evolution weve consistently grown retail balances and customers at ally bank for consecutive quarters and are increasingly leveraging the success as the gateway to our rapidlyexpanding mortgage invest and pointofsale offerings the strong growth trends across each of these relevant and core consumer bank products demonstrate the meaningful expansion opportunity ahead lets turn to slide to review detailed results for the quarter net financing revenue excluding oid of billion represents our highest quarterly level increasing linked quarter and yearoveryear performance was driven by sustained auto pricing trends and strong used car values ongoing funding cost declines and benefits associated with redeployment of excess liquidity adjusted other revenue of million reflected another solid quarter of investment income and diversified revenue growth from our insurance smart option mortgage and invest businesses provision expense reflects the combined benefit of a modest reserve reduction given ongoing economic improvement and strong consumer payment activity retail auto chargeoffs reached the lowest level since noninterest expense of million reflected a continued focus on essentialism across the enterprise as well as investments in business growth and new capabilities we generated billion of core pretax earnings this quarter driving gaap and adjusted eps of

points yearoveryear these results highlight allys unique and embedded tailwinds that will drive ongoing nim expansion over the next several quarters earning asset yield of improved basis points quarteroverquarter reflecting resilient retail auto pricing trends and origination volume strong lease portfolio yields from elevated used car values as vehicle inventories declined from solid demand and slower production ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 trends and the associated benefits of redeploying excess liquidity into higher earning investment securities given rising benchmarks based on strong demand trends we now expect retail origination yields in the range throughout the remainder of the year and given ongoing production uncertainties with the used car values increasing in the midsingle digits for full year average earning assets of billion moved slightly lower quarteroverquarter as dealer floorplan levels declined and mortgage prepayments remained elevated notably we generated growth across all of our remaining loan and lease portfolios during the quarter cost of funds improved basis points the seventh consecutive quarteroverquarter decline reflecting improved deposit costs and ongoing wholesale funding optimization lets turn to slide total deposits ended at billion retail growth of billion was fueled by existing customer balance growth and inflows from new customers customer trends were strong across all measures retention remained industry leading at customer growth from younger generations early in their financial journeys

resumed our share buyback program in  executing million of repurchases we remain on track to achieve our billion boardauthorized plan during with the seb framework set to go into effect beginning july allys strong capital levels and earnings trends position us well moving forward our approach to capital deployment remains consistent centered around investing in growth opportunities across our businesses delivering innovative and differentiated products and driving longterm shareholder value on slide asset quality remains very strong trends across our consumer and commercial portfolios were resilient as consolidated ncos of basis points represented less than half the prioryear level retail auto portfolio trends improved considerably quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear as chargeoffs of million or basis points reflected solid consumer payment trends and improved loss given default rate aiding these results were the benefits of a third round of stimulus and ongoing government support serving as a bridge for consumers facing hardship in the bottom right early and latestage delinquencies ended meaningfully below prioryear levels a positive leading indicator for nearterm loss trend turning to slide consolidated coverage remained relatively flat at as retail auto and ally lending balances grew and floorplan balances which carry significantly lower coverage levels declined retail auto reserves of billion moved modestly lower reflecting favorable credit trends and improved macroeconomic indicators our modeled forecast assumes gradually improving unemployment through the end of this year ending at just above and while we are encouraged by underlying trends across our portfolios and early signs of economic improvements are beginning to emerge we remain well positioned for ongoing uncertainty we believe we are carrying sufficient reserves should ncos exceed normalized levels due to the pandemicrelated activity lets turn to slide to review auto segment highlights net financing revenue expanded quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear from ongoing strength in our retail and lease portfolios retail trends shown in the bottom left demonstrate the consistently strong origination and portfolio yield trends where riskadjusted margins continue to ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 expand and in the bottom right per unit gains maintained strong overall levels leading to million in overall lease gains our focused and differentiated approach to meeting the needs of our dealers and customers drove million in pretax income for the segment and improved riskadjusted returns origination and auto asset trends are on slide we have continually provided broad access to credit for consumers utilizing our disciplined and dynamic underwriting approach while maintaining consistent fico and nonprime trends auto originations of billion in the quarter increased billion yearoveryear and represented our highest  in a decade in the bottom left ending consumer asset expanded to billion with growth across retail and lease portfolios on the bottom right average commercial assets ended at billion as inventory levels reached the 10year low we expect floorplan balances to remain low for the next several quarters reflecting strong demand for vehicles and persistent shipping component shortages that are likely to weigh on factory output turning to insurance results on slide core pretax income of million increased sequentially and year overyear in the bottom left consistent investment portfolio growth creates a diversified revenue stream and enhances segment returns written premiums of million reflected strong fi trends and we generated the highest monthly level of vehicle service contract sales since while

increased linked quarter while the yearoveryear decline reflected the elevated draw activity observed early in the pandemic loan commitment volume of billion represented the highest  on record and our third highest quarter ever while utilization levels remain low in the quarter were well positioned for loan growth moving forward we are confident in the strength of our portfolio evidenced by sustained credit performance and the continued increase in assetbased loans which now comprise of our portfolio up from in mortgage details are on slide pretax income for the segment of million grew quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear as gain on sale economics remained strong more than offsetting the ongoing impact of elevated prepayment activity directtoconsumer originations of billion was our highest quarterly volume since launching in existing deposit customers represented of volume in the quarter demonstrating the high quality nature of our engaged customer base we see a steady path to billion in originations over the next couple of years as we build scale for existing and new customers our alldigital offering allows customers to complete an application in minutes and lock their rate in minutes on slide weve included a refreshed view of our financial outlook given the strong results weve delivered in  we now expect rotce expansion into the midteens to accelerate into excluding the impact of reserve release our longterm returns will be driven by ongoing momentum across our businesses embedded balance sheet tailwinds and organic growth across our product offerings revenue growth and disciplined expense increases will lead to improved ppnr and operating leverage in the range for nim expansion to the low to mid3 range will drive net financing revenue growth in the range yearoveryear we continue to embed a consistent expectation for steady other revenue growth sourced from our broader set of consumer offerings and ongoing insurance activities and as weve noted in the past we embed modest investment gains in our forecast though we remain opportunistic and disciplined in our approach were proud of the value and growth generated across all our businesses driving near and longterm benefits for our stakeholders ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 ill close by reiterating the gratitude and pride i have in our ally teammates who drove our results and positioned us for success over many years by doing it right for our customers communities and shareholders with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you very much jenn i want to wrap up with a few comments on slide number i want to express my gratitude and the deep sense of pride i have in leading this great company our results this quarter are impressive but our broader purpose and cause to serve our customers and communities is what defines the longterm success that remains in front of us im entirely confident in our ability to navigate and win through a variety of environments and market backdrops and i think if you look at the past several quarters were really hitting on this point and were going to continue to execute with a focus on the same values and priorities that have served us really incredibly well over the past several years so really strong quarter were proud of the results jen and i and daniel are super proud of the team it was really across the board outperformance but importantly is the outlook that lies in front of us just got a lot to go here and were really proud of that so daniel with that im going to hand it back to you and dive into qa daniel eller headinvestor relations ally financial inc good thanks jb operator you may begin the qa session question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning jb and jenn the nim outlook jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc good morning jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 good morning the nim outlook seems to keep getting better can you parse out for us how much of the improvement is coming from various drivers including the scaling of some of your smaller businesses and maybe if you could speak to the sustainability jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure ill jump in bill and good morning yes our nim outlook continues to be very strong evidenced in this quarter and ongoing through and beyond indiscernible some of the key drivers on the asset side of the balance sheet we have continued to outperform pricing expectations and retail auto origination flows if you look at just this quarter the billion in retail auto origination is coming in above yield and were now expecting to have our fourth consecutive quarter of new origination yields at that or above so thats a big driver of sustaining the asset yield over time and then potentially even growing that a bit and i would offer just some of the other drivers there our ally lending portfolio continues to grow thats coming in at a nice yield and we continue to see opportunities to put cash to work and loan growth across other categories as well so great trajectory on the assets side and then on the liability side really two drivers there one is the continued optimization of pricing within our deposit portfolio so you see the roll forward on the osa but we dont have cds rolling down well have another kind of billion this year rolling off at over basis points down to under so really nice continued trajectory within the kind of the deposit business and then you have the mix shift as we roll down other funding types whether thats fhlb continuing to roll down or broker deposits rolling down so wed expect another several quarters of reduced cost of funds and so that kind of wraps it up i think were well on our way and i think i started on pages and just talking about how this is really years in the making and what were really experiencing in and beyond is just a roll forward of the strength we have in all of our dominant businesses and then to your point in some of the newer segments as well with ally lending and ally home bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful thanks and jenn i wanted to follow up on your comments around capital how important do you think the new seb framework is to getting to your target level of capital relatively quickly maybe you can just frame for us what kind of trajectory we should expect it for it to take for you guys to get back down to that sort of cet1 range jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah so a couple of things id say just in the near term were not really limited by the extension of the repurchase the fourth quarter earnings test or even kind of the dividend capture because earnings are so strong well have about million in capacity in terms of repurchases so continuing to like our trajectory towards that billion program that or up to billion that our board has authorized and then bill we like the scb framework just because it gives us more flexibility around distribution but honestly we would be revisiting capital distribution even without the scb framework but again anytime you have more flexibility in how you distribute capital thats a net plus for us and then as we look at our total capital levels were over we do expect that to come down and quite honestly its going to take some time well execute ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 our current program and revisit opportunities starting first with the customers and growing our businesses and well look at excess capital through repurchases and potentially increases in dividend as well so its but honestly bill its going to take some time for that to roll down to bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood very helpful thank you for taking my questions jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you so much bill operator our next question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys and congrats on a really outstanding quarter jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you ryan good morning jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you ryan good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc good morning so jb you talked in december about the need for oems to pick up production now were obviously going through this global chip shortage and jenn mentioned you expect floorplan balances to remain low for the next few quarters could you maybe just talk about what youre seeing there and do you think weve actually we bottomed on balances and maybe can you just talk about growth outside of dealer can we see mortgage start to level off as we start to see prepayment speeds slow and just how are you thinking about growth for the other asset categories on the balance sheet jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc sure jenn do you want me to start and jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 yeah so why dont on the oem point yeah weve been fairly vocal on this for a while i mean first you had the impacts and implications of covid and factory shutdowns and so already you were running pretty light inventories and then theres been a variety of factors that have kind of exacerbated problems here chip shortages trucking shortages texas weather events and its pretty amazing how some of these kinks in a supply chain can really further disrupt and so productions slowly starting to improve but similar to jenns last comments on capital i think its going to take a while before this really gets normalized so i suspect were at or around the bottom on floorplan but i dont see balances really meaningfully rising until probably the back half of this year at best so thats probably one of the weak points overall right now its a bit out of our control but obviously as were pointing out this leads to really strong used car markets and obviously weve been originating north of in used for quite some time here and so i think our positioning in the business is holding really well but its going to take some while its going to take some time before inventory gets back up and i do also think a bright spot is consumers want to spend i mean production indiscernible and in fact i was on the phone yesterday with rick hendrick and talking through kind of what theyre experiencing and new cars would hit any other dealers and rick has got about stores i mean theyre selling within a day or two and so youve got this slow production but pretty vicious and aggressive demand out of the consumer so its just going to take a while for things to normalize there but as you point out some of the growth businesses are being a nice offset to that and i think as we do look at its been a pretty aggressive refi environment and mortgage environment but jenn highlighted we feel like weve got a path to really ramp up originations there so there are certainly offsets in the balance sheet that can enable us to continue to grow jenn what else would you want to highlight jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean the only other thing indiscernible great job jb the only other thing id highlight ryan is just that the auto inventory phenomenon is really demanddriven its not that its like in credit cards and some other consumer asset classes where youre seeing a slowdown in demand so i think thats a net plus as we think about the consumer and then really for ally its a win either way if we continue to see inventory levels lower than expected we see the offset in used vehicle pricing as well as in terms of benefits to lgd and our loss estimates and then if we do see inventory pick up we can put cash to work and grow nii and nim from that so netnet its a kind of a winwin either way ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc great and if i could ask one followup when i think about all the pieces that you moved through jenn on the net interest margin it feels like you have a lot of levers with upside to auto yields securities yields can expand theres cash deployment theres also funding levers so it feels like getting to that mid should be more than achievable can you maybe just talk through if we do start to get higher rates as the market seems to be pricing in can you just talk about the sustainability to those margin trends and if we are to get a margin in the mid could we maybe even have some a little bit of upside to the return targets over time thanks jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 yeah sure and i think you hit on it ryan i mean number one this is pretty much baked and its reflective of pages and right weve been at this for years and its largely roll forward at this point in time and as we think about rates potentially rising kind of back half of and into we do see that thats sustainable i mean we think deposit betas will move pretty slowly we do see continued opportunities to optimize yield and flows in the retail auto space as well as our new businesses coming online as well as as you point out the ability to redeploy cash into investment securities at higher rates so number one absolutely this is kind of roll forward number two even in a rising rate environment we see nim expansion and then number three we kind of debated the size of the plus in our guide on page here to your point that yeah there is opportunity to outperform and its kind of across the entire income statement its revenue growth as well as outperformance on credit as well ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for all the color jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah thank you ryan jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks ryan operator our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi two questions first more technical on funding we were just going through that but could you ever imagine getting to deposit funding would that be something that you would want to do or will you always keep a little bond out there just to keep that channel open jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean i think betsy we want to be diversified in terms of our funding mix and we really like the trajectory were on in terms of continuing to increase that percent of deposits but wed always want to have some access to market funding just from a resiliency perspective and we do still have the opportunity kind of within the four walls of deposits to bring down that brokered deposit percentage yearoveryear its down about billion or so betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then bigger picture when i talk to my colleagues on the auto side and the auto team here were always talking about whats going on with evs and how that industry is under such pressure from investors to get more green and climate friendly and blah blah blah so im just wondering im sure this is something thats in your discussion in your boardroom conversations how are you thinking about the ev push how are you thinking ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 about how youre positioned for it right now today anything you need to do for or with your dealers to migrate and anything you can help us understand as to what youre doing on this front jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah so betsy i appreciate the question and absolutely this is a really important discussion across the industry in our boardroom and our management team and as we think about ev we think were really well positioned right we are underwriting those loans leases and insurance for vehicles no matter what kind of vehicle they are and so as ev becomes a bigger percent of the market we are absolutely positioned to take advantage of that and we kind of hit our highest level of ev originations this quarter so we will continue to grow with the market and we think were really well positioned and i think in terms of capabilities i think were pretty much there probably well learn a bit more as we continue to underwrite these types of vehicles understanding lgd understanding on the insurance side kind of what do claims look like but i think were really really well positioned and jb do you want to add anything jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah jenn i think you hit the high point for me betsy obviously youre aware of a lot of the oems are pointing to kind of as a pretty big inflection point and obviously we still think vehicles are going to get largely distributed through the traditional dealer network today so i think as jenn points out were really well positioned we want to help lead in that regard obviously its an interesting space so betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah weve gotten a couple of questions on how does this longerterm impact to used car prices with the underlying assumption that ev autos have longer shelf life so to speak than combustion vehicles is that i mean i know thats like a second or third order effect relative to where we are today and the incredibly hot demand for auto is just really large but is that something that you guys have talked about and do you think that thats a fair statement that ev shelf life is longer jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah yeah betsy i think its still to be determined i think the technology is still evolving right now and i think well learn more and that was kind of my point around understanding lgd just trying to understand kind of what does this look like over time and i think were still in the early innings its about of vehicle purchases right now so well learn over time betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and in the meantime the demand for cars is still extremely hot obviously and so from that last question there do your dealers have any line of sight for when they think demand today is going to be fulfilled i mean how many months quarters years is it to get that demand fulfilled in the current space can you do you have a sense of that ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc hey betsy yeah an interesting question i mean we saw strong demand for vehicles prior to covid and i think if anything covid as weve been talking about the last several quarters has really accelerated personal vehicle ownership and i think this is going to continue to be a strong area for the consumer and it was before covid and itll continue so we dont see this stopping anytime soon and one of the data points we shared kind of early in the deck is just how big this market is so even if you were to see overall consumer demand wane a bit its still a large market and its fairly fragmented so in spite of kind of changes in the consumer trends we think we have a lot of ability to continue to originate in that billion to billion range in accretive yield jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc and dealers are feeling really really good right now obviously pretty big margins theyre making on cars just from the lack of available inventory so a really good time for them betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks betsy jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you operator our next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hi john jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc yeah jenn i think you just referenced in your tail end of your response there that origination range of billion to billion is that kind of how youre thinking about the full year originations at this point in auto i mean how ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 close to the billion could we be and could we be even be above that just given the demand and given the inventory dynamic that you indiscernible out on the new side could we be looking at originations potentially above that billion jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah john we dont have any caps so itll be opportunistic id say out of the gate here in really strong flows strong pricing and here headed into  same trends continuing so we could be closer to that billion than the billion and if we get above that itll just be market dependent but you saw here in the first quarter we had our highest outflow in the history of the company we have the highest number of dealers and so we really like what we see coming in and well just be opportunistic john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay great thanks and then separately on the roe side i heard you in terms of the upside potential potentially to the you specifically mentioned in terms of sizing up the size of the plus there could there also be upside potential to your thoughts around and or is the abating benefit of credit leverage likely to limit that upside potential for those years jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah john in this environment seems pretty far out there but we do have high confidence in that number and we have that confidence because were not embedding any reserve releases and were assuming that retail ncos hit that kind of normalized to range so could there be upside to that absolutely i mean were sitting here in the first quarter with basis points of regional auto ncos and so well see how that path continues in actuals and strong leading indicators there as well so well see but the high confidence is around the fact that we have not embedded really aggressive assumptions on anything whether thats revenue driven or nco credit related john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks jenn jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you john operator our next question comes from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and most of my questions actually have already been asked and answered maybe we could drill down on a couple of the topics that youve talked a little bit about i think the ability to achieve these plus over origination yields has been really impressive and maybe you could kind of just talk a little bit more about some of the specific strategies that youve used and related to the fact of competitive developments that were going on in the industry on your side of the industry right now the lending industry ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure moshe good morning yeah what i would say is look this is a strong market and we have strong capabilities in the market and if you look at the market its large its growing no competitor has kind of over market share and so theres still a lot of room for us to find opportunities and then relative to our capabilities a number of things id point out one is the relationships weve had literally over decades and you see not only dealer count continuing to grow but engagement across those dealers is growing as you think about kind of indiscernible dealer and we have we think significantly more opportunity there especially on the engagement side and then second continuing to evolve our capabilities and that takes a number of different forms of how we deliver our products through digital means weve continued to help our dealers transition digitally weve continued to lean into used as ive talked about for several quarters and so just staying focused on our customers focused on delivering for them adding new capabilities to be successful for our end consumers and our dealers and just continuing to find that opportunity and as you pointed out that this will be our fourth year in a row of putting deals on the books so its kind of in that range moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc right a followup is about the questions around you addressed it in the last question and a couple of the others about the sustainability of returns post this year and i guess and maybe are there steps that youre taking in a year like this where obviously the level of earnings whether the ability to reduce the equity base how important is that in the ability to sustain better than returns and any other steps that youre taking during that youd share with us thanks jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure moshe i mean it really starts with our businesses so we are continuing to invest in differentiated capabilities and thats across auto its across our deposit franchise those capabilities reduce price elasticity across the board and allow us to continue due to our strong pricing position deliver that nim expansion continuing to invest in our newer businesses which are really starting to accrete return here in and growing into and and so you see volumes up in our directtoconsumer mortgage space and a lot of opportunity there and weve talked about that billion number but with our leading digital capabilities i think theres a lot of market share opportunity ally lending continues to grow were investing both in human capital as well as digital capabilities there and then corporate finance as well continues to accelerate and so absolutely were taking measures across every one of our businesses to remain competitive remain differentiated and then as we think about capital deployment well we are in good shape to execute the billion of share repurchases well continue to find other opportunities organically or inorganically to deploy capital accretively and we see equity coming down but its not its going to take some time to get there moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and congratulations ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you moshe operator our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning and great quarter and good job question on the rotce again and we get a lot of questions on it so i figured let me just get in on that jenn i know you mentioned its exreserve release and you talked about continued strength in the nim and youre not even being aggressive on revenue expectations so maybe just taking the other side of that where are the risks to not achieving those targets in the period outside of the economy sort of changing gears jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah so sanjay you asked this question last quarter too so let me reiterate not too much has changed since then but within kind of the four walls of ally theres not too much that can go off the rails i mean and we talked about kind of the years of continuing to build dominant businesses on both sides of the balance sheet and much of that nim trajectory is largely baked i mean about of our retail auto book is already at that yield so the migration up to the was kind of fair and were seeing opportunities to sustain that ph and then some and then on the deposit side weve talked a lot about not just the continued growth there and as we grow those balances as well as digital capabilities the beta on that business is going to continue to decline and so a lot of what were seeing in the nim is baked and then our new businesses are continuing to accelerate were operating in a digital world and consumers are not only working from home theyre banking from home and every single one of our new businesses hit records this quarter and we dont see any of that slowing down in and beyond into and so to your question the rest i really think theyre exogenous i think its continued regulatory changes potential changes in the economy whether thats inflationary driven that could change consumer spend or have some kind of additional kind of economic shock and then taxes i mean to be determined on the tax rate i think were well positioned relative to tax changes but i really think any kind of risks to the trajectory are going to come from outside the four walls of ally sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and the followup question is on the dealers you obviously have increased the penetration on that dealer to and the dealer count is really high at this point i mean could you just talk about the runway for growth from here whether its penetrating those existing the new dealers that youre bringing on as well as just growing that dealer count from here jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 yes sanjay i think its kind of all of the above were going to continue to grow dealers indiscernible newer entrants as well as traditional dealers i think were not as concerned about dealer counts but more quality of dealer relationships so i think we have shared in the past the vast majority of our dealers give us less than kind of five contracts per month and were looking to continue to increase dealer engagement and contracts by dealer and then continuing to grow with those who are growing in the industry and some of thats traditional kind of ma led and some of that is just the growth of kind of the carvanas and the new entrants and so we see a lot of opportunity quite frankly across the board on all measures sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator our next question comes from kevin barker with piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you just to follow up on the some of your loan origination yields are you seeing any impact from increasing competition in the most recent quarter given the reengagement of some banks in the auto sector ph and expansion of their credit box and then also on a followup to that are you seeing any additional competitive forces from more new entrants looking to do direct lending as opposed to establishing dealer relationships and so forth jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah so kevin ill jump in and jb may want to add but in terms of just the competitive environment we have seen kind of some of the larger banks and regionals growing originations in this sector and we would expect that to happen because its a thriving market what i would say is its mostly on the two ends of the barbell its predominantly in superprime and if you look at pricing betas in the superprime theyre much higher than they are in the prime space in the belly of the curve in fact our price elasticity in that space over time has been really resilient so we havent really felt it in kind of the sweet spot of to fico and then used but i think its something that well be managing over time and then in the direct space very small kind of impacts across the board and we are well positioned we have a direct product so if the market does move towards more direct sales were well prepared for that but not seeing a lot of movement there kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay are you seeing any impact from more consumers buying cars not on dealer lots but just doing it online or directly and arranging your own financing or and i guess maybe that relates directly to your direct lending comments as well so jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co have you seen any impact from that jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah no kevin id yes on your first question no on your second question so the carvanas of the world are absolutely growing and that digital product is something thats taking off and even digital shopping and then fulfillment through the dealers is increasing but on your second question no not seeing a lot of that at all financing is largely through the dealers kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you very much jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you kevin operator the next question comes from arren cyganovich with citi arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks in the press release you mentioned ally lending is going to have a retail launch in maybe just share a little bit about the launch there and expectations and what kind of product im assuming its pointofsale but is it softline that kind of retailfocused jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure good morning arren so ally lending has been expanding into new verticals and so weve originally purchased allys health credit services and has been very successful in the health vertical weve since expanded into home and about of our originations have grown over the last several quarters through that home launch and to your question specifically were working towards launching a product in the retail space through our partnership with sezzle and so we see a lot of growth opportunity in fact this kind of retail is the largest point ofsale market that we want to have a product we have a great offering and we see growth opportunities and thats really what the press release is alluding to arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc and i think weve probably talked about this in the past but the does it make sense to grow this organically or given the competitive environment for pointofsale lending does it make sense to maybe buy something a little bit bigger and have a little bit more of a head start ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah aaron this is kind of a b2b2c so its fairly scalable organically and were demonstrating that right and then look at the trajectory of originations just even from when we acquired ally lending and were well on our way to a couple billion so we have a robust platform we can originate across kind of all verticals and as we add partners partnerships onto the platform and merchant accounts we can scale this very quickly organically i mean that being said were always opportunistic around accretive opportunities but we really think this is an organic ph place arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc great thank you daniel eller headinvestor relations ally financial inc
