increase dealer engagement this strategy has culminated in a 40plus percent increase in application volume driving strong originations and risk adjusted returns robust product expansion and customer growth have translated to improved balance sheet and earnings covered over the next few pages turning to slide our balance sheet transformation reflects two key dynamics first the diversification of our asset base which has grown by billion or since over this timeframe weve generated billion or a fivefold increase in ally bank consumer and commercial product balances billion of consumer auto balances helping to mitigate the pandemicdriven floor plan decline and nearly billion in accretive capital efficient investment security the second driver of our optimization can be found within net interest margin shown on the bottom of the page where disciplined asset pricing deposit growth and active liability management have increased asset yields and improved funding costs auto pricing has remained above for four consecutive years while floating rate commercial and unsecured products are positioned for further growth and accretion as rates rise on the funding side weve more than doubled stable sticky deposits since while retiring billion of legacy unsecured debt with a weighted average coupon of over these actions drove structurally lower funding costs throughout the prevailing low rate environment and enhanced our ability to control liability costs in the years ahead we expect our balance sheet to drive an upper margin as assets steadily migrate towards billion structural enhancements across both side of our balance sheet drove strong performance over the past two years and position us well for a variety of rate and economic environment moving forward turning to slide

day one reserve build of million associated with closing fair square and the seasonal rise in ncos even as loss frequency and severity trends demonstrate continued strength noninterest expense of

used car values we included retail portfolio trends in the bottom left where origination yields remained above again in which we expect to continue as we generate over billion of volume annually moving forward on the bottom right lease activities reflects the impact of record used car values and elevated lessee and dealer buyout activity which tempered realized gains in within our financial outlook we assume steady normalization of these trends providing us yet another opportunity to demonstrate our ability to effectively navigate changes within the auto ecosystem within our financial outlook for revenues and credit weve embedded an assumption for used values to decline by to cumulatively by the end of even as recent trends indicate ongoing resilience execution within auto reflects our diversified full spectrum capabilities expanded market reach experienced underwriting and increased use of technology turning to slide our agile adaptable platform enables us to source strong volume across a variety of environment in the upper left we generated billion of origination volume in sourced from our network of over dealers and in consumer assets expanded to billion shown in the

team we remain confident in the continued disciplined growth of this business moving forward mortgage details are on slide where pretax income remains relatively stable during the quarter as asset growth helped to mitigate normalizing gain on sale margins and persistently elevated prepayment trends ally home originated billion in directtoconsumer volume in  exceeding billion for our full year

with our financial outlook weve consistently demonstrated earnings expansion and improved returns through several years of execution our clear vision priorities and strategy have positioned ally to continue generating meaningful and sustained value in the years ahead we expect rotce of to plus over the mediumterm defined as the next two to three years and beyond as we further leverage our leading businesses and highquality balance sheets to drive financial performance notably while our return targets do not depend on uniquely strong macroeconomic trends or pockets of transitory dynamics we will remain opportunistic capturing upside beyond these ranges results will be fueled by revenue driven ppnr expansion derived from an upper nim profile and diversified revenue generation among our established and broadened consumer offerings weve included several of the key variables and assumptions embedded within our forecast including benchmark interest rates credit expectations and used vehicle value trends based on the balanced approach weve taken in our outlook and the strong momentum across all our businesses i am confident in our ability to consistently generate profitable growth enhance book value and sustained returns and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you so much jenn ill close with just a few comments on slide number our purpose and cause will remain centered on our customers employees and communities we built a profitable compelling growth company by meeting customer needs through differentiated products and services ally has pivoted to an exciting era of growth the dedication of our 10000plus ally teammates fuels my confidence in the ability we have to drive an even brighter future ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2022 and with that daniel back to you and head into qa daniel eller headinvestor relations ally financial inc thanks jb so as we head into qa ill ask participants to limit yourself to one question and one followup operator you can go ahead and tee up the first question question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ryan nash from goldman sachs your line is now open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning jb good morning jenn jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hi ryan jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so jb you outlined in the slides to 18plus percent returns in and the mediumterm i think jenn said two to three years and beyond and i wanted to maybe focus on the plus so can you maybe just talk about some of the assumptions that are underlying maybe give us a little bit more color and maybe what are some of the sources of upside that we could see over the next one to two years that are not baked into the to jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc sure jenn you want to take it or i mean a few ill start with ryan and then jenn can go through the details obviously i mean youd look at our levels of reserves relative to the levels of loss expectations and i think our guidance on credit i think you see weve taken a very pragmatic and gradual normalization to credit but that would be certainly a big one and then obviously used car prices i think as jenn has guided we see them within our financial plan as moderating but i think if you look at current trends you look at the environment i mean used car prices are still really strong and as jenn pointed out we are seeing some very modest uptick in inventory levels but our outlook i think this year is a really robust used car market so i mean those were a couple jenns obviously got all the details behind it but we feel really good about the outlook ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2022 jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah jb i think you nailed it the only thing i would add is just around gains in our insurance portfolio weve been able to optimize our equity market activity and drive outsized gains and so that potentially ryan could be another area of upside but i think youre asking the right question i think theres an asymmetric bias here towards outperforming the to 18plus percent and its indiscernible its reserves its used vehicle pricing that jb hit on plus our ability to generate gains ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and jenn if i could just dig into the expectations for the upper net interest margin can you may just flesh out some of the assumptions that are underlying this in terms of your assumptions on rates your ability to drive price in the loan book and i guess more importantly what are the expectations over that timeframe for deposit betas just given you guys have obviously done a great job building the liquidity on the balance sheet and im wondering can we end up seeing you exceed prior cycles just given all the work that you guys have done on the deposit side thanks jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure ill start first on the yields and then go to liabilities but on asset yields 90plus percent of our retail auto portfolio was originated at 7plus percent yields and so we are expecting ryan just to continue to see retail auto yields continue to migrate up towards that 7plus percent and then if rates continue to say increase as were expecting that could potentially go even higher we also have floating rate assets as were growing floor plan jb mentioned were starting to see some increases in floor plan those are floating rate assets they would migrate higher as rates increase weve increased our asset sensitivity just through pay fixed hedging activity kind of maxed out our hedging which will also give us some tailwind so netnet when we wrap this all up plus fair square ally lending we see a really robust trajectory ahead on asset yields in particular if we see rising rates and then on the liability side both mix and deposits will help us we have a much healthier liability stack having runoff expensive high cost unsecured debt our deposit levels are of funding and then when you look at the value were providing to our customers based on products our digital platform and the fact that were core funded now we do think ryan to your question specifically around deposit pricing that overall rate paid will be lower in this next rising rate cycle so you wrap it all up in the first couple of pages the transformation weve led the product capability expansion in the asset side the transformation of our funding profile it positions us so well to hit that upper nim irrespective of the rate environment and to your question gives us opportunity to outperform as well ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for taking my questions jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah thanks ryan ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2022 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks ryan operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bill carcache from wolfe research your line is now open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning jb and jenn jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hey good morning bill jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc can you discuss the trajectory that youre expecting for nim particularly in light of changes in fed funds and all the moving parts the guidance on the slide is super helpful but maybe just a little bit of color and direction should we be expecting nim to be normalizing higher or lower versus jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and bill ill jump in here and weve been guiding towards nim expansion now for years so if you take a step back this has been a guide irrespective of the rate trajectory and its all the things i just described to ryan around the transformation of our asset side in balance sheet as well as our liability stack and so bill we are expecting nim to expand irrespective of rate that said in a rising rate environment we do think that theres an accelerated opportunity to expand earning asset yields just walked through some of the drivers there around floating rate assets growing floor plan at the right time adding short duration assetsensitive assets like ally lending and fair square that will all give us growing momentum in a rising rate environment to continue to see earning asset yield expansion and then on the liability side the healthier stack we have plus the fact that were so well positioned from customer brand engagement digital capabilities we do think that well be able to hold funding costs much better in this rate environment rising rate environment than the last one and so thatll fuel that trajectory into and allow us to sustain it into beyond so thats some of the dynamics there bill and hopefully that helps to answer your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2022 yeah jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc this is not a ratedriven nim expansion this is all about structural improvements and transformation bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thats helpful and then separately as a followup can you speak to the trajectory of the reserve rate and how youre thinking about growth dynamics as you grow the card business the fact that youre starting off the year above your day one level should help dampen those headwinds and then sort of tacking onto that as the card business grows given sort of thats a higher loss content business should there be some expectation that at some point you would raise your target capital expectations if you could just touch on that thank you jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and on the overall reserve its largely driven by retail auto so let me start there and ill go to some of the smaller portfolios but retail auto right now is at day one was at so were running at basis points ahead of day one and i think that to jbs point in his prepared remarks really helps us to manage through any kind of economic cycle that we could see ahead but if you look at the path of normalization in our path history we would expect over time as ncos normalize that that rate would come down from the somewhere closer to that so i think if anything bill that gives us some tailwinds heading into and and then on some of the newer products that will have higher coverage levels i think were very well reserved there fair square we just put on at a coverage ratio ally lending is close to that so i think were just in a really good spot there not going to drive upside but well be growing that and the mix may change a slightly higher consolidated level but if you wrap it all up with retail auto being as big as it is with as high a reserve coverage level from a consolidated perspective that should come down over time and then on our capital target look we feel that we are very well positioned we are adding some new portfolios with fair square and ally lending but theyre about billion today and well grow this to from here but its not a big enough percent of our portfolio to really revisit the target and then also keep in mind were holding against a floor plan balance that is relatively riskfree so we feel really good bill about our cet1 target bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you for taking my questions jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you of course operator thank you our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley your line is now open ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hey good morning betsy jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc a couple of questions here first as were thinking about the fair square integration getting behind you can you give us a sense as to the timing and the size that youre going to be thinking about in terms of expanding that portfolio and what the levers are to affecting that jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure so were at about million in balances today and we see a path mediumterm the billion to billion betsy and i think if anything theyve shown an ability to really accelerate both customer growth and balance sheet growth both are up over yearoveryear and the balances are running ahead of just the projections that we shared with you in october so theyre seeing a really robust growth trajectory were right now seeing kind of a path to billion billion but well continue to monitor and take it from there indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i mean thats obviously a sorry go ahead jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean its just very compelling customer segment and product focus that is allowing them to continue to grow and i would just point out that they grew during one of the toughest credit card market in history as we navigated covid betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so that piece of the portfolio expanding clearly net positive to nim floor plan is a little bit of a lower nim contributor and i know in the past youve talked about funding that via securities to help keep the nim moving higher how much room is there in that piece of securities shift into floor plan and im asking the question from a context of your guide for upper nim what keeps you from seeing that guide move into low as these piece parts are coming through here ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2022 jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and betsy we obviously have upside from floor plan and its on a couple different dimensions one is just the floating rate assets so as shortterm rates increase that will naturally migrate the yield up and second to your point on funding were reallocating cash into floor plan so that gives us another tailwind from a mix perspective and as i mentioned earlier in response to ryans question theres a lot of opportunity for earning asset yield to continue to migrate higher plus the fact that we think were very well positioned to manage liability costs down so there is an opportunity to go to that 4plus percent its just we try to provide balanced guidance as we look forward but certainly theres upside opportunity there betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then separately on the outlook here for used car values which does feed into a couple of parts of the income statement how should we think about what youve got here the modeling 15plus decline by yearend like is that how did you get to that assessment in the guide and what kind of pace are you thinking about that coming through the model jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and let me hit on model and then reality weve modeled eight straightline reduction from to down to i think if we look at pace of used vehicle value that continues to increase and so the reality is theres probably upside to that but again were trying to give you kind of a run rate view of returns and well be opportunistic around upside as we were certainly in here but the model just assumes kind of straightline reduction there and then another factor id call your attention to because theres so much focus on used vehicle values as we exited the lessee buyout and the dealer buyout was increasing to and so thats muted our ability to harvest gains and it lowers the yearoveryear comp as we head into so just keep that in mind its not quite as big a fallout as i think some folks are modeling at this point in time and then the last thing id say on used vehicle values is we do have natural hedges just as we had a hedge with floor plan coming down used vehicle values going up and impacting lease yields positively we have the hedge on the reverse right so as lease yields come down well see floor plan growing and you get all the great dynamics around putting cash to work floating rate asset increasing so just keep that in mind that theres positive hedges as these vehicle values come down just like there was if they went up betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thanks jenn thanks jb jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah thank you betsy jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2022 thanks betsy operator thank you our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch from cs your line is now open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks very much youve alluded to this in the opening comments but youve got kind of better loan growth that youve had in a while youve got reasonable growth in retail auto and then kind of growth across the portfolios could you talk about how that is likely to trend over the next year or two and then ive got a followup thanks jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure moshe and i mentioned assets getting to billion in our mediumterm and thats driven by all the portfolios you just mentioned i mean in retail auto we were originating at mid30 billion we hit billion this year were guiding towards low billion and so as we continue to see opportunities to originate at a higher level that will obviously take our retail portfolio higher also seeing strong growth in lease as well floor plans obviously come back we saw it kind of trough in september and steady growth from there and i think itll be a little choppy from here on out well see but definitely opportunities in floor plan to come back and then the unsecured capabilities that weve recently added with ally lending with fair square each of those portfolios could get to billion to billion over time and then last but not least weve seen really nice opportunities to originate in mortgage weve pulled forward kind of our billion target into this year and well see how that plays out but we really like our capabilities and weve expanded into new markets with mortgage systems and growth opportunities there and floor plan continues to be a steady driver we always talked about im sorry corporate finance always tends to be a steady driver weve talked about billion to billion in that portfolio we already hit billion i think well on our way to billion as you look at the total opportunity in that segment and then well put cash to work in securities as well so really across the board moshe we see really nice tailwinds and opportunities to grow in addition to the nim expansion that weve been talking about this morning moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc right and your mediumterm kind of forecast talks about ppnr expansion on an annual basis one of the concerns that investors have had about the financials after the reports of the big banks has been expense growth can you kind of talk about your plans because obviously ppnr expansion means that your revenues got to grow faster than expenses but can you just talk about the plans for generating operating efficiencies and how you think about that particularly in light of the context the remarks jb that you made about minimum wage phasing that in and kind of how that will integrate into your plan over the next couple of years jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and moshe just as a reminder we dont manage kind of single line item point in time weve been managing the company to drive accretive returns and weve been investing in growth and what i shared with you ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2022 in the first couple of pages around continuing to invest in capabilities grow customers grow our balance sheet grow returns that is the focus of us just in general and weve been investing as a growth company weve seen kind of midsingle digit expense growth over the last couple of years wed expect to continue to see that but as weve demonstrated in the past were focused on positive operating leverage ppnr expansion robust return trajectory and you should expect more of that to come from a ppnr as well as operating leverage perspective now i will note that with fair square coming into well have one month of expenses rolling forward to months so theres some nuances there we do see positive operating leverage as we get into but definitely just some technical impacts this year from fair square but you wrap it all up a lot of focus on expenses but for us its really around growing our businesses and growing revenue we saw revenue up this year we have a very robust trajectory as we head into and and well keep investing but leverage is front and center all the time moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks very much jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah thank you moshe operator thank you our next question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani from kbw your line is now open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i guess ive got a question on the retail auto yield i mean i guess your expectations are that continues to remain strong im just curious i know a lot of its been driven by mix inside of retail auto but as we think about just maybe competitive forces coming back into play how much of a factor do you think it plays into that yield going forward and over the next couple of years jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sanjay its the fourth year of putting strong origination indiscernible the books at 7plus percent yields and were guiding toward similar performance as we head into and its simply a result of the growth in dealers growth in dealer engagement where we think we still have significant opportunity for expansion its the continued investment in our capabilities including our smartauction platform insurance and so we dont see any signs that that will slow down as we head into and beyond and competition is always intense we arent seeing that interrupt our flows or impact our performance whatsoever as we head into and beyond jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc and sanjay just obviously a reminder number one lender in the prime space one of the largest used lenders and to get that type of performance you need to have significant scale which is something we bring and so i think were large were fast the dealers like us weve automated a lot of our riskbased decisions so we ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2022 respond very quickly so yes we recognize players come and go but i think the one thing that dealers appreciate about ally is our stability and thats part of the one of the big drivers why we continue to see a big uptick in origination flows and why jenn just guided even into the low billion so its pretty strong loan growth yearonyear sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no absolutely you guys have executed really well i guess maybe another question on competition and follows along some of the questions that moshe was asking in terms of expenses on the consumer lending side that targeted growth that you expect for fair square i mean like is that just more direct marketing and therefore there shouldnt be a significant rampup in marketing spend because weve heard the big banks as well as some of the card issuers talk about ramping up expenses to get new accounts im just curious sort of how you expect to go to market there and do you expect some pressure on expenses as you build that business out and how does it factor into the growth that youre expecting jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah and i think fair square is a bit unique its similar to what jb just mentioned on auto its kind of a unique product for a unique market theyre originating in that prime space which is not nearly as computed as the super prime space and so the direct marketing that theyve been doing has been highly effective as reflected in the 60plus percent increase in customer accounts as well as the growth in the balance sheet and all of the expenses attached to that are in the really robust guidance ive provided which is kind of immediately accretive from an rotce perspective it will be accretive from an eps perspective by yearend this year and it will drive operating leverage as we head into so you can see that our investments are paying off from a growth and a profitability perspective and i think if anything we can turbocharge that growth by bringing them in inside the four walls of ally and leveraging our existing customer base sanjay which is not going to require significant additions to our marketing spend sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and how much of that is factor like is this crosssell a big part of the growth expectation or is that just benefit added benefit jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah none of that sanjay is built into any of the numbers that we share thatll be all upside and again it will be driven by synergies across our platforms much more so than increase in marketing spend sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2022 but sanjay i mean i would point out though what sometimes crosssell gets knocked and the question of can you really do it i think if you look at our growth in multiproduct relationships it shows we are actually one of the banks thats executing in that regard and so while we dont necessarily have it embedded in the guidance i think thats a clear focus point for us so how do we use the crosssell of a massive customer base i mean if you think of kind of another million customers excredit card its even bigger than that that exists at ally that is an opportunity that we will go after sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you sanjay operator our next question comes from the line of arren cyganovich from citi your line is now open arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks maybe not to stay on card for too much but it is kind of an exciting new area for you but whats the strategy for are you going to rebrand to ally are you going to go up market a little bit or are you just going to kind of let them operate under that fair square brand for the nearterm jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah and thank you arren we agree its an exciting opportunity and the short answer here is were going to let them continue to execute the way theyve been executing over the last five years its been a tremendous product growth story for them and we dont want to interrupt the execution on that front in parallel we are looking to rebrand their cards we will do so by year end and we do think that theres product expansion opportunities as we just talked about over time but thats going to be something we grow into as we think about the broader ally customer ecosystem and then last but not least just a huge shout out to that team its just been a tremendous experience bringing them on board they know what theyre doing theyve got decades of experience in card and we couldnt be more excited about the team the products the opportunity ahead in the cards space arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc great and then just lastly theres been a little bit of concern about credit in the personal installment loan space with a lot of new entrants into the market what are you seeing within ally lending on the credit side jennifer a laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean i would point to our performance which has been robust i think its a large its a rapidly growing market so theres no surprise that theres new entrants in that space but we feel really well positioned especially in the verticals where were focused home improvement healthcare are dominant areas for us weve ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2022 continued to be able to grow margins in that space as well as originations and balances so were not surprised that theres some new entrants but we feel really good about our products and our performance and just as a reminder were not kind of bnpl indiscernible product thats getting a lot of scrutiny across the industry just in terms of consumer oriented practices this is a traditional installment product we go through traditional credit underwriting we have robust credit risk management around this product so feel great about the opportunity ahead daniel eller headinvestor
