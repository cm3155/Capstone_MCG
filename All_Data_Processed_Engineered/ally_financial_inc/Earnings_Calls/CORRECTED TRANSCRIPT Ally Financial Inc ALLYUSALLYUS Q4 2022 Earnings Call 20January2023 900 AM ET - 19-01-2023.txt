rotce of and revenues of billion reflected another year of solid financial results rotce was approximately excluding the impact of oci we completed billion of share repurchases over the course of the year and this week our board approved a first quarter common dividend of per share we build businesses that are nimble and able to pivot against a fluid backdrop we maintain healthy levels of capital reserves and liquidity which position us well for this dynamic environment within auto finance consumer originations of billion were sourced from million applications across more than dealer relationships the average originated yield of basis points expanded basis points on a fullyear basis in total we put nearly basis points of price into the market largely inline with changes in the fed funds rate industry vehicle sales remain below prepandemic levels but our ability to generate strong originations shows the benefits of our scale and depth of application flow net chargeoffs in retail auto were basis points for the year in the fourth quarter net chargeoffs increased to basis points as we saw accelerated normalization within the quarter brad will cover losses in more detail as well as our current thinking for this year within insurance written premiums again exceeded billion driven by strong relationships with dealers our insurance team remains focused on leveraging synergies with the auto finance sales team and we remain optimistic about the organic growth opportunities for this business going forward turning to ally bank retail deposit balances increased billion yearoveryear ending at nearly billion we generated billion in retail deposit growth in the secondhalf of the year while maintaining a very balanced approach to pricing we continue to see strong momentum in retail deposit customer growth and ended the year with million customers up yearoveryear weve seen increased consumer engagement and adoption trends across other ally bank product offerings ally home originations of billion were down yearoveryear reflecting broader mortgage market conditions equity market trends resulted in a decline in ally invest assets while active accounts increased to ally lending generated origination volume of billion as we added merchant relationships across home improvement and healthcare verticals ally credit card reached billion of loan balances from more than million active cardholders the card team also reached a key milestone in the fourth quarter as we rolled out a lineup of allybranded credit cards im proud of what weve accomplished on the integration over the past months and excited about the continued opportunities which lie ahead corporate finance continues to generate steady loan growth with the heldforinvestment portfolio reaching billion with growth coming primarily from assetbased lending turning to slide number our longterm strategic priorities remain unchanged even as we navigate this dynamic environment our

harnesses the true power of over teammates and empowers everyone to make a difference i firmly believe a strong culture is essential to delivering for our customers communities and stakeholders and that all starts with taking care of our employees weve consistently prioritized investment in our people and culture and our actions in reflect that commitment in the past months weve increased our

in the communities we live and work in we work hard to nurture this culture across the enterprise and im confident it will be a differentiator for ally now more than ever lets turn to slide number before diving into the fourth quarter details id like to highlight allys multiyear strategic and financial transformation which demonstrate the steady execution and strong performance over our longer lens than a quarter or two in nearly years as a publicly traded company weve consistently worked to remain a disruptor and execute against our longterm priorities which has resulted in sustained improvements in operational and financial results within auto and insurance weve transitioned from a captive auto finance company to a marketleading diversified lender with dealer relationships of increasing roughly while application flow of nearly million is up almost ally bank remains the largest alldigital bank in the us while the direct banking industry was largely unproven when we launched ally bank our steady growth to billion of retail deposits and million customers make it clear our model and our brand resonates with consumers our balance sheet has evolved through optimization within auto finance along with expansion into other consumer lending verticals overall earning assets are up billion since our ipo which includes billion of nonauto loan growth this growth has generated billion of revenue expansion this evolution has created a structurally more profitable company nim of is up basis points from where we were in and is driven by optimization on both sides of the balance sheet throughout this transformation weve remained disciplined on capital allocation and ensured were adequately reserved shares outstanding have declined book value excluding the temporary headwind from oci has effectively doubled and we maintained a billion loan loss reserve these metrics reflect years of consistent execution and give me confidence in our ability to deliver in the years ahead slide number reflects our focus on growing an engaged customer base we now serve million customers across our businesses which represents a increase since ally bank customers have more than quadrupled over this timeframe as weve evolved expanded and enhanced our digital capabilities our consumer lending products are resonating and customers want to deepen their relationship with ally evidenced by the ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 significant growth in multiproduct customers shown at the bottom of the page across auto and insurance weve added customers as weve leveraged our strength and scale in the market as the leading independent fullspectrum lender this product expansion and customer growth have translated into an improved balance sheet composition and expanded earnings which ill cover over the next few pages turning to slide number since weve significantly transformed our balance sheet as weve optimized auto and expanded additional consumer offerings loans and leases have increased billion or since through disciplined expansion across all our lending products auto assets have been relatively stable as growth in higher yielding retail assets has been offset by a decline in floor plan balances while not reflected in the charts the return profile of the auto finance business has dramatically improved as we strategically shifted into the intersection of prime and used ally bank consumer and commercial products had grown since and now make up billion of balances and its important to keep in mind that while weve recently added point ofsale lending and credit card capabilities our balance sheet remains secured on slide number you can see weve driven substantially higher net interest margin given the optimization across both sides of our balance sheet nim increased basis points from given expanded earning asset yields and an improved liability construct the optimization within auto has increased yields while expanded consumer lending offerings have provided incremental tailwinds our liability stack shows equally meaningful progress in we were only depositfunded relative to today marketbased funding has declined by more than billion the transformation of our funding profile has driven cost of funds down nearly basis points despite average fed funds being basis points higher while we face nearterm pressure on margin given our liabilitysensitive position this optimization on both sides of the balance sheet positions us with a much improved nim despite the rapid rise in interest rates brad will share more on margin dynamics later turning to slide number total revenue of billion represents a increase since net financing revenue of billion has nearly doubled through balance sheet transformation in the strategic positioning of the auto finance business other revenues has also expanded as weve grown feegenerating businesses like insurance and smartauction investment gains will fluctuate with market conditions but we see a path to a billionplus annual other revenue stream the bottom of the page highlights the significant progress across our ally bank businesses revenue in of billion has increased more than billion since our ipo and is up in just the last few years moving to slide number we show the consistent credit performance of our largely secured balance sheet and significant reserve coverage relative to losses on a consolidated basis net chargeoffs of basis points compared to a coverage rate of within retail auto net chargeoffs of basis points reflect normalization off historical lows the retail auto reserve of remains elevated versus cecl day we feel comfortable our reserves position us well for a variety of environments as weve consistently taken a conservative approach in our reserve methodology slide number adds additional perspective on absolute levels of our reserves and excess capital the billion allowance on our balance sheet is roughly billion higher than cecl day and positions us well to absorb expected lifetime losses based on the current economic outlook and our capital position creates significant buffer against unexpected losses and volatility while weve largely normalized excess capital relative to our internal targets we continue to maintain billion of cet1 above our regulatory minimum under the scb framework the ultimate path of the economy over the nearterm remains fluid but we feel very good about the reserve and capital position of the company ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 moving to slide number we highlighted our steady growth in book value per share at yearend book value per share excluding the impact of oci was up since we understand the magnitude of interest rate movements has heightened the focus on aoci and the mark on our securities book but we feel the figure is a better representation of the true intrinsic value of our company the existing mark will fully amortize back to par over time and declines in rates like we saw in the fourth quarter will accelerate book value generation the bottom of the page shows the progress weve made in buying back shares at levels below the intrinsic value of the company since the inception of our repurchase program in  outstanding are down creating significant value for longterm holders we recognize theres a lot of focus on our earnings trajectory over the next few quarters but its important to consider the tailwinds that have been created by a fundamental transformation over the past several years and with that ill turn it over to brad to cover our detailed financial results bradley brown corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jb good morning everyone ill begin on slide net financing revenue excluding the oid of billion was up slightly yearoveryear driven by continued strength in origination volumes and auto pricing higher funding costs given the rapid increase in shortterm rates partially offset through our hedging position and growth in unsecured consumer products adjusted other revenue of million reflected continued momentum across our insurance smartauction and consumer banking businesses elevated investment gains in drove the yearoveryear decline provision expense of million reflected a continued normalization of credit and modest reserve build to support loan growth and to reflect the evolving macro environment noninterest expense of billion reflect investments in our growing businesses and in technology as we mentioned during our last call the fourth quarter included a million charge consisting of the final impact of the termination of our legacy pension plan results also reflect the tax impact related to that termination which drove million of tax expense and increased the tax rate in the quarter by approximately percentage points gaap and adjusted eps for the quarter were and respectively moving to slide net interest margin excluding oid at decreased basis points yearoveryear and basis points quarteroverquarter the impact of rapid increases in shortterm rates and the repricing dynamics of our balance sheet creates some nearterm margin pressure we still see nim troughing around which ill cover in more detail shortly and remain confident in our ability to return to a margin over time fourth quarter nim benefited from continued increases in retail auto originated yields declining retail auto prepayment activity and growth within our commercial and unsecured consumer lending segment total loans and leases are up nearly billion versus prior year while declines in cash and securities resulted in total earning asset growth of roughly billion earning asset yield of grew basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points yearoveryear reflecting a continuation of trends weve highlighted previously including strong originated yields within retail auto growth in higher yielding assets and more than billion of floating rate exposures across the loan and hedging portfolios retail auto portfolio yield expanded basis points from the prior quarter due to continued increases in originated yields and a decline in prepayments which have been pressuring yields since mid2021 including the impact of hedges yields reached up basis points quarteroverquarter and we expect yields to migrate toward throughout similar to the prior quarter commercial portfolio yields expanded as their floating nature benefits from higher rates turning to liabilities cost of funds increased basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points yearoveryear the increase in deposit cost was inline with what we shared last quarter and reflect higher benchmark rates and a competitive direct bank market for deposits ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 slide provides incremental detail on our outlook for margin we continue to expect nearterm compression and nim to trough around basis points assuming the forward curve and the fed funds peak of in retail auto we added basis points of price into the market in and are currently originating loans in the range on the positive side our osa pricing has moved up basis points as of yearend the prices in retail auto were basis points in excess of what we passthrough on osa despite that surprising momentum the timing dynamics we have highlighted previously will remain a margin headwind until we get through the fed tightening cycle similar to the last quarter the bottom of the page highlights the two largest drivers of our nim trajectory retail originated yields were and given the portfolio yield its still more than basis points lower than originated yields we see meaningful portfolio expansion ahead by the fourth quarter of we expect portfolio yield will increase to roughly without assuming any incremental pricing actions on new retail auto originations the bottom right shows the evolution of retail deposit pricing at yearend our osa was priced at basis points while average retail deposit cost in the quarter were just over basis points deposit pricing has remained dynamic and competitive and incremental betas were a little higher in the fourth quarter and while were not providing a specific outlook for osa pricing we continue to see a nim trough in a scenario where liquid deposits go to basis points clearly there is a range of possible outcomes but we feel very good about our overall nim trajectory turning to slide our cet1 ratio remained at as earnings supported billion in rwa growth in we executed billion of share repurchases as we continue to normalize excess capital additionally we announced a dividend of per share for the first quarter we remain disciplined in our capital allocation and currently maintain billion of cet1 in excess of our scb requirements our priority is to remain focused on maintaining prudent capital levels amid continued uncertainty while investing in our businesses and supporting our customers lets turn to slide to review asset quality trends consolidated net chargeoffs of basis points reflected the combination of normalization and seasonality comparisons to the prior year and prepandemic periods are influenced by the addition of unsecured lending which added basis points ill provide more color on retail auto credit shortly but trends remain generally inline with our expectations we are closely monitoring performance trends across the portfolio to inform tactical actions and risk tolerance as we continue to manage through credit normalization in the bottom right 30day delinquencies increased due to typical seasonality and have normalized back to levels 60day delinquencies are elevated versus given strategic shift in collection practices but we continue to see favorable total loss rates we expect continued increases in delinquencies and are closely monitoring consumer health and the impact of persistent inflation on spending and savings trends the investments weve made within servicing and collections over the past few years will enhance our ability to communicate with and support our customers slide shows that consolidated coverage increased basis point to primarily reflecting growth in our retail auto and unsecured lending portfolios total reserve increased to billion or billion higher than cecl day levels as we accounted for modest loan growth and the current macroeconomic outlook which has the unemployment rate approaching by yearend retail auto coverage of increased basis points quarteroverquarter and is basis points higher than cecl day total retail auto reserves at billion are up roughly million or versus cecl day slide provides a detailed view of originations dating back to bucketed into our proprietary credit tiers as a fullspectrum lender with critical scale we are able to opportunistically focus on market segments where we see the most value while supporting our dealer customers since originations from our top two tiers have remained consistent in the range while we slightly decrease our exposure to lower credit tiers our approach to riskbased pricing is evident on the right side of the page in total we added basis points of price in ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 which was intentionally added across the credit spectrum like some other lenders we werent able to add as much price into higher fico segments but we aggressively added price to higher risk tranches to buffer returns from losses that may exceed underwritten expectations the bottom of the page highlights a few originated stats showing our strategic shift toward used which has largely driven yield expansion despite stable credit origination trends over the past seven years on slide we show our forecast for used vehicle values which has remained largely consistent for the past months in we saw a decline from peak values most of which was realized during the second half of the year we are projecting a further decline of from current levels which will result in a total decline from to the end of consistent with previous guidance there are certainly other views on used values out there most of which are projecting smaller declines in while we do see the possibility for a smaller decline in based on the supply and demand dynamics at play we continue to maintain a conservative stance turning to slide we have added some details and what were seeing within the retail auto portfolio regarding vintage performance we have continued to see strong performance from vintages originated through mid2021 these loans have now passed their peak loss period and we expect lifetime losses to be favorable to price expectations we are seeing elevated delinquency and loss trends in the vintages originated from late through mid2022 consistent with what others have observed in the industry these vintages currently account for about of the portfolio and are just entering peak losses although we expect that cohort to amortize to about of the book by the end of this year we do expect elevated losses in those vintages to impact our full year net chargeoff rate as weve discussed previously we have been taking underwriting and pricing actions to reduce the risk content of new originations by the end of this year these latest originations will account for the majority of the portfolio and loss content heading into slide provides an update on retail autos net chargeoff expectations our net chargeoff outlook assumes a mild recession in along with a further decline in used values just discussed loss performance in december was consistent with what we expect on a normalized basis and we assume full normalization of the portfolio in first quarter of peak losses on the late and early vintages and increasing unemployment drive elevated losses late in the year and a fullyear net chargeoff rate of around the bottom of the slide provides perspective on how we currently expect losses to materialize throughout weve also included historical references which have shown similar seasonality overall expected losses are up approximately basis points from those periods and are slightly elevated relative to what wed expect for the normalized risk profile of our originations we expect to continue to be a very dynamic environment and well continue to be transparent about what were seeing in our current expectations for the year on slide weve laid out various actions weve taken throughout to mitigate risk on new originations and how were prepared to manage credit through the cycle by focusing on what we can control frontend actions including modifying decision strategy implementing pricing increments and curtailing risk help to ensure were originating loans at adequate riskadjusted returns maintaining appropriate staffing levels through the cycle and investing in digital capabilities proactively positions us to handle normalized credit conditions moving now to ally bank on slide retail deposits of billion increased billion quarteroverquarter reflecting continued growth and solid inflows from traditional banks total deposit balances of billion increased billion quarteroverquarter driven by incremental growth from broker deposits given the continued momentum across the deposit franchise were currently depositfunded we delivered our strongest quarter of customer growth since the second quarter of adding new customers in the fourth quarter our 55th consecutive quarter of growth since we founded ally bank balance growth and retention have been ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 foundational aspects of our retail deposit strategy we continue to lead the industry with a customer retention rate customer acquisition especially within younger generations is noteworthy the customer demographics in the bottom right highlight the longterm opportunity we have to deepen relationships by being part of our customers financial journey from the early stages turning to slide we continue to drive scale and diversification across our digital bank platforms deposits continue to serve as the primary gateway to our other banking products which enhance brand loyalty drive engagement and deepen customer relationships the strength of our brand allows us to build on current momentum across our newer consumer lending products ally invest continue to increase depth and strength of customer relationships at ally bank the percentage of new accounts opened by existing customers remains above card balances of billion are derived from million active customers reflecting our strategy of low and grow credit lines ally lending balances of billion highlights the momentum across healthcare and home improvement verticals and we continue to see balanced opportunity for accretive growth in these portfolios as they currently comprise less than of our earning assets lets turn to slide for the auto segment highlights pretax income of million was a result of continuing pricing actions as well as balanced growth within the retail and commercial auto offset by higher provision the increase in provision expense versus the prior year reflects historically loss performance in looking at the bottomleft originated retail auto yield of was up basis points from the prior quarter reflecting significant pricing actions as mentioned previously we put nearly basis points of price into the market in and are continuing to see solid flows with originated yields above this show further expansion of the portfolio yield and we expect this to continue over the mediumterm given the strength and scale of our franchise the bottom right shows lease portfolio trends despite the decline in used values gain per unit was up quarteroverquarter given the decline in lessee and dealer buyouts turning to slide we continue to realize the benefits of our leading agile platform underpinned by a hightech and hightouch model consistent application flow shown in the topleft enables us to be selective in what we approve and ultimately originate applications and approvals have been relatively stable over the past couple years but we did target as tickdown in approval rate as we proactively managed risk through detailed micro segment analysis in the upperright and in consumer assets of billion are up on a yearoveryear basis commercial balances ended at billion as new vehicle supply remains pressured but has shown some signs of normalization turning to origination trends on the bottomhalf of the page consumer auto volume of billion demonstrates our ability to add price in the market and maintain solid origination volume this culminated in fullyear originations of billion we remain nimble and are not tied to any target but we would expect to generate originations in the low billion range in lastly used accounted for of originations in the quarter while nonprime declined to of volume given ongoing risk management and seasonal trends turning to insurance results in slide core pretax income at million decreased yearoveryear from the impact of lower investment gains given the market backdrop total written premiums of million increased yearoveryear but still reflect headwinds from lower unit sales and inventory levels across the industry last quarter we shared some context on how our proactive approach and dealer relationships were able to limit losses related to hurricane ian we continue to see favorable results and expect minimal loss content as shown in the bottomleft chart going forward we remain focused on leveraging our significant dealer network and holistic offerings to drive further integration of insurance across auto finance turning to corporate finance on slide core income of million reflected disciplined growth in the portfolio and stable credit trends net financing revenue was driven by higher asset balances as well as higher benchmarks as the entire portfolio is floating rate the loan portfolio is diversified across industries with asset ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 based loans comprising of the portfolio and a firstlien position in virtually of exposures our billion hfi portfolio is up yearoveryear reflecting our expertise and disciplined growth within a highly competitive market mortgage details are on slide mortgage generated pretax income of million and million of dtc originations reflecting tighter margins on conforming production and effectively zero demand for refinancing activity mortgage is an important product for our customers who value a modern and seamless digital platform were focused on a great experience for our customers but refrain from any specific volume targets before closing ill share a few thoughts on the outlook for on slide we show key drivers of expected expense growth while headline expenses are projected to grow roughly its important to look a little closer at the details roughly half of the yearoveryear growth is comprised of nondiscretionary items including an industrywide increase in fdic fees and insurance expenses primarily commissions which have a direct offset in revenue and weather losses growth also includes increased costs to ensure were able to provide leading service to our customers support continued credit normalization and manage lost exposure the remaining increases in expenses consists of variable costs directly tied to revenue growth like servicing and acquisition costs in auto and card and longterm investment across the enterprise like cyber so what you traditionally think of as discretionary expenses are driving approximately or of expense growth in we acknowledge the revenue headwinds present this year and remained very focused on efficient expense deployment slide contains our financial outlook as we see it today clearly the dynamic environment makes it harder than ever to provide granular guidance but we remain committed to transparency based on what we know today we see adjusted eps of approximately in the main drivers of which include nim of which weve covered previously other revenue expanding to roughly million per quarter modest earning asset growth midsingle digit expense growth retail auto net chargeoffs of to and consolidated net chargeoffs of to and finally a tax rate in the to range slightly favorable versus our historic average given ongoing tax planning strategies weve also provided our thoughts on earnings trajectory beyond we expect earnings expansion over the next several years as nim moves past the trough and migrates toward based on what we know today we can see a path to that as early as but obviously several variables will ultimately dictate the pace of eps expansion we continue to view midteens as the return profile of the company based on all the structural enhancements weve made over the past several years we acknowledge will be a very dynamic year given macroeconomic headwinds and volatility but were confident in our ability to continue to execute and drive long term profitability and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you brad i thought i would close by highlighting several of my nearterm priorities first and foremost is credit risk as ive said before our ability to underwrite and manage credit risk is our core competency im confident the investments weve continued to make in risk management position us well to navigate this fluid environment the bar on cybersecurity risk management continues to move higher and were committed to protecting our customers from external threats im thankful for the talent of our cio and ciso and the broad cyber teams that exist at ally taking care of our people and maintaining a purposedriven culture is even more important during periods of heightened uncertainty our continued emphasis on essentialism will drive operating efficiencies over time while we are focused on tactfully navigating this dynamic environment in the nearterm ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 were committed to continuing to execute on our longterm priorities and finally we must live our name and be an ally now more than ever were going to support our dealer corporate finance and consumer bank customers staying true to our name and promise has driven our unique growth and retention of customers i remain incredibly proud to lead our company and over time im confident these priorities will serve us well and deliver value for all stakeholders i know the deck today was longer than normal but we thought it was important to really give that longerterm view and focus on the trends that weve executed on since we went public and also hit the things that are topofmind for all of you and topofmind for investors things like credit and margin so we tried to evolve the deck this time we know we added several pages but we thought that transparency was very important and with that sean back to you and we can head into qa sean leary headinvestor relations enterprise financial planning and analysis ally financial inc thank you jb as we head into qa we do ask that participants to limit yourself to one question and one follow up carmen please begin the qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions it comes from the line of moshe orenbuch with credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great and thanks for that extra disclosure just to drill in a little bit on the credit loss outlook and how we should think about it could you talk a little bit about the impact of frequency versus severity the period that you saw from the middle of to those originations what are you seeing thats driving that higher loss and how does that inform us just to the path in and for the overall loss rate bradley brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc hey good morning moshe its brad ill start on that one and jb can certainly add in as you mentioned we did highlight that kind of late early vintage from a frequency perspective we did see that kind of normalization pace accelerate in the fourth quarter and a couple of variables too that are important one as customers really get to that stage earlier in the cycle of the loan that is typically a higher balance at chargeoff was certainly impactful and then as well as noted we did see some acceleration in used car values in the late part of the year which were also impactful as we think forwardterm into here as i mentioned that vintage was about almost of the book at the end of the year as that continues to normalize it will work that through the system here in and i think that that will as we mentioned be impactful to the rate that we highlight as well but then at the same time weve taken as noted significant actions tactically around risk management and trimming some of the risks that ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 we see particularly around micro segmentation which has really reduced the loss expectations on that more recent book and then couple that with the really strong outperforming back book really kind of gives us comfort there in terms of that range and then ultimately the macro environment is certainly impactful as mentioned this does assume we are assuming a mild recession in thats really led by contraction in gdp for the first couple of quarters and then ultimately unemployment getting near by the end of moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and the margin outlook is roughly consistent with where you had been although rates have moved up a little bit more what has countered that has it been the yield on auto i mean i think your performance this quarter was a little better than we had been expecting can you talk a little bit about what drove how we should think about whats happened on the yield side i guess bradley brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure well id go back to all the enhancements that jb highlighted at the beginning structurally that is continuing to be a significant part of the expansion just generally from an overall company and balance sheet perspective i would say that retail portfolio yields continues to expand i think that those levels i think have been a little bit underestimated as well and i think again putting on good solid business at yields high during the fourth quarter was also impactful and then you think about things like the hedges that we have which really do provide a nice bridge for us as you think about the increase in fed funds in the fourth quarter basis points was dramatic so that did reprice the osa portfolio as we also highlighted but the hedges really do kind of help us bridge the through really most of to kind of give time for the retail auto portfolio needle to really overwhelm the increase in liability costs jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah the only thing moshe maybe i would add just a couple of things on its really slide we didnt spend a ton of time drilling into the what we did in the quarter but youll see auto originations we pared back fairly considerably in the fourth quarter from where we had been running and id say that was probably driven in twofold one just being ever more deliberate on credit management and as brad talked about trimming some of those micro segments and things like that but you also saw a decent pop in what we were doing in the new space and part of this we just think is a function and i talked about it at one of the industry conferences in december you get to kind of a pay per yield on new consumer originations we hit a bit of a saturation point with the consumers so part of that all those factors sort of drove into kind of lower volumes and maybe a little less risk appetite in the fourth quarter as well operator thank you one moment for our next question and it comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs please proceed ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys and thanks for all the additional disclosure brad to moshes question you outlined what you expect to drive credit losses in the nearterm can you maybe just expand upon whats included in the ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 allowance from a macro perspective i know you said of unemployment by the end of the year and just how are you thinking about future reserve builds here given the fact that you are expecting a modest recession in the nearterm thanks bradley brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc yes hey good morning ryan sure so i guess id start by saying we did mention the macroeconomic it certainly has evolved since third quarter and we pointed it out and you did as well gdp contraction as well as higher unemployment by the end of the year approaching id start with by saying we and jb pointed this out we continue to be really generally conservative in our overall reserving methodology that includes the assumptions that we make in our cecl framework as well when you think about our 12month supportable and then the 24month reversion as well and the lookback there which includes the great recession so kind of getting to that kind of reversion mean of in unemployment so when we kind of think about coverage versus that range of to and my kind of simple broad math when you think about even the highend of that range if you allocate that annualized number over our weighted average life of auto which is months or so you would see that were really wellcovered even at the higher end of that range ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for the color and then jb maybe a question for you on capital so the slides note that you dont expect to repurchase any shares here and given slower than last years balance sheet growth i think its pretty clear youre going to build capital this year so maybe can you just talk about given the uncertainty in the environment where youd like to run capital ratios at and then maybe what would it take for you to turn repurchases for the company back on thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah sure ryan so its kind of we alluded to were close to sort of running at our internal target which is ish and so weve been aggressive buyers of the shares got ourselves paying a reasonable dividend today i think just in light of what a fluid environment dynamic environment challenging whatever you want to call it we think the prudent thing right now is not to plan for incremental buybacks but to the extent we get clarity to the extent whatever we head into and it becomes a mild recession and we start generating incremental capital i think wed look to restart the buyback program at some point in the future and so that was using that word currently was very much by design i mean i think what we see today the prudent thing is to not plan for it but look i think weve shown we are aggressive buyers of our shares when we feel theyre undervalued and we certainly would say that today and so to the extent we get more and better clarity it would not be unreasonable to assume we begin again operator thank you one moment for our next question please and it comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 thanks good morning your presentation materials go a long way towards addressing some of the major debates on your stock so let me add my thanks i wanted to follow up on your credit comments based on what you see today would you expect ncos to peak in or could we see peak ncos going out until and when should we expect the reserve rate to start to drift lower in relation to those peak losses bradley brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc yes hey good morning bill sure so i think the slide that we added that shows sort of that expected trajectory in is a great reference point and youll see kind of at most the biggest delta in sort of our normalized view versus expectations really is in the fourth quarter and so thats where the unemployment rate as i said is peaking cresting as well as that working through some of the other dynamics we mentioned in terms of just when you think about the content of new originations as well the vintage the dynamic that i mentioned which is really working through that late early cohorts where we expect that to be down to less than a quarter of the book by the fourth quarter so i think that that and also kind of continuing what weve guided to previously around our decline in used vehicle values it will kind of get us to that high point of the now if things worsen or things change from here i mean variables as i mentioned are moving quickly and certainly hard to predict but we see that there could be some of that elevation going into but really feel like given all of those dynamics that that should be around the top of peak bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and separately i did want to also ask if you could give some color on the decision to provide concrete expense guidance and speak to the concerns that is a long way away and you may be limiting your flexibility why not go with more of an efficiency ratio that gives you the ability to potentially manage expenses for the revenue environment just any kind of color and the thought process that you all went through there jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah i mean bill what i would say is look across the enterprise we embrace this essentialism mindset which is disciplined pursuit of less there are a number of the items that are sort of noncontrollable that i think brad pointed out fdic fees being a big driver the insurance line item creates a decent size pop in your headline expense number but as brad mentioned in his prepared remarks thats the direct offset in revenues there and so then when you get into kind of a controllable space you got a number of to which we think in light of the environment is pretty reasonable i mean as i talked to other ceos in financial services i think everyones kind of grappling with higher people cost and human capital cost and so were trying to manage through that what i would say is as an enterprise in the end of the summer last year we more or less hit the pause on hiring youve seen other financials do that as well i would say there are some special exceptions to that new talent entrylevel talent you want to continue to build a pipeline and allow those people to come into the company that doesnt end up being a big driver of expenses but weve added to the head count there and then with respect to the technology space and cyber space and things like that we think these are areas where you have to constantly invest in and we think its kind of interesting whats going on in the world of technology more layoff announcements throughout this week more this morning and that may provide us an opportunity to bring in incremental talent so all these things kind of balance out the way were thinking through i ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 mean we recognize revenues as brad talked about are going to be pressured in the nearterm but i think our focus is trying to create that right balance for the long run and i think what weve done in hiring has been very responsible and very disciplined and what i think our longterm holders would expect us to be doing but i mean id start with there is a big essentialism push to drive efficiencies wherever we can operator thank you and one moment for our last question and it comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hi betsy bradley brown a corporate treasurer interim chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions one just wanted to dig in a little bit on the guide for how youre thinking about the osa rate and the nim and all that and i know that you indicated there were several different scenarios and a range of potential outcomes so can you help us understand how youre thinking about working through the scenario where perhaps osa rate becomes a little more competitive than what youre baking into the baseline that youve got here jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah betsy ill start and brad feel free to dive in so what i would say certainly the direct bank market has been hypercompetitive as of late i think theres a bigger thirst for deposits so we take the point i think where were priced at right now at on osa is inline with what i would say are other kind of topname direct banks and big banks and so were kind of right inline with the pack there are certain names that are priced higher than us and were not seeing big outflows and so all this ends up being kind of a balancing act on the competitive environment and the rate environment i think the guide that brad tried to point out is i mean i think most of the universe is starting to think that the fed is getting closer to being done maybe theres another basis points to go and obviously i mean were at today brad has shown you a scenario where youre going up basis points against maybe a 50basis point move so its kind of like a beta that feels pretty darn aggressive to me so it is about indiscernible thats why we try to add the transparency about what youre assuming on the fed funds rate everyone can kind of do their own math if they think it would go higher but the nice thing i would say in talking to our deposit leader anand talwar and our bank leader diane morais they would say things had kind of felt a little bit more stable here the past three four weeks so we think theres more to go but i dont think its another kind of basis points from here ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it and then separately same kind of theme how should we think about the impact on loss rates if used car prices fall more sharply than what you have baked in jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah i mean obviously they go up to some degree but i think there are a couple of dynamics at play first if you look at other industry experts and big names that are out there they are more modest in the declines that theyve projected i think weve been pretty consistent in saying end of to the end of would be this 30ish types of line we saw a little more than that last year but as brad has shown you youve got probably basis points of decline embedded here i think the other factor and whats out there is there were about million less cars produced over the past sort of three years and so we think that provides some structural support we always try to take a more conservative view but i mean the way i would think about the range of risk is maybe if another decline in used car prices and that would represent kind of a couple basis points of incremental nco so its fairly well in there yes could it be worse but we think thats probably a little bit unlikely from here betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great
