given the continued changes in market interest rates margin pressures are more severe from a few months ago well discuss that in detail as we navigate the presentation deck while the bank funding market has been relatively stable since the events of midmarch we continue to hold a conservative liquidity posture anchored by our leading deposits franchise retail deposits were up nearly billion despite seasonal headwinds related to tax payments and a host of other factors pressuring deposit flows insured balances increased billion in the quarter and now represent of the portfolio total available liquidity of billion was effectively flat quarteroverquarter and is equivalent to times our uninsured deposit balances cet1 ended the quarter at and exceeds our regulatory minimum by billion operational performance in the quarter was steady across the company within auto finance million applications powered us to generate billion of originations at attractive riskadjusted returns we highlighted this last quarter but i want to reiterate that we see around billion of potential originations in any given quarter allowing us to be selective in what we book to the balance sheet net chargeoffs in the quarter were basis points which was down from prior quarter but was slightly elevated relative to expectations brad will talk more about the second quarter loss performance and our outlook for the rest of the year within insurance we continue to successfully grow and deepen dealer relationships as million of written premiums were up yearoveryear turning to ally bank total deposits of billion are up billion yearoveryear as we continue to grow our deposit customer base now approaching million we have over million active credit cardholders and remain excited about longterm opportunities for this business weve launched our one ally digital experience and expect to complete the full rebranding of ally credit card later this year corporate finance continues to deliver accretive disciplined growth as nearly of the billion portfolio is in a first lien position ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 turning to slide number i remain incredibly proud of the culture weve established and its critical to our success as we navigate periods of uncertainty culture has always been a top priority for me and we continue to see tangible impacts from our efforts our teammates provide diverse perspectives and contributions and our leadership team is focused on maintaining strong engagement across every level of the organization we recently completed another company engagement survey and im proud that we remained in the top of global companies and were points higher than the financial services benchmark we remain focused on being a source of strength for consumer commercial and dealer customers yeartodate customer obsession has resulted in satisfaction scores of nearly and customer retention of stronger communities mean a stronger ally and we were thrilled to recently announce nearly billion in giving and lending support for affordable housing initiatives im proud of allys ability to make a difference in home affordability which remains a key challenge in many communities our culture is authentic unique and a key differentiator in delivering longterm results on slide number we wanted to directly address some of the critical items were navigating today this is a unique time in the industry and our company and im confident in our leadership team and teammates who have successfully navigated numerous challenging environments before from an interest rate perspective weve talked for multiple quarters about the nearterm challenges of a rapidly rising interest rate environment operationally throughout the cycle the businesses have been discipline in managing pricing on both sides of the balance sheet weve also utilized our strong alco processes including an active hedging program to protect the company from higherforlonger rates scenarios beyond the nearterm pressure the momentum we have on the asset side of the balance sheet positions us well for margin expansion when rates stabilize inflation data we saw last week shows that policy may be working to slow pressures and obviously that will be a significant positive for us going forward managing credit risk continues to remain a top priority weve refined our buybox to eliminate underperforming segments and add significant price particularly in riskier segments to compensate for potential volatility based on where we see things to date wed expect retail auto ncos of for the full year which is in line with the range we provided in january this is unique environment where unemployment remains historically low however persistent inflation is a challenge for many consumers delinquencies remain a watch item and remain elevated entering the second half of the year and consistent with prior guides we assume a meaningful step down in used vehicle values for the remainder of the year the team weve built and the investments weve made in collections and servicing will drive solid performance even in a challenging environment on the regulatory front were preparing for increased capital and liquidity across the industry and expect category iv banks are likely to see requirements more like those of the gsibs at some point in the future i wont advocate whether or not that is appropriate as i firmly believe tailoring works but i think we are being realistic in our thoughts for the future were well positioned from a liquidity standpoint and were building capital to prepare for these expected changes we maintain constructive working relationships with the regulatory community and look forward to clarity on potential changes in the regulatory framework understandably though theres a lot of focus on nearterm pressures and potential for increased regulation overall i feel strongly the company is well positioned to deliver earnings growth over the next several years and as rates turn we are more uniquely positioned to benefit than most in the industry lets turn to slide number where weve highlighted the strength of our marketleading consumer deposit franchise since ally banks inception in weve continued to provide customers not just another bank offering but rather a better approach to banking our seamless digital customer experience has resonated as ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 were now approaching million retail deposit customers millennial and younger demographics represent most of our growth which highlights the opportunity ahead given the construct of our consumer deposit portfolio of deposits are fdic insured among the highest levels in the industry and customer retention of continues to demonstrate the loyalty of our customers once theyve opened an ally account and experience our customer centric digital approach weve recently received recognition from the wall street journal for being their favorite online bank again another positive recognition to our approach to banking moving to slide number we provided a snapshot of our current funding stack and available liquidity were core funded with deposits as they comprise of our funding but importantly we have multiple sources of liquidity beyond deposits in fact over the past three months weve accessed every one of our nondeposit funding sources including public secured and unsecured debt transactions we were the first category iv bank to issue unsecured debt since the events of march and the transaction which was tlac eligible was very well received demonstrating confidence in our financial profile on the right side we show total available liquidity of billion representing times uninsured deposit balances and for context cash on hand at quarter end represented over of our uninsured deposit balances while markets have been mostly calm in recent months we know that can change quickly and we felt it was appropriate to highlight the strength and resilience of the liquidity footprint again this quarter and with that ill turn it over to brad to cover our detailed financial results bradley j brown corporate treasurer ally financial inc thank you jb good morning everyone ill begin on slide net financing revenue excluding oid of billion was down yearoveryear driven by higher funding costs given the rapid increase in shortterm rates as liquid savings products comprise the majority of our consumer deposits portfolio partially offset by higher earning asset yields given the strengthened auto pricing increased floating rate assets our hedging program and growth across unsecured products adjusted other revenue of million increased yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter reflecting momentum across our insurance and smartauction businesses we see a path for expanding other revenue across the back half of moving towards a million quarterly run rate provision expense of million was down quarteroverquarter reflecting seasonal trends and a modest reserve build ill provide more granular commentary on chargeoff trends shortly noninterest expense of billion reflects the highest second quarter weather losses realized since in addition to disciplined investments across technology and variable servicing and collection costs despite elevated weather losses yearoveryear growth in total expenses declined relative to the first quarter we expect favorable yearoveryear expense trends as we progress through the second half of gaap and adjusted eps for the quarter were and respectively moving to slide net interest margin excluding oid of was generally in line with expectations down basis points quarteroverquarter we see momentum within earning asset yields but the increase in shortterm rates will continue to pressure cost of funds as we discussed previously we continue to maintain a conservative liquidity position including elevated cash balances all of this pressured margin by a few basis points in the quarter we believe this is a prudent tradeoff in the current environment our longerterm view of nim trajectory is largely unchanged but given the rate environment we currently see full year nim around ill share more detail on nim dynamics and outlook shortly ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 our approach to underwriting and focus on riskadjusted returns slightly lowered our retail originated yield this quarter as we continue to originate loans in the mid10 range we see significant tailwinds in future periods as more recent originations comprise a growing share of the overall portfolio total average loans and leases of billion are up billion yearoveryear driven by growth within retail auto and a gradual normalization of commercial auto balances quarteroverquarter growth of less than billion reflects our focus on disciplined capital deployment earning asset yield of increased basis points quarteroverquarter and nearly basis points year overyear given the cumulative impact of trends as discussed previously including retail auto portfolio yield expansion the increasing contribution from higher yielding assets and over billion of floating rate exposure across our commercial loan and hedging portfolios partially offset by our maintenance of elevated cash levels mentioned previously retail portfolio yield expanded basis points from the prior quarter as recent vintages comprise a larger portion of the portfolio at quarter end nearly of the portfolio consisted of loans originated since when the tightening cycle commenced concurrently weve added basis points of price which will provide significant tailwinds in future periods and our hedging program continues to provide incremental benefit to the retail auto portfolio yield commercial portfolio yields expanded alongside benchmark rates given their floating rate nature turning to liabilities cost of funds increased basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points yearover year the increase in deposit cost reflects continued increases in shortterm rates and a highly competitive market for deposits on slide we provide an updated view of our expectations for retail auto and deposit pricing the two largest drivers of our margin trajectory our current expectation for full year nim of around is based on the forward curve which now assumes peak fed funds of and no rate cuts until despite this pressure we remain confident in the underlying momentum which will lead to nim expansion in future periods retail auto portfolio yield expanded again this quarter as we continue to originate well above the overall portfolio yield originated yield declined in the quarter as weve increased the superprime proportion of our volume disruption in the market has enabled us to capture superprime share with minimal change in price returns in this segment are significantly higher than normal and weve taken the opportunity to optimize riskadjusted returns this shift demonstrates the benefit of our scale and ability to adapt to market conditions current originations are still well above portfolio yields which will drive portfolio yield to by yearend deposit pricing reflects a dynamic environment with banks competing with each other and investment alternatives to capture deposits we expect the retail deposits portfolio yield to continue migrating toward current liquid savings rates clearly there are a range of possible outcomes given the current backdrop but we remain confident in our balance sheet positioning and corresponding nim trajectory and while weve seen pressure to our full year nim outlook we see a steady migration up to over time even without the benefit of rate cuts moving to slide our cet1 ratio increased quarteroverquarter to given our disciplined approach to capital allocation we announced another quarterly common dividend of for the third quarter and loan growth will be modest and focused on attractive riskadjusted returns at current levels we exceed our regulatory minimum for cet1 by billion while ally was not subject to this years dfast exercise our stress capital buffer remains unchanged at the minimum ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 the bottomright provides our current tce ratio and a pro forma view of cet1 in the unlikely scenario where the aoci filter is fully removed even without the expected benefit of a gradual phased in pro forma cet1 of is in line with our regulatory minimum and is expected to increase naturally as a reminder nearly all of our securities portfolio is held in afs meaning we dont have a large unrealized loss sitting in held to maturity and we have continued to allow the securities portfolio to roll down with minimal reinvestment over the past months lets turn to slide to review asset quality trends consolidated net chargeoffs of basis points were down quarteroverquarter as we saw typical seasonal trends partially offset by a specific chargeoff within corporate finance the chargeoff within corporate finance added basis points to the consolidated rate this exposure was fully reserved for previously and did not impact provision expense in the quarter retail auto net chargeoffs of basis points were down versus the prior quarter but slightly higher than prior guidance we continue to see mostly offsetting impacts of elevated loss frequency and favorable severity benefiting from higher used values ill cover retail auto chargeoffs in more detail shortly in the bottomright 30day delinquencies increased basis points quarteroverquarter more specifically the 30day delinquency rate rose less than we typically see in a normalized environment delinquencies will increase seasonally throughout the second half of and we continue to assess the impact of inflation but the investments weve made will support our ability to communicate with consumers and mitigate losses slide shows that consolidated coverage declined basis points to given the release of specific reserves related to the corporate finance chargeoff mentioned previously the total reserve balance at billion was flat quarteroverquarter and is billion higher than cecl day our macro assumption deployment conditions with unemployment reaching next year before increasing to approximately under our reversion to historical mean methodology retail auto coverage increased basis points to and remains well above the on cecl day the remaining weighted average life of our retail auto portfolio remains under two years demonstrating the coverage we have for expected lifetime losses of this portfolio on slide we share our credit trends weve seen so far through june and our outlook for the year as noted previously we ended the quarter with ncos of which were slightly elevated versus expectations the drivers of this increase are consistent with the themes we talked about today and on our prior earnings call delinquencies entering the quarter were elevated as we did not see the typical seasonal decline coming out of tax refund season earlier this year flowtoloss rates remain stable and favorable to prepandemic levels but we did see elevated loss frequency late in the quarter those losses occurred at the same time the industry saw several weeks of declining wholesale vehicle values which further added to the pressure through the end of the quarter while delinquencies remain a watch item we saw the smallest second quarter increase in 30day delinquencies since the pandemic and yearoveryear increases continue to decline used vehicle values are a driver of loss severity and we feel our assumed decline in the second half of the year is appropriately conservative on the bottomleft weve again provided quarterly loss expectations which result in a full year loss rate of around on the right side weve included a summary of some of the key underwriting decisions weve made as we leverage detailed segmentation and analytics to optimize our riskadjusted returns slide provides our latest view for used vehicle values given performance yeartodate which saw values increase we are currently forecasting a decline in values across the back half of which would result in a full year decline of roughly in line with what we shared last quarter beyond we expect elevated values relative to prepandemic levels given the constraint on used vehicle supply ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call

consumer relationships ally invest complements the deposit franchise well as of new accounts were from existing customers as they leverage the ease of money movement between accounts within ally ally

opportunities to prudently market to the existing ally customer base ally lending is focused on deepening merchant relationships within home improvement and healthcare verticals like the ally credit card our disciplined approach to underwriting and capital allocation resulted in modest growth quarteroverquarter lets move to slide to cover auto segment results pretax income of million reflected pricing momentum alongside higher provision expense on the bottomleft we highlight the intentional shift we made in our origination profile over the past several months uncertainty in the market has caused a number of lenders to reduce or exit their position in the marketplace creating an opportunity for ally to win incremental business our strategy to drive overall application volume and increase the top of the funnel enables us to see the entire market and focus on riskadjusted returns the bottomright chart summarizes lease termination trends while used values declined from march to june average auction proceeds were slightly favorable quarteroverquarter a higher number of lease terminations in the period also led to an increase in remarketing gains versus the prior quarter slide highlights a few ways in which the auto business continues to evolve and develop in order to serve our dealer customers even better while driving attractive economics for ally smartauction is our webbased auction platform that enables dealertodealer transactions generating fee revenue for ally while providing realtime data on market pricing and trends despite a meaningful reduction in industry volume smartauction revenue is projected to be up more than versus and unit volume up more than since just last year we see tremendous opportunity to leverage our platform for additional white label relationships providing efficient incremental revenue on the right side of the slide we highlight passthrough program revenue given our strategy to drive increased application volume mentioned above we now see more than million applications per month allowing us to be selective and maximize riskadjusted returns for certain loans that do not meet our underwriting criteria we route those application to relationship partners ally receives the fee for the origination and services of loans allowing us to generate efficient revenue while leveraging the scale of our servicing platform both initiatives represent opportunity to further expand allys other revenue and demonstrate the strength and breadth of the auto finance franchise turning to slide our unique scale and deep dealer relationships allow ally to engage in and support ev adoption as the market develops originations of million are up yearoveryear and represent our single highest quarter of ev originations demonstrating our reach in the marketplace consumer ev portfolio balance of billion is diversified across lease in retail and oems and consists of plugin hybrid and battery electric ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 vehicles as weve highlighted previously the synergies between auto and insurance are a competitive advantage for ally and benefit our dealer and consumer customers in october of last year we introduced a new insurance product designed specifically to cover plugin hybrids and battery electric vehicles our approach to evs is consistent with our overall auto strategy to adapt to changing environments focus on our core strengths and drive accretive returns allys history of financing evs goes back more than years and we remain well positioned to support dealers and customers as consumer preferences evolve and ev adoption grows turning to slide we remain focused on leveraging our differentiated gotomarket approach coupling high tech and hightouch which has generated significant scale and a competitive advantage applications volume of million and approval rate reflects the selective way in which we deploy capital ending assets in the top right were up slightly quarteroverquarter as commercial balances gradually increase alongside modest growth in retail auto originations of billion on the bottom of the page display the scale of our franchise and the compelling volume were able to generate despite tighter underwriting criteria yeartodate nearly billion of origination volume puts us on track to originate around billion this year additionally used comprised of originations which was flat quarteroverquarter as we progressed through the typical used vehicle selling season and down percentage points yearoveryear given the underwriting actions weve taken in recent quarters nonprime represented just under of retail originations in the quarter turning to insurance on slide a core pretax loss of million was a result of seasonally higher weather losses along with normalization of gap losses given decline in used car values keep in mind we do have reinsurance in place for weather losses to limit our total exposure but following several years of favorability we saw weather activity more in line with historical averages written premiums of million increased yearoveryear as we remained focused on increasing dealer relationships and benefit from normalizing inventory levels as a result of the momentum in written premiums earned premiums were up million yearoveryear with further expansion ahead our focus remains on leveraging the scale weve established in auto finance and highlighting our full spectrum product suite to dealers driving further integration of insurance across our auto dealer base corporate finance results are on slide core pretax income of million reflected disciplined portfolio growth and the benefit of higher interest rates given the entire portfolio is floating rate the chargeoff referenced earlier resulted from the vertical we no longer originate and didnt impact second quarter results given specific reserves posted in prior periods the portfolio remains high quality with roughly asset based and effectively of loans are in a first lien position hfi portfolio balance of billion has remained relatively flat yeartodate with modest growth expected to the rest of the year reflecting the teams discipline and focus on maximizing risk adjusted returns slide includes details for mortgage mortgage generated pretax income of million and million of dtc originations were not tied to any specific origination target and instead remain focused on a great experience for customers and have considerably reduced the expense flow to the business in light of market conditions slide contains our financial outlook for the operating environment remains dynamic and despite the difficulty in providing granular guidance weve continued the transparent approach weve taken over the past ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 several quarters as weve highlighted previously our guidance is based on expectations for interest rates specifically fed funds which continue to change rapidly at the end of the first quarter the market was expecting a peak fed funds of followed quickly by rate cuts with fed funds ending the year at at the end of the second quarter the market expected fed funds of through yearend a full basis points higher than previously expected given the naturally liability sensitive nature of our balance sheet that will put incremental pressure on nim and see full year nim of around or basis points lower than our previous expectations our expectation for full year other revenue is closer to billion mainly due to some of the onetime items we recorded earlier this year but we remain confident in our ability to get to that billion annual figure as we covered previously retail auto portfolio yield is still projected around while funding costs have moved up given the changes in benchmark rates and the intense competition for deposits retail ncos are expected to be at for the full year and no change to operating expense as we limit spend to nondiscretionary cost or essential investments we see the tax rate closer to for the year as weve had solid momentum in generating ev tax credits and expect that trend to continue while elevated and increasing interest rates are a headwind we expect most of the tightening cycle is behind us and have positioned the balance sheet through margin and earnings growth over the mediumterm and remain confident in our ability to continue to execute and drive longterm profitability and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you brad the strategic priorities which guide everything we do are unwavering and essential for our longterm success first and foremost is ensuring we maintain strong alignment between our culture and our stakeholders were focused on highlighting the differentiated offerings across our businesses for both consumer and commercial customers well continue finding ways

and capital allocation i remain incredibly proud to lead our company and over time im confident these priorities will help us deliver value for all stakeholders before i close i want to take a minute to thank brad for the exceptional job he has done serving as both the interim cfo and corporate treasurer over the past nine months that would have been a huge task in a normal operating environment and the last nine months have been anything but that brad seamlessly expanded his responsibility to lead the entire finance organization and the team continued to excel in everything they do brad thank you on behalf of the entire company and with that sean ill turn it back to you and head into qa sean leary headinvestor relations enterprise financial planning and analysis ally financial inc thank you jb as we head into qa we do ask that participants to limit yourself to one question and one follow up carmen please begin the qa ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please proceed sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning appreciate all the commentary maybe we could just dive into the nim migration next year i think brad you mentioned you see a path to the could you just talk about timing of how we get there obviously it sounds like you guys are able to go up market and i assume that that has an impact on the yield but it also should have a better impact on provision so maybe you can just talk about those moving dynamics there and maybe riskadjusted margins as well bradley j brown a corporate treasurer ally financial inc sure yeah good morning sanjay so a couple of things as we called out the two biggest drivers of that trajectory being the retail auto portfolio yield which you highlighted as well as really cost of funds pressure that weve experienced given the continued volatility and certainly increase weve seen in shortterm rates all of that to say that those dynamics have really led us to get down to that sort of for full year and then a couple of things i would mention just around you highlighted it as well around what weve been able to really pass through from a retail auto yield perspective theyre balancing riskadjusted returns which again are at historical highs in terms of what we continue to see there and the balanced approach weve taken around maintaining those riskadjusted yields and certainly loss content or expected loss content as well and then on the cost of funds side again just continued volatility in shortterm rates from an overall deposit pricing perspective which is the biggest driver there we feel like when you look at the performance that weve had over the first half of the year were very pleased with overall when you consider a number of things one the shortterm rates of course and we highlighted the intense competition for deposits both among banks but with alternative investments as well being so attractive a dynamic there in banks i mean one of our promise has always been that direct banks will have a competitive advantage given the rate that we pay weve seen a pretty big pivot in terms of aggression really across the industry on rates paid on deposits so that certainly has put pressure on those rates but when you think about ally more specifically when you look at the first half weve grown record customers in the first quarter we grew another this quarter if thats not a record for first half its certainly second best ever at the same time weve grown balances and retention and engagement remain very high all of this in not being or really lagging at least certainly the top five payers on liquid products so all that to say once we get past the peak in fed funds and they pause we will expand margins from there maybe a quarter or two later when you go into full year thats when we really expect to see that margin expansion which will be a primary driver of that longterm trajectory of profitability thank you sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then maybe you can just help us think about like reserve coverage on a goforward basis because you do have the higher losses but the delinquency rate seems to be trending in a positive direction and ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 then you might have a more favorable mix shift maybe you can just help us think about the reserve coverage going forward bradley j brown a corporate treasurer ally financial inc sure yeah and you saw us take that up a little bit in retail auto by a couple basis points this quarter and i think thats really directionally when we think about the activity in the actuals that we saw in the second quarter we entered the second quarter as we talked about with elevated delinquencies the seasonal decline that we expected in first quarter we didnt see as much but we did see an increase less than expected here in the second quarter and so were also really navigating that with this backdrop of persistent inflation and just higher demands in financial obligations for customers and couple that with potential higher loss frequency weve talked indiscernible that in our assumptions there all of those dynamics together kind of lead us toward that for full year so when you think about that we dont see a significant coverage anticipating coverage for retail auto certainly as the biggest driver given those dynamics and then again that is supported through the months reasonable and supportable forecast that we have and then a reversion to the historical mean from there sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you bradley j brown a corporate treasurer ally financial inc thanks sanjay operator thank you one moment for our next question please one moment please all right and it comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah hi this is jeff adelson on for betsy good morning jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hi jeff good morning bradley j brown a corporate treasurer ally financial inc good morning jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah so just wanted to dig into the nim trajectory a little bit more it seems like youre looking for the back half of the year nim to kind of hold steady to maybe a little bit lower from here just wanted to maybe dig into the components a little bit more and how we should be thinking about the trajectory of your deposit funding i know you have the osa at about today your oneyear cd is about and i realize youre guiding to an osa of ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 about but just given that the competition is already above that today one of your competitors just raised today just wondering how youre thinking about offsetting funding cost and maybe how we should be thinking about higherforlonger rate environment into bradley j brown a corporate treasurer ally financial inc yeah sure jeff ill take that so i guess from a deposit pricing perspective i know i say we are at if you kind of look at how weve kind of priced through the journey here in the tightening cycle right we expected the market does another hike next week so when you think about what i would say as we anticipate that fed hike in our guidance that we provided right we that certainly is factored in as well and then all the other elements that i talked about as well in terms of intense competition just continued pressure on rates all of those are embedded in that balance as well and then importantly we expect the portfolio yield will migrate toward as i said the liquid rates that were paying as well so thats the deposit pricing side which is a huge driver now to your point weve also been highlighting the fact that this nearterm pressure one of the things that weve been doing is really positioning the balance sheet where we can by converting or swapping fixed assets to floating that really is a significant benefit to us particularly as the bridge to help mitigate some of this pressure nearterm for example its probably million or so just in nii this quarter which also translate to significant benefit to nim the sculpting of notional really does help here until sort of early or so so to me that also is embedded in the guidance of us in terms of the longerterm nim view as well jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc jeff i think youve got it ballpark right i mean we see sort of trough in nim approaching some point later this year and i think as brad mentioned in his response to sanjay i think a quarter or two after the fed is done and we can all guess when thats going to be youll start to see pretty rapid margin expansion and then to the extent you get eases that really starts to accelerate but i think your timing around youre getting closer to sort of a bottom is spot on jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thats helpful and if we think about the credit outlook from here appreciate the updated color on the trajectory from here do you have an update on how youre maybe thinking about as were sitting here almost six months away i know before you talked about getting that back down to a retail auto loss rate of and how are you thinking about that and maybe relative to the prior update you had given us on the second half early vintage performing better than the prioryear vintage are you still seeing that or is there an update there bradley j brown a corporate treasurer ally financial inc sure so ill start so i guess just it as relates to the our expectations around auto nco so you did see us kind of guide out to the higher end of the range here for this year i think a number of things obviously are dependent there right in terms of obviously the macros and certainly where they go i think that one of the ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 things that we highlighted in the earnings presentation was this sort of slowing both quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear increase in delinquencies and net chargeoff trajectory as well i think some of thats factored in as we continue to migrate through here and into and then to your point those sort of earlier lets say more front book type of vintages have been more of an impact in terms of what were seeing both on those elevated delinquencies as well as ultimate chargeoffs and so those also are drivers and we kind of spelled out where we see those vintages reaching their peak loss periods all of that to say given the guide that weve given for we would see some of that most likely bleed into as well given those dynamics and then we cant lose sight of the fact that riskadjusted returns are again higher than ever and when you think about the underwriting actions that weve taken to tighten and all the dynamics there coupled with the investments we continue to make in servicing and collections we feel pretty balanced about how were teed up to navigate the rest of this year and certainly again continued upon the macro backdrop shifting jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc and i think on that pricing power point the other thing is look the competitive environment right now for us is pretty sweet i mean youve seen a number of players decide that they want to exit auto lending and so that makes for a pretty rich set for us i think obviously with respect to chase im sure you looked at their originations last week i think quarteroverquarter they were up in the neighborhood of so theyre still for people that are in and committed like chase like capital one like ourselves its still a very attractive market opportunity at very aggressive returns right now so we recognize credit may be a little bumpier than expected but the roes that were putting on are pretty much at lifetime highs for the company and so we like the business you got to have scale and i think for the players that are consistently there its a really attractive market for us jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks for taking my questions operator thank you one moment for our next question please all right and it comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc hey good morning ryan bradley j brown a corporate treasurer ally financial inc good

little bit of a step down in the back half of the year and i think you guys mentioned a little bit more of a harder look at costs can you maybe just talk about some of the drivers of the step down ex the weatherrelated insurance costs and given the potential for slower earning asset growth could we see expense growth start to flatten out in the coming quarters jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah ryan i think youre spot on so first the trajectory on the first half of the year is definitely richer than what we see on the back half of the year and i think the past three months the entire leadership team has really appropriately responded to the message of clamping down on all fronts and in fact largely outside of kind of new hires and new interns and oneoffs here and there weve effectively paused hiring as a corporation theres not a hard mandate per se but i think theres a very high hurdle rate to bring on new talent into the company right now and so we see the back half trajectory this year being much different than what we experienced for the first six months of this year and so that starts to get you back in line with the overall expense guide that brad gave and then i think the message into which clearly on the analyst communitys minds is going to be a much different trajectory i mean weve supported a lot of growth theyve been in smart areas like technology and brand and continued hiring in the company i think just recognizing the environment were in its going to be a much different story entering and yeah there are uncontrollable things like you alluded to fdic fees and things like that but i think the controllables the things that are within our power expect a very different expense trajectory out of the company going forward ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and maybe as a followup i think brad highlighted the adjusted capital ratio being around jb or brad can you maybe just talk about how you expect to manage capital over the mediumterm just given the need to get back to this lets call it 9percentplus level and maybe is there any optimization strategies across the balance sheet that you could potentially pursue to get capital back towards your targeted levels thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah ryan so ill start brad feel free or russ feel free to dive in i think one we showed that kind of fully phased in as just the draconian view i think the reality is were hearing anywhere from two years to five years as an appropriate phase in and so were waiting to see but i think our point was look even if you jam this down our throats on day one were already basically at the regulatory minimum so theres not a problem per se and theres not a need to go do anything out of line and i think that important reminder that brad gave in his prepared remarks is no htm i mean the company has chosen afs for a reason and yes it presents some more volatility and some more pressure but i think it affords us a lot more flexibility and i think you see that when you look at our tce ratio relative to others that are out there and so for us managing capital is going to be very appropriate but i think were waiting to some degree on regulatory clarity as to how this all times out i think for now obviously dividend is well intact we announced that and thats full speed ahead with buybacks i think we continue to be in nobuyback mode for the moment right now we have had conversation around optimizing certain assets on balance sheet we dont think thats necessarily a push to do but these are things we constantly look at and we will continue to look at and so for now ryan we feel really good about the state of capital level of our capital obviously is our kind of baseline ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 internal target and we think youll gradually get up there but some of this just depends on the time and pace on which we get a message out of ph dc fed on how these things are going to pan out ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for the color jb jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc you got it thanks ryan operator thank you one moment for our next question please and it comes from the line of arren cyganovich with citi please proceed arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the health of the auto market and were seeing commercial loans start to rise a bit but still below prepandemic levels and how the mix of new and used could change over the next couple of years jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah arren thanks for the question and ill start brad again feel free to dive in overall health of the market its pretty solid right now i mean a couple things id point out were still very much supply constrained and while youve seen some gradual uptick in inventories and youve seen commercial balances migrate slightly higher were still in a relatively constrained market and particularly it differs by oembyoem but i think overall we still see things being very constrained and obviously that provides support for the used car market and you see where we continue to be a big player there i think on the dealer health front you probably noticed there were a couple of chargeoffs in the dealer space today i mean these were dealers that we had on watch and i think thats just got to be a trend that we evaluate we think overall dealer health is still really good but thats just kind of a newer development we had a net recovery last year and weve had effectively no chargeoffs there so this is just sort of a new dynamic thats out there but i think generally speaking the big dealers that we tend to do business with that are our largest relationships are still seeing really strong profitability really strong results really strong consumer demand so things are really supportive there the online players obviously carvana was out this morning with some announcements on their restructuring and demonstrating good earnings trends there so netnet we see the industry overall still being very healthy and i think very supportive for where we play bradley j brown a corporate treasurer ally financial inc and maybe just to add a couple of comments and balance sheet from an overall earning asset perspective auto assets of billion or so weve done a little bit of trade as commercial balances have been down a little more retail auto so from a capital connection perspective we really dont have aspiration to see that change and i think we have opportunity between both of those and to jbs point weve seen commercial balances normalize ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 slowly we dont expect them to get back to where they were anytime soon prepandemic and so again we feel good about our ability to support our customers while also being disciplined on capital allocation arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks and on credit card youre growing that at a nice pace its still obviously really small relative to your balance sheet but could you remind us what kind of credit quality customer youre putting into that book as you grow that bradley j brown a corporate treasurer ally financial inc sure so i think its really not that different when you think about sort of overall average fido retail auto being around 700ish today credit card is probably is most likely in that range as well again for us credit card is its a significant opportunity to really expand and deepen relationships as we talked about in certainly white space right which is one of the reasons we entered that market back in december of so as jb highlighted in his remarks the journey continues there theres a lot of opportunity right for us to really expand across allys total 11plus million customers and so i think that opportunity is great at the same time we are very mindful of the unsecured risk and the nature of that book but also our continued allocation of capital particularly in this uncertain backdrop so very careful and disciplined on that approach as well arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thank you bradley j brown a corporate treasurer ally financial inc thanks arren operator thank you one moment for our last question please and it comes from the line of rick shane with jpmorgan please proceed richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks everybody for taking my questions and russ welcome and brad thank you for all the help over the last year just wanted to talk a little bit last quarter there was commentary that the flowtoloss ratios were pretty good im curious in the context of what youre seeing with loss severities potentially picking up in the second half given your outlook for used car prices if you think that there will sort of be a rational expectations in behavior of higher loss frequency as used car prices decline and consumers potentially increasingly strategically default bradley j brown a corporate treasurer ally financial inc yeah hey and good morning rick and appreciate your comments there a couple quick things i know were almost out of time here on the flowtoloss perspective two things i would say stable and still favorable versus prepandemic level so thats certainly a positive weve talked and highlighted about loss severity as well given the used vehicle dynamics we also highlighted given the year weve seen dynamics and values different than we initially expected but were now for the second half of this year assuming a further or it would have to ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 be a decline so all of that sort of factored into our guidance and expectations when we look at the nco rate of full year at richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it yeah look the math for the second half by quarter is very very helpful as we think about thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah thats rick richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks guys jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial
