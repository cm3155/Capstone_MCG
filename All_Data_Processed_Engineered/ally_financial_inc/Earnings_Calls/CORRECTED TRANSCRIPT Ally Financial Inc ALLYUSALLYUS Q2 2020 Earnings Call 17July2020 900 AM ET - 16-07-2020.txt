what ive heard directly from our employees many of our teammates have showed great courage and strength as they shared in broad forums with our teammates their life experiences have not reflected the ideals of equality opportunity and basic human safety that we uphold as citizens were continuing to identify internal and external actions to take as a company in driving real and lasting change this

with volumes of million we entered the home improvement space which will drive incremental volume moving forward through our partnership with authority brands corporate finance balances ended at billion up yearoveryear but down slightly quarteroverquarter as paydown activity occurred following outside first quarter revolver draw activity while the journey through the coming months will undoubtedly be challenging as our country navigates covid this was really exceptional performance across the board for our businesses turning to capital as you are aware we received feedback from the federal reserve on our ccar submission including a preliminary 350basispoint stress capital buffer along with all other participating banks we were notified that we will be required to resubmit our capital plan later this year as one of the largest banks in the us we appreciate the unique circumstances our regulators face in ensuring broadbased financial stability allys balance sheet and capital position remain robust and under the established ccar framework and stress process our capital deployment plans were fully executable now obviously given the uncertainties with covid we decided to suspend share repurchase activity through the end of the year while all banks await further clarity from the fed we remain confident in the strength of our capital position and our proven ability to effectively manage and deploy shareholder capital in a balanced and responsible manner jenn will show you the capital details in a minute but levels look very solid and well do our part in ensuring the fed and others understand the strength of our key financial ratios lets turn to slide number to review core metrics trends across each quadrant demonstrate our resilience and ability to deliver even in a challenging operating environment eps returned to positive territory as revenues ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 remained above billion shown in the

ally remains strong and will continue executing in a manner aligned with our values and strategic objectives in driving longterm value enhancement with that ill turn it over to jenn to take you through the detailed financial results jennifer laclair chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jb and good morning everyone ill begin on slide providing an overview of monthly trends within our auto segment as jb mentioned a moment ago we saw steady improvement throughout the quarter as shelterinplace orders eased and dealers quickly adapted to covid environment many began offering contactless concierge services and increase the use of digital tools in the sales and closing process allys application trends steadily improved with used volume as a percent of originations reaching the highest level on record reflecting the supply dynamics and a shift in consumer preferences that fit our model origination trends shown in the upper right reflected our prudent and disciplined underwriting approach specifically we increased manual underwriting in lieu of automated decisioning and adjusted our buy box across our riskiest credit segments as we closed the quarter we were pleased to generate higher yearoveryear volume in june at appropriate risk adjusted returns used car trends in the bottom left demonstrated strong consumer demand and improved auction activity throughout the quarter yeartodate used car values are down including a decline in april and increase in june we continue to embed a decline of 5plus percentage points for full year given elevated offrental and offlease supplies coupled with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties industrywide vehicle inventory levels dropped yearoveryear the lowest level in years as oem factories went offline in march and april and sales activity depleted dealer stock production has largely resumed and we expect balances will slowly build over the coming months in the interim new vehicle floorplan shortages will challenge dealer sales activities on slide our direct bank product growth continued to accelerate reflecting the value of our digitallybased banking model retail deposit growth was fueled by a combination of market dynamics and allyspecific drivers industry deposit levels expanded due to stimulus and related consumer support reduced consumer spending and the delayed tax filing deadline ally further benefited from robust new customer growth a testament to our competitive rates industryleading service levels and awardwinning digital platform on the bottom left ally home origination trends were up meaningfully compared to prior periods consumer appetite has significantly increased for endtoend digital products our bestinclass nps levels in the upper and our continued accelerating business volumes reflect our ability to deliver low rates drove significant refinance volume along with elevated prepayment activity which ill cover more on later ally financial inc ally corrected

the four highest months of trading activity since we acquired the business in as weve highlighted in the past were intent on providing consumers with convenience digitallybased products and exceptional customer service this consistent approach has driven steady performance and improving trends over the past several years that we expect to continue the strengths and benefits of a digitally driven model are apparent across all our businesses turning to slide we improved metrics demonstrating the strength of our balance sheet during the quarter we approached or exceeded our highest levels across each metric reflecting actions taken recently and over the past several years to solidify our companys balance sheet these results allow us to remain nimble and focused on supporting our customers stable costefficient deposit portfolio has increased to nearly of total funding up from approximately in early weve also continued to diversify our liabilities with wholesale funding while balances have normalized lower weve continued to demonstrate improved execution levels with two costefficient unsecured issuances this quarter in the upper right our liquidity position increased significantly to billion reflecting our ability to withstand adverse changes in the broader environment and remain opportunistic in support of our customers cet1 levels shown on the bottom left exceeded well above regulatory minimum at this level we have billion of excess capital above our scb requirement of allowance for loan losses of or billion represents over there times our reserve balances in early even as the relative size and risk profile of our balance sheet has remained stable together our reserves plus excess cet1 represents billion in total loss absorption capacity while many unknowns remain around the full extent and ongoing developments surrounding covid these metrics reiterate our ability to navigate the challenges ahead lets move to slide to review the income statement net financing revenue excluding oid of billion declined million linked quarter and million yearoveryear while a departure from our ongoing trend of steady improvement the longterm outlook for nii and nim expansions remains intact the decline in the quarter can be attributed to several items unique to the current environment including reduced floorplan balances lower lease gains elevated mortgage premium amortization expense and excess liquidity that weighs on nearterm margins these impacts were partially offset by accretive retail auto and deposit optimization trends which will continue and accelerate as we move forward other revenue of million remained elevated due to strong realized investment gains and robust mortgage fee income provision expense of million was materially lower versus prior quarter but remained elevated compared to prior year as coverage grew noninterest expense increased by million linked quarter and million versus prior year as we outlined in our 10q filing in april we recognized a onetime impairment on the ally invest business adjusted out of the core metrics reflecting industry dynamics including zero commission trends despite this action core business trends ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 are gaining steam and were pleased with the progress the ally invest team has made and the potential for this business long term excluding the impairment quarteroverquarter increases reflect seasonally higher weather losses yearover year weve remained committed to prudently investing in our businesses for the longterm including technology and brand revenuerelated insurance expenses and the inclusion of ally lending in this environment weve renewed our focus on identifying and reducing spend across nonessential areas key metrics at the bottom are adjusted for the goodwill impairment charge and other normalizing items slide includes the detailed results of our balance sheet  net interest margin excluding oid of declined quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear driven by the dynamics i mentioned a moment ago basis points of nim pressure due to excess liquidity basis points from lease impacts and basis points from premium amortization as mortgage rates declined to a 30year low this was partly mitigated by to basis points of nim expansion from auto and deposits dynamics which will drive nim higher in the back half of and beyond average earning assets grew billion and cash and equivalent growth more than offset declines in floorplan balances outside of these line items all other asset categories remained relatively stable or grew quarterover quarter and yearoveryear retail auto portfolio yield excluding hedge impacts expanded basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points yearoveryear lease balances remained flat versus prior quarter and increased yearoveryear while yields declined due to lower offlease gains average commercial auto balances fell billion quarteroverquarter and billion yearoveryear due to the declining oem production and dealer inventory as mentioned earlier turning to liabilities cost of funds improved basis points the fourth consecutive quarteroverquarter decline a trend we expect to continue over the next several quarters turning to slide total deposits grew to billion a yearoveryear increase retail deposit growth of billion exceeded our next highest quarterly growth by or billion we expect our growth trajectory will continue moving forward but will reflect dynamics associated with the delayed tax filing deadline and potential stimulus activity in the bottom left retail deposit rates declined basis points linked quarter and basis points yearoveryear weve remained disciplined and focused in our pricing decisions balancing competitive dynamics and preservation of customer loyalty that weve earned over time we generated our 10th consecutive quarter of an industryleading customer retention rate and as jb covered earlier customer growth of push us over million customers nearly doubling early levels were also pleased to be recognized by kiplinger as the best internet bank for the fourth consecutive year lets turn to capital on slide cet1 ended at in  well above recent trends due to earnings growth lower rwas and the suspension of share repurchases as a reminder we elected to defer capitalrelated impacts ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 associated with cecl until the beginning of per guidance provided by the federal reserve this week our board of directors approved the  common dividend of per share payable on august in the bottom left weve summarized ccar feedback from the federal reserve regarding our cet1 operating requirement of as compared to our internal target of while in a normal operating environment this result would position us to execute our planned capital actions we remain in a holding pattern for further details on the resubmission process our  ending reserves equaled of our internal ninequarter stress losses and of the fed estimates with the variance driven by retail and commercial auto modeling assumptions so to put that in context during the great financial crisis allys retail auto portfolio losses roughly doubled for one to two quarters compared to fed model losses that more than doubled for the entire ninequarter horizon similarly while allys commercial auto losses peaked at basis points of annual ncos a level reflective of the secured highly liquid portfolio the fed average ncos for ci twothirds of which is commercial is across the ninequarter horizon these variances account for between billion and billion of higher fed model stress losses despite these differences our planned capital distributions remained well within the prescribed scb framework we recognize the fluid nature of the environment but feel good about our strong capital levels and our ability to remain nimble in our deployment asset quality details are on slide consolidated net chargeoffs of basis points increased basis points compared to prior year net chargeoffs of million declined million yearoveryear driven by lower retail auto which was largely offset by corporate finance activity moving to retail auto details on the bottom a few broad comments on what were seeing embedded within our results this quarter overall actual credit performance has been stronger than we anticipated at the onset of covid19 while much remains unknown around the ongoing economic environment comprehensive stimulus support programs and proactive customer engagement actions todate have driven encouraging trends robust payment activity occurred across our nondeferred customers materially lowering frequency yearoveryear there was a modest increase in severity as used vehicle values declined and repossession volume decreased due to stateimposed moratoriums in place through june and related to the deferred population accounting guidance led to million increase in ncos we expect actual losses to be below this level as we work through our standard process to keep our customers in their cars collectively this resulted in retail auto ncos of basis points a decline of basis points yearoveryear delinquencies performed favorably versus our expectations overall even considering deferral program impact based on these trends we still believe our full year ncos will remain within our previously stated to range slide provides additional detail on reserve levels and coverage reserves of billion and coverage of increased at the consolidated level reflecting higher retail auto coverage levels and the impact of declining floor plan which carries a lower coverage given the strong credit profile of the portfolio the reserve walk on the bottom reflects the  impact of the deteriorating macroeconomic forecast including unemployment peaking above before declining to by yearend and then migrating to our cecl models historic mean weve continued to exclude any stimulusrelated benefit or assumptions within our modeling loss absorption capacity of this magnitude prepares us to navigate the elevated nco activity we are expecting in the coming quarters ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 on slide weve included an update on our auto deferral program cumulatively million auto customers enrolled with in current payment status customer payment trends increased every month during the quarter with of our customers paying in june prior to their scheduled due date supporting our view that many used the program for added payment flexibility on the righthand side of the page weve included a monthly view of deferment expiration timing of the total population have scheduled expirations during the quarter including the majority of customers who entered the program in 30plus delinquency status payment trends for this population have been in line with our expectations balance of the deferral expirations will occur over the next few months keep in mind the vast majority of these customers enter the deferment in a nondelinquent payment status weve remained proactive in preparing for this phase of the program managing staffing levels launching new digital payment tools and maintaining steady engagement with participants and we are pleased overall with outcomes todate on slide ill highlight a few additional metrics in the auto segment net financing revenue trends reflect lower commercial balances libor levels and lower lease gains noninterest expense declined seasonally quarter overquarter and was substantially flat yearoveryear the resilient and adaptable nature of our auto business was fully reflected this quarter where estimated retail new origination yields remained above for the ninth consecutive quarter we seamlessly transitioned a consumer preference for used and we were opportunistic as weve done in the past among established and emerging industry players lets turn to slide  auto originations of billion declined quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear reflecting industry dynamics average fico and nonprime volumes remained steady used comprised of origination the highest level weve seen of the company and in the bottom left ending consumer assets were up slightly quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear to billion while commercial assets on the bottom right declined as described a few moments ago insurance results are on slide core pretax income of million in  was down million this linked quarter due to seasonally higher weather losses and up million yearoveryear as realized gains offset weather losses that normalized higher selling historically low levels in written premiums of million declined yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter reflecting lower floorplan levels and declining vehicle sales underlying trends steadily improved throughout the quarter as june written premium levels were higher versus prior year turning to slide corporate finance core pretax income was million in the quarter up million quarter overquarter and down million yearoveryear ending assets declined million during the quarter reflecting repayment of approximately of elevated  credit line draws related to the pandemic and additional pay downs from some borrowers who received government stimulus we charged off two credits during the quarter that were impacted by covid19 these exposures were largely reserved for and had a provision impact of million in  our origination strategy remains focused on a steady approach to growing balances and returns while managing risk largely through assetbased yields we continue to monitor criticized and nonaccrual loan trends along with ongoing developments among our client base on slide mortgage pretax income of million in  declined versus prior quarter and yearoveryear due to the impact of elevated prepayment activity within the bulk portfolio directtoconsumer origination volume was robust as we continued leveraging existing relationships with of originations sourced from an existing ally ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 customer the low rate environment drove strong refinance activity for us representing of originations in the quarter were encouraged by these trends and expect volume to remain strong as we move forward ill close by

navigate and win in challenging environments and with that daniel i think we can go into qa daniel eller executive directorinvestor relations ally financial inc all right thank you jb so ill remind participants to please as we head into the qa session please limit yourself to one question and one followup operator you may now teeup the qa ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from sanjay sakhrani of kbw your line is open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning thank you i guess first question on the reserve build i was wondering jenn if you could just walk through some of the assumptions youve made around the outlook jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and good morning sanjay yes and i mentioned in the script here the macroeconomic assumptions we essentially had unemployment which is our biggest macroeconomic driver hit about here in  then glide down to about yearend and then revert to our mean under cecl at about towards the end of and that did drive a bit more of a reserve and drive our coverage up a bit this quarter we also have not embedded any assumptions around kind of stimulus or the deferred population just some of the relief that weve provided to our forbearance programs so we havent embedded any of that either yeah and at this point we feel really good about the reserve coverage levels so on retail auto were coverage rate our nco levels weve reiterated the to range that we feel like were in a great spot in terms of the reserve coverage at this point sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then my followup question jb is for you on the cardworks deal given its behind you now i was just curious if that all experience has changed any views in terms of the diversification efforts you were considering thanks jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah thanks for the question sanjay i mean obviously we have been saying for quite some time we still like the unsecured space and i think that remains true but obviously you have to reflect on the environment that youre in and the fact that theres going to be challenges out there for the next while so for us i think the focus in the short term what i call over the next to months is really keeping our head down caring for the franchises inhouse i mean i think as jenn showed and demonstrated in her comments i mean all the newer businesses are really starting to accelerate and we feel very good about that i mean ally lendings got a number of bright spots ally home bright spots ally invest the same and then auto and deposits are just phenomenally wellpositioned right now and i think our focus and what weve done on the used space is just working really really well i mean emerging players like echopark carvana just great partners there and then the traditional dealer base we just got great relationships with dealers across the country ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 and so were comfortable in the positions for now and i think just in this environment you got to care for what you have more than anything and long term well go through and continue to assess like i think all of our shareholders would expect us to do what makes sense for ally for the long run but again as ive said i got a ton of respect for don berman hes a great operator and i think don in some ways looks forward to the most challenging environments because i believe thats when he thinks his company is going to really shine and so a ton of respect and credit for him and well keep our head down and keep ally advancing forward sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks sanjay operator our next question comes from betsy graseck morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to dig in a little bit on the outlook for net chargeoffs that you indicated for the full year jenn especially given that youve got some deferments coming out over the next few months and when i look at the slide you highlight that the early payment trends for customers exiting deferment is aligned with expectations maybe you could help us understand what those expectations are and how we should anticipate deferment rolloffs impacting delinquencies and then net chargeoffs because youre implying a pretty big uptick in the second half nco so just want to get some color around that jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure thanks for the question betsy all are good questions and the theme here is going to be a lot still tobe determined at this point but let me just hit on deferment population and then the nondeferment population but within deferment weve seen about of our account scheduled to expire at this point and we have some expectations in terms of payment activity rolled to nco and rolled to delinquency bucket and as i mentioned id say performance todate is largely in line but you also have to keep in mind theres stimulus in the system we dont know whats going to recur just from an overall pandemic rollout or additional stimulus and so were going to continue to watch that population very very closely but as i mentioned kind of everything is in line with expectation ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 next quarter we have any additional of that deferment population scheduled to expire so this is our much higher credit quality population so we believe that theyre going to perform well but thats a large percent of accounts and we just have to see how that performs over the next couple of months and because those two populations are largely todate performing in line with expectations were still expecting kind of that to retail auto nco rate that we put out in the first quarter so everything right now is still consistent in line with expectations but i will say that there is a lot more to come we are very much in the early innings of seeing how the deferral population works and well continue to monitor it extremely closely and then in the nondeferral population and you kind of you see this in the overall nco rate the retail auto coming down basis points 30plus dq is coming down about basis points we continue to see just really robust performance in that population but again a lot on home relative to the overall impact of the pandemic the macroeconomic environment stimulus et cetera but so far so good betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then just the followup question has to do with the outlook for usedcar prices i think you indicated in prepared remarks keeping the down for the full year i think we just heard this morning manheim saying that usedcar prices are up yearonyear in the first couple of weeks of july and wanted to understand if that makes sense to you given your mix i know your mix is a little bit more skewed to suv and truck jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean couple of dynamics that play there i mean we came into this year guiding towards kind of a to decline in usedvehicle prices entirely just driven by supply dynamics with a lot of offvehicles coming into the market as we came through  with this pandemic we saw a precipitous drop in usedvehicle prices so its about drop in april which very quickly recovered to a plus as we ended  here and were still seeing strong signs as we come here into july but with all the volatility around new vehicle prices knowing how quickly and materially they can move around on us were still guiding towards kind of a 5plus percent decline in usedvehicle prices and then well see where it goes from here i think the positive dynamic is new vehicle inventory is still pretty low in this environment with stress on the consumer the value of the used vehicle outweighs that of a new from a pricing perspective so those are all positive dynamics on the negative here health of the consumer could further deteriorate and overall demand could decline and we still do have the supply side challenges so were just being measured knowing that this is a line item that can move around very quickly on us betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah thank you betsy ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 operator our next question comes from moshe orenbuch of credit suisse your line is open moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks jenn i appreciate the comments that you made about the payments could you talk just a little bit about how you think about the way the consumer has behaved thus far the ones in deferment the ones out of deferment and the potential for intervention and how do you think that if you had taken that into account how would that impact your expected loss reserving those elements jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure sure moshe so consumer behavior let me start there what i would say is a lot of our consumers as we were expecting use this program as kind of an insurance policy against whats to come with covid and we went out with a program that was open to everyone we made it very easy to enroll and weve seen over the last couple of months an increase in payment rates even while the payments werent due so that started in kind of in retail auto about approaching we ended june almost a quarter of our customers were making payments in spite of the fact that their deferrals werent expiring and so were very encouraged by that id say underneath the covers just on the more stressed population that was scheduled to expire this quarter weve been pleased the vast majority of them are paying and are in current status but some are in delinquency and were just expecting those to at some point roll or potentially go to nco which is why weve been very consistent in terms of our nco expectations on this population relative to the stimulus i mean we absolutely think that thats a net positive here i mean if you look at savings rates across the consumer they continue to grow were seeing strong payment rates not only in retail auto but also in mortgage as well as ally lending and certainly we think stimulus is a net plus from a loss perspective and from a payment perspective but also were clearly seeing that in the deposit trend across ally as well as the rest of the industry but i feel good right now just in terms of trends are in line with expectations weve kept consistency around the nco projections this year and certainly were very wellcovered relative to those expectations moshe moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and for a followup you show in the slides that deposit costs were for the second quarter and you mentioned that thats going to be a driver going into  could you talk about what that would be kind of marked to todays rate and what your plans are for deposit rates given the strong growth in liquidity that youve got jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure and yeah im sure youve seen on osa which is going to be a very big driver of nii and the nim expansion i talked about in the back half of and going into osa rates are down to thats really going to help us and we moved down kind of july so early this month and thats really going to help propel our nii and our nim and if you think about that osa rate kind of the beta on that relative to the beta on the retail auto new origination pricing is times and thats really whats going to funnel that continued growth in net interest income ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 we continue to be very strong in terms of retail originated yields over for nine consecutive quarters now that could move around a little bit as we go into the second half but theres clearly opportunities for our overall retail auto book to migrate up towards that weve been originating for so much so many quarters in a row moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc okay thank you jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you moshe operator our next question comes from rob wildhack of autonomous research your line is open robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp good morning guys just to follow up on the originated yields over i think that might have been better than you had expected what were the drivers there jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah so a couple of dynamics one is we continue to see just record levels of used which tend to carry a higher yield so just the favorability on mix overall and then we continue to have strong flows coming from some of the emerging players in the market and jb mentioned a couple of the names there and just we continue to be very pleased with just some of the flows that were seeing there that drove the yield up now were heading into the third quarter here second half of we are seeing new originated yields coming in kind of high range and well always aim to outperform that but its going to depend a bit on where the market lands robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp got it and then can you just remind us what happens when a borrower comes off forbearance how do they get back to current is it just a larger monthly payment or is there a lump sum due any color you can add there would be great jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure so as the accounts are scheduled to expire we expect our customers to just make one payment and that brings them to current immediately and so its just very simple process where you just need to start paying your loan again theres no lump sum payment or anything like that rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp okay thank you ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure thanks operator our next question comes from rick shane of jpmorgan your line is open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my questions this morning first question is given over the last several years weve seen such strong used car prices and that means that as leases expire the market value of the cars is actually above the purchase option price as were seeing a decline in used car values are you guys expecting a higher percentage of or a lower percentage of leases that are expiring to exercise the purchase option jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah rick i appreciate the question were not seeing any big change there not really id say overall with respect to offlease vehicles demand for used has continued to remain strong and i think thats really what matters here not seeing any big shift indiscernible jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc the offlease percent that are sitting in the vehicle richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thank you jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and then its interesting that and you just said it again and you talk about the strong demand for used cars i am curious what you guys think about the supply of used cars particularly given that there has been essentially a partial moratorium on repossessions do you think that that dynamic will change as we move through the second half of the year jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah what id say on the moratorium on repossessions has actually helped to continue to bolster used vehicle prices and we have some programs around offlease customer activity that allowed us to preserve pricing in the used space as well so id say thats overall been a net plus ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 i think what youre going to see over the next couple of months barring any systemic reversals on reopenings or any potential stress here in the back half of the year i think youre going to see those moratoriums really run off and ours has certainly started to run off so were getting much more kind of closer to business as usual on repossession and ill just go back to what ive said before which is was to be one of the peak years in terms of offlease vehicles so wed expect to your question on supply we still expect to see some very robust used vehicle supply in the market which has really helped to offset what weve seen on the new vehicle production stress that weve had its really helped to kind of bolster inventory across the system richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great jenn thank you very much jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc sure jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks rick jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc thanks operator our next question comes from eric wasserstrom of ubs your line is open eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks very much jb and jenn two questions one a small one and then maybe a larger one to follow up the little one just relates to the ci nco experience this quarter which was a bit higher than the trend can you just touch on what occurred there jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah sure so we had two credits that we charged off this quarter they were credits that have started to deteriorate back half of so we had already largely reserved for those credits and what we saw was covid kind of accelerated their movement in the nco now i would say just more broadly on that book the percent of nonaccrual continues to remain pretty solid and stable at around and in spite of that we have continued to grow coverage so overall credit quality is still performing well overall book looks good and those were credits again that emerged precovid ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then i guess my larger question is this i mean there were so many things that were unusual in this quarter and those things were manifested as you might expect in your balance sheet and income statement so is there any way that you can just help us frame sort of what to think about in terms of quarterly cadence of performance for maybe the next few just directionally in terms of some of the other key line item you talked obviously a bit to the nim and to the card and fill rates but theres just so many other things liquidity position et cetera can you just help kind of frame what the range of outcomes might look like jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah and maybe let me start first on the balance sheet and then couple of comments on the income statement but i mean on the balance sheet appreciate you recognizing unusual events here because we would concur wholeheartedly with that summary but yeah what we saw across the new vehicle space is just the oem production has slowed precipitously inventories are down about and so kind of the most unusual thing that weve seen on the balance sheet relative to expectations coming into this year its just the floorplan levels have declined about billion linked quarter coupled with the fact that weve had just incredible deposit inflows you see just the growth in cash on the balance sheet now over the course of the last half of we would expect inventory levels new vehicle production to increase wed expect slowly to see the commercial balances grow and well be very prudent in deploying that cash that we have sitting on the balance sheet but wed expect cash over time to come down audio gap i mentioned most of the other line items on the balance sheet performing well we could see retail auto balances come down a hair just because originations are going to be a little lighter this year but overall seeing strong mortgage production ally lending audio gap as we shift to the income statement id say just in summary ppnr looks to be pretty stable first half to second half talked about kind of nii being in a trough wed expect that to expand back half of this year other revenue came in kind of at record levels this quarter we can see that normalize a bit lower just based on it will be dependent on our opportunities to take investments gains and then the real wildcard here is its going to be what happens with the macros and what happens with credit we think weve got a great handle on it so far but theres still a lot of uncertainty in the environment that could potentially move provision for credit losses around a bit i think the company with our balance sheet where it is we feel like were in a great position in this environment weve got strong liquidity weve got our highest level of capital that weve had in the history of the company so irrespective of the unusual that continues we think were incredibly well positioned and were focused on the right things were focused on supporting our customers in this environment we can do that because of the strength of the balance sheet were focused on essentialism making sure that were investing in the right opportunities to position us for the future and we feel really good about our ability to navigate eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks so much ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah operator our next question comes from arren cyganovich of citi your line is open arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks the deposit growth was very strong and you mentioned that the taxes payments kind of shifting from to are there any other kind of temporary aspects that drove that higher ppp loans that kind of stuff that youd think of there may be a bit of a pullback in the deposits in the third quarter jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah so a couple things ill say the overall industry is growing about and i think a lot of that has to do with whether thats ppp stimulus checks that kind of are in consumers hands right now and just the overall kind of defensive posture that you see around consumers in this kind of environment so id say just across the industry seems robust deposit growth then as you shift to the digital banks we continue to win from a share perspective digital growth digital direct back growth was about double that over this quarter so that we continue to have trends in our favor in that regard and then i think ally has positioned itself which is with our digital capabilities our brand our great ph rate pay that weve continued to win even within that digital i think you mentioned tax payments we did have that roll through kind of july were still seeing really robust deposits growth here in july in spite of taxes and were expecting that to continue over the back half of this year but i mean theres no doubt that direct banks are going to continue to win in this environment arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay and then secondly that the trends in retail auto obviously showed tremendous improvement in june and i know its still kind of early but were seeing covid resurgence across a lot of the country are you seeing anything in july thats kind of slowing that positive trend that youre having there jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i mean to be completely measured on this june may have had a bit of pentup demand we saw originations down in april and pop back up to over here in june id say july is still moving forward very strong originations i think the dealers and this asset class has proven to be incredibly resilient in this audio gap and obviously put all the caveats around that as we dont know exactly whats going to unfold from covid and the macros but i think we feel great about just the resiliency even if we do take a bit of a double dip here that this industry can recover very quickly ally financial inc ally corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc all right thank you operator our next question comes from john hecht with jefferies your line is open john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thanks guys for taking my question and good morning most of my questions have been asked and answered i guess over the intermediate term im curious as to your digital channels like carvana are growing theres been a shift to consumers even getting preapproved for loans be it digital channels how do you guys think that affects the market and how are you guys positioned to deal with that in the intermediate term jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah i appreciate the question and short answer here is we feel were really wellpositioned and have continued to benefit from being kind of agnostic to whether a dealer a digital whether theyre more traditional and i think in this environment weve seen an acceleration of the traditional dealers becoming more digital and finding a lot of opportunities to whether offer contactless sales or concierge services i mean we are seeing the entire industry shift very quickly to digital that being said with the purely digital offerings out there weve continued to grow our relationships there and we feel great about just being able to support all of our dealers wherever they are on the journey to digital and like i said this environment has really accelerated that movement overall and we think thats a net plus from a consumer perspective jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc and john the only thing maybe id add is just as jenn pointed out i think when we talk to the little the smaller onestore dealers and the big chains like rick hendricks hendrick automotive group their biggest challenge right now they just need more cars i mean theyll tell you thats the bigger challenge and obviously with the factories being impacted theres just not a new car flow coming into them so thats part of the reason why jenn covered used cars felt really good right now we still have a sort of a more balanced outlook going forward because we do think new car production should return but i mean its really interesting when you talk to the dealer base they really say thats the bigger challenge they face more than anything is just simple lack of the inventory john hecht q analyst jefferies llc great thanks very much appreciate the content jennifer laclair a chief financial officer ally financial inc you got it thanks john ally
