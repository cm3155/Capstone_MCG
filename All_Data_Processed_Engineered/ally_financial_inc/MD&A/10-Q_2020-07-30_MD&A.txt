the acquisition of health credit services significant business developments related to covid19 the spread of covid19 has created a global publichealth crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility and deteriorations in household business economic and market conditions including in the united states where we conduct nearly all of our business covid19 has not yet been contained and could continue to affect significantly more households and businesses the duration and severity of the pandemic remain impossible to predict as the initial slowing of the number of cases nationally has recently reversed and the potential exists for further resurgences to occur many governmental and nongovernmental authorities have directed their actions toward curtailing household and business activity to contain covid19 while simultaneously deploying fiscal and monetarypolicy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses these actions have not always been coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions and have varied in scope and intensity over time while this response initially slowed the rate of spread of covid19 and supported economic stability it is not clear whether the salutary effects will persist especially if resurgences worsen or increase national regional and local economies and markets could suffer further disruptions that are lasting the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted us and our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers since its spread began to accelerate in march while we experienced some improvements in our business late in the second quarter we cannot yet be confident in the sustainability of this reboundespecially with the recent resurgence of covid19 in many parts of the united statesand the adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations and prospects could be significant as time goes on for further information on these risks and uncertainties refer to the section titled risk factors in part ii item of this report during the first quarter of the most notable impacts to our results of operations were a higher provision expense for credit losses and a decline in the fair value of our portfolio of equity securities our provision expense was million for the first quarter of compared to million for the first quarter of with the increase primarily driven by million of incremental reserves associated with a deterioration in macroeconomic variables such as unemployment during the second quarter of we incurred total provision expense of million which included million attributable to the macroeconomic environment and other factors aside from changes in portfolio size and incremental chargeoffs given the unpredictability of covid19 and its direct and indirect effects however our forecast of macroeconomic conditions and operating resultsincluding expected lifetime credit losses on our loan portfoliois subject to meaningful uncertainty as for our portfolio of equity securities while we experienced realized and unrealized losses of million during the first quarter of primarily due to the unfavorable market conditions associated with covid19 a recovery in the equity markets resulted in realized and unrealized gains of million during the second quarter of it is possible that unusual volatility in the equity markets could continue and impact our results as governments acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of businesses including automotive dealers and as many consumers and businesses changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to sharply restrain commercial and social interactions we experienced significant reductions in our consumer automotive loan application volume during the second half of march and into april in addition we observed downward pressure on the automotive sales and other operating results of our dealer customers on their capacity to accept the return of leased vehicles and on usedvehicle auction activity and values as consumers and businesses began to adapt to the changed conditions and many governmental authorities relaxed their restrictions later in the second quarter however we observed a gradual recovery in activity including stronger usedvehicle prices even so many automotive manufacturers and their suppliers had taken measures to slow or shut down production in response to the pandemic which negatively affected dealer inventory levels and sales during the second quarter of and significantly reduced wholesale floorplan lending business to dealers refer to the section titled automotive financing volume in this mda for a further discussion regarding the impacts of covid19 on our business lower dealer inventory levels also reduced vehicle inventory insurance premiums within our insurance operations declining sales and limited operations at dealers during the second half of march and into april reduced demand in our insurance operations for consumer products such as vsc and gap protection but as in our automotive finance operations we experienced a gradual recovery in these consumer products later in the managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q second quarter within our corporate finance business we experienced higher draws on commercial customer lines of credit during the second half of march but this trend abated in april refinance volume and prepayment activity increased for our mortgage finance business during the second quarter of driven by lower market interest rates from the current economic environment our deposits franchise recorded strong growth in both retail and total deposits during the first and second quarters of despite substantial outflows to brokerage accounts during march our retail deposit customer retention rate remained high at during both the first and second quarter of governments have taken unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their containment measures for example in late march the cares act was enacted to inject more than trillion of financial assistance into the us economy one component of the cares act is the ppp which is a guaranteed unsecured loan program administered by the sba loans under the ppp are fully guaranteed and may be forgiven by the sba and can be obtained by small businesses and other entities to cover payroll costs and other expenses including mortgage payments rents and utilities we had million of loans outstanding to our dealer customers under the ppp as of june among its other provisions the cares act significantly expands eligibility for and the amount of unemployment benefits creates and funds the advance payment of a refundable tax credit for and appropriates billion to the treasury secretary to support us air carriers and other us businesses that have not otherwise received adequate economic relief as well as states and municipalities the frb has taken decisive and sweeping actions as well since march these actions have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses such as the municipal liquidity facility the main street lending program the primary market corporate credit facility the secondary market corporate credit facility the term assetbacked securities loan facility the money market mutual fund liquidity facility and the commercial paper funding facility we have acted swiftly to support our customers with industryleading programs and at the same time manage our credit risk in our automotive finance business existing consumer loan and lease customers had the option to elect to defer their loan payments for up to days without late fees being incurred but for consumer automotive loans with finance charges continuing to accrue this program was made available to consumer automotive loan and lease customers from march through june for dealers with current accounts we have offered for up to four months a waiver of curtailments on wholesale floorplan loans an increase in floorplan advance rates a deferral of interest and insurance charges on wholesale borrowings and a deferral of term loan payments in our mortgagelending business existing customers experiencing financial hardship due to an interruption of income related to the covid19 pandemic have been afforded the opportunity to defer their loan payments for up to days without late fees being incurred but with interest continuing to accrue in our personallending business existing customers experiencing financial hardship due to the covid19 pandemic were able to elect to defer their loan payments for up to days without late fees being incurred or finance charges continuing to accrue for more detail and further discussion refer to the section titled credit quality indicators in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements and to the section titled risk management within this mda for our deposit customers we are waiving fees for overdrafts excessive transactions and expedited shipping of checks and debit cards through july for our brokerage customers we are waiving fees for brokerassisted trades paper statements and overnight outbound check processing through july the degree to which our actions and those of governments and others will directly or indirectly assist our customers counterparties and thirdparty service providers and advance our business and the economy generally is not yet clear for example while our loandeferral programs may better position customers to resume their regular payments to us in the future and enhance our brand and customer loyalty these programs may negatively impact our revenue and other results of operations at least in the near term and may not be as successful as we expect in managing our credit risk in addition while the frbs accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by supporting economic activity among our customers this policy and sudden shifts in it may inhibit our ability to grow or sustain net interest income and effectively manage interestrate and market risks additionally while extraordinary governmental intervention in the economy and markets has created stability the scale of these actions inevitably heightens political reputational litigation and similar risks for financial intermediaries like us furthermore while governmental stimulus and relief programs may have supported the financial condition of some of our customers in the early stages of the pandemic these programs may be discontinued or curbed before the economy recovers may otherwise be insufficient and may create political fiscal monetary and other adverse consequences for households and businesses in light of volatility in the capital markets and economic disruptions we continue to carefully monitor our capital and liquidity positions on march in order to support the frbs effort to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the us economy and the financial system we announced the voluntary suspension of our stockrepurchase program through its termination on june we do not currently plan to implement a new stockrepurchase program or repurchase shares of our common stock except in connection with compensation plans for the remainder of in march the us banking agencies issued an interim final rule that became effective on march and that provides banking organizations with an alternative option to delay for two years their estimates of the impact of cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period as further described in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements we elected this alternative option instead of the one described in the december rule previously issued by banking agencies as of june the total deferred impact on common equity tier capital related to our adoption of cecl was billion at june ally and ally bank were wellcapitalized and met all applicable regulatory capital requirements including with common equity tier capital ratios of and respectively compared to the minimum requirement of we continue to anticipate that we will have sufficient capital levels to meet all of these requirements additionally we continue to access our routine shortterm funding sources such as fhlb

governmental mandates and advisories have necessitated changes in the way we operate our business we activated our business continuity plan in late february and since then have migrated nearly all of our workforce offsite or to workfromhome arrangements to mitigate health risks we are also carefully monitoring the activities of our vendors and other thirdparty service providers to manage the risks associated with any potential service disruptions the length of time we may be required to operate under these circumstances as well as the potential for them to worsen or for significant disruptions

in addition we establish and maintain underwriting policies and limits across our portfolios and higher risk segments for example nonprime based on our risk appetite another important aspect to managing credit risk involves the need to carefully monitor and manage the performance and pricing of our loan products with the aim of generating appropriate riskadjusted returns when considering pricing various granular riskbased factors are considered such as expected loss rates loss volatility anticipated operating costs and targeted returns on equity we carefully monitor credit losses and trends in credit losses relative to expected credit losses at contract inception we closely monitor our loan performance and profitability in light of forecasted economic conditions and manage credit risk and expectations of losses in the portfolio we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower the source of repayment the underlying collateral and current market conditions we monitor the credit risk profile of individual borrowers various segmentations for example geographic region product type industry segment as well as the aggregate portfolio we perform quarterly analyses of the consumer automotive consumer mortgage consumer other and commercial portfolios using a range of indicators to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on historical and current trends refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information additionally we utilize numerous collection strategies to mitigate loss and provide ongoing support to customers in financial distress for consumer automotive loans we work with customers when they become delinquent on their monthly payment in lieu of repossessing their vehicle we may offer several types of assistance to aid our customers based on their willingness and ability to repay their loan loss mitigation may include payment extensions and rewrites of the loan terms for mortgage loans as part of certain programs we offer mortgage loan modifications to qualified borrowers these programs are in place to provide support to our mortgage customers in financial distress including principal forgiveness maturity extensions delinquent interest capitalization and changes to contractual interest rates furthermore we manage our credit exposure to financial counterparties based on the risk profile of the counterparty within our policies we have established standards and requirements for managing counterparty risk exposures in a safe and sound manner counterparty credit risk is derived from multiple exposure types including derivatives securities trading securities financing transactions financial futures cash balances for example due from depository institutions restricted accounts and cash equivalents and investment in debt securities for more information on derivative counterparty credit risk refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements

is impacted by certain forecasted economic factors as further described in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for example macroeconomic variables that our consumer automotive allowance for loan losses is most sensitive to include national and state unemployment levels our process for determining the allowance for loan losses considers a borrowers willingness and ability to pay and considers other factors including loan modification programs in addition to our quantitative allowance for credit losses we also incorporate qualitative adjustments that may relate to idiosyncratic risks changes in current economic conditions that may not be reflected in quantitatively derived results such as the impacts associated with covid19 covid19 impacts during the second

growth assetliability positioning and interest rates based on the implied forward curve the analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and noncontractual maturities we continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing actions simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast the changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets liabilities and offbalancesheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates the net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following months we test a number of alternative rate scenarios including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types relative to our baseline forecast which is based on the implied forward curve our net financing revenue over the next months

compared to december as interest rates were at or near historical lows across the curve the impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections as of june our net interest income sensitivity in the and basis point instantaneous shock scenarios is positioned to benefit primarily due to changes to our derivative hedging position and the impact of lower market interest rates the exposure in the downward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario has increased as of june primarily due to the derivative hedging position referenced above as well as the impact of lower rates due to the low absolute level of market interest rates this downward shock is muted as our models assume rates do not go below zero our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixedrate assets and fixedrate debt instruments and payfixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floatingrate debt instruments we also have the ability to utilize interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floatingrate assets the size

remained lower and demand improved the number of offlease vehicles remarketed during the three months and six months ended june decreased and compared to the same periods in primarily due to impacts of the covid19 pandemic which reduced vehicle remarketing activity at auction sites and lowered dealer demand additionally in jurisdictions where governments acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of automotive dealers there were fewer vehicles returned at lease termination delays in vehicle remarketing may adversely impact our remarketing proceeds upon sale in future periods in

marketbased funding across various maturity interest rate and investor profiles additional liquidity is available through a pool of unencumbered highly liquid securities committed secured credit facilities repurchase agreements and advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh we define liquidity risk as the risk that an institutions financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions liquidity risk can arise from a variety of institutionspecific or marketrelated events that could have a negative impact on cash flows available to the organization effective management of liquidity risk positions an organization to meet cash flow obligations caused by unanticipated events managing liquidity needs and contingent funding exposures has proven essential to the solvency of financial institutions the alco chaired by the corporate treasurer is responsible for overseeing our funding and liquidity strategies corporate treasury is responsible for managing our liquidity positions within limits approved by alco and the rc as part of managing liquidity risk corporate treasury prepares periodic forecasts depicting anticipated funding needs and sources of funds executes our funding strategies and manages liquidity under normal as well as more severely stressed macroeconomic environments oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk are provided by independent risk management funding strategy liquidity and ongoing profitability are largely dependent on the timely and costeffective access to retail deposits and funding in various segments of the capital markets we focus on maintaining diversified funding sources across a broad base of depositors lenders and investors to meet liquidity needs throughout different economic cycles including periods of financial distress these funding sources include retail and brokered deposits committed secured credit facilities public and private assetbacked securitizations unsecured debt fhlb advances wholeloan sales demand notes and repurchase agreements our access to diversified funding sources enhances funding flexibility and results in a more costeffective funding strategy over the long term we evaluate funding markets on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate balance of unsecured and secured funding sources and maturity profiles we manage our funding to achieve a wellbalanced portfolio across a spectrum of risk maturity and costoffunds characteristics optimizing funding at ally bank continues to be a key part of our longterm liquidity strategy we optimize our funding sources at ally bank by growing retail deposits maintaining active public and private securitization programs managing a prudent maturity profile of our brokered deposit portfolio utilizing repurchase agreements and continuing to access funds from the fhlb essentially all asset originations are directed to ally bank to reduce parent company exposures and funding requirements and to utilize our growing consumer deposittaking capabilities this allows us to use bank funding for an increasing proportion of our automotive finance and other assets and to provide a sustainable longterm funding channel for the business while also improving the cost of funds for the enterprise liquidity risk management multiple metrics are used to measure liquidity risk manage the liquidity position identify related trends and monitor such trends and metrics against established limits these metrics include coverage ratios and comprehensive stress tests that measure the sufficiency of the liquidity portfolio over stressed horizons ranging from overnight to months stability ratios that measure longerterm structural liquidity and concentration ratios that enable prudent funding

guaranteed by the small business administration we continue to closely monitor market conditions and actions taken by banking agencies to support general market liquidity in recent years we have become less reliant on marketbased funding and believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our nearterm funding needs however it is not currently clear to what degree the covid19 pandemic will impact our future funding profile if market dislocation recurs during we accessed the public and private markets to execute secured funding transactions and to manage our committed secured credit facility

these retail deposits provide our automotive finance mortgage finance and corporate finance operations as well as ally lending with a stable and lowcost funding source retail deposits are a key driver of funding cost optimization and reduced reliance on capital marketsbased funding we believe retail deposits are less sensitive to interest rate changes market volatility or changes in credit ratings when compared to other funding sources we have continued to expand our deposit gathering efforts through both direct and indirect marketing channels current retail deposit offerings consist of a

management funding and regulatory capital in our annual report on form 10k during the first six months of we raised million through the completion of a term securitization transaction backed by consumer automotive loans we manage securitization execution risk by maintaining a diverse domestic and foreign investor base and available capacity from committed secured credit facilities provided by banks our ability to access the unused capacity in these facilities depends on the availability of eligible assets to collateralize the incremental funding and in some instances on the execution of interest rate hedges we maintain bilateral facilities which fund our automotive finance operations the facilities can be revolving in naturegenerally having an original tenor ranging from days to two years and allowing for additional funding during the commitment periodor they can be amortizing and not allow for any further funding after the commitment period at june all of our billion of capacity was revolving and of this balance million was from facilities with a remaining tenor greater than days our securitizations of commercial automotive loans are issued through a single master trust and include creditenhancement triggers as well as earlyrepayment triggers referred to as early amortization events following an early amortization event principal collections on the loans in the applicable securitizations are applied to repay principal of the trusts assetbacked securities rather than to purchase newly originated loans one of the early amortization events is based on the rates of inventory turnover at our dealer customers referred to as payment rates because the covid19 pandemic is placing downward pressure on the automotive sales of dealers and therefore their rate of inventory turnover an increased risk exists that an early amortization event could occur in such a case our ability to issue new securitizations managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10q out of this trust would be constrained or eliminated and our ability to fund commercial automotive loans through the securitization market could be delayed while we establish a new trust in addition the mere occurrence of an early amortization event could impair our ability to access the securitization market or increase our cost to do so at this time none of these securitizations have experienced an early amortization event the majority of our securitizations including our secured bilateral financing facilities involve consumer automotive loans we retain exposure to the nonperformance of these loans through subordinated retained interests in the securitizations as well as obligations to repurchase loans affected by breaches of representations warranties or covenants the secured bilateral financing facilities also include creditenhancement triggers and revolving period termination events based on the nonperformance of loans with the covid19 pandemic adversely affecting some of our consumer automotive customers and with a significant number of them having enrolled in our loandeferral program these securitizations may become more likely to experience a deterioration in loan performance and downgrades by rating agencies in addition the secured bilateral financing facilities may become more likely to experience the activation of creditenhancement triggers and revolving period termination events any of these outcomes could have negative impacts on noteholders and us including in our case a potential for higher pricing and less market access for future securitizations we also have access to funding through advances with the fhlb these advances are primarily secured by consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans and investment securities

valuation of automotive lease assets and residuals fair value of financial instruments determination of provision for income taxes on january we adopted asu financial instruments credit losses this guidance replaced the incurred loss methodology which was used to calculate the allowance for loan losses as described in the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form 10k with an expected lifetime loss methodology as described in the allowance for loan losses section below during we did not substantively change any material aspect of our overall methodologies and processes used in developing the remaining critical accounting estimates from what was described in the consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form 10k refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the methodology used in calculating the provision for income taxes for interim financial reporting allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses the allowance to reflect the net amount expected to be collected from our lending portfolios the allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations using relevant available information which includes both internal and external sources relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions additions and reductions to the allowance are charged to current period earnings through the provision for credit losses amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance net of amounts recovered on previously chargedoff accounts expected recoveries do not exceed the total of amounts chargedoff or expected to be chargedoff the allowance is measured using statistical models that are designed to correlate certain macroeconomic variables to expected future credit losses the macroeconomic data used in the models are based on forecasted variables for the next months beyond this forecast period we revert to an historical average for each of the variables on a straightline basis over months the allowance reflects managements estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment which could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income for additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements the consumer portfolio segments consist of smallerbalance homogeneous loans within our automotive finance operations mortgage finance operations and consumer unsecured lending operations which is included within

risk characteristics loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the consumer portfolio segments refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements the commercial portfolio segment is primarily composed of largerbalance nonhomogeneous exposures within our automotive finance

allowances for commercial loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the observable market price or the fair value of collateral whichever is determined to be the most appropriate estimated costs to sell the collateral on an undiscounted basis are included in the impairment measurement when appropriate loans that share similar risk characteristics are pooled and evaluated collectively for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the commercial portfolio segment refer to note of the condensed consolidated financial statements the determination of the allowance is influenced by numerous assumptions and many factors that may materially affect estimates of loss including changes in lgd pd and rating migration the critical assumptions underlying the allowance include i segmentation of each portfolio based on common risk characteristics ii the development of reasonable and supportable forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions and iii evaluation by management of borrower collateral and geographic information management monitors the adequacy of the allowance and makes adjustments
