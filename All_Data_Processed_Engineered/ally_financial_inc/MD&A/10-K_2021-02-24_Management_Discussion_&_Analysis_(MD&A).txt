mean on a straightline basis over a 24month period and data from the historical mean will be calculated from january through the most current period which includes data points from the most recent recessionary period our quantitatively determined allowance under cecl is impacted by certain forecasted economic factors as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements for

reflected in quantitatively derived results such as the impacts associated with covid19 we also monitor model performance using model error and related assessments and we may incorporate qualitative reserves to adjust our quantitatively determined allowance if we observe deterioration in model performance covid19 impacts during the second half of march the economy experienced a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment driven by the covid19 pandemic resulting in notable adverse changes to forecasted economic variables that are utilized in our modeling processes given the fact that the macroeconomic information utilized in our quantitative allowance processes did not fully reflect the rapidly evolving economic changes resulting from the covid19 pandemic we utilized our qualitative allowance framework to ensure the total reserve under cecl reflected the most current forecast of the broader macroeconomic environment to help inform our forecast we considered publicly published broadly available stressed macroeconomic data including the moodys forecast from march that reflected the most recent available information that considered the evolving impacts of developments from the covid19 pandemic as of march in order to support the qualitative adjustments incorporated into our total allowance stressed macroeconomic variables that we utilized as of march include the following among others unemployment rate approaching significant gdp contraction quarteroverquarter and declining new light vehicle sales our qualitatively determined allowance associated with deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook from covid19 resulted in provision expense of million which was incremental to our modeled reserves through june forecasted economic variables utilized in our allowance modeling processes were updated to reflect the current macroeconomic environment and our future expectations which included but were not limited to the following the unemployment rate rising to a peak of approximately declining to approximately by the end of before subsequently migrating to our historical mean of approximately by the middle of significant nearterm gdp contraction and a continuation of lower levels of new light vehicle sales the updated economic forecast resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan losses informed through our modeling process as compared to the period ending march using our qualitative allowance framework we reassessed and adjusted levels to reflect our current estimate of credit losses in our portfolios which considered among other things idiosyncratic risks as well as performance of our portfolio subject to our deferral programs through september forecasted economic variables utilized in our allowance modeling processes were updated to reflect the current macroeconomic environment and our future expectations which included but were not limited to the following the unemployment rate moderating to approximately in september after reaching yeartodate highs of nearly in april declining to approximately by the end of before migrating downward to our historical mean of approximately by the third quarter of a significant near term recovery in gdp as measured on a quarteroverquarter seasonally adjusted annualized rate basis and a recovery of new light vehicle sales on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate basis of approximately million units by the end of in addition to updating the macroeconomic variables for our quantitative processes we reassessed reserves under our qualitative framework for potential adjustment during the quarter ended september the improvement in the macroeconomic outlook through our modeling processes resulted in a decrease in reserves that was more than offset by other factors specifically the significant increase in end of period balances in our consumer automotive portfolio through december forecasted economic variables utilized in our quantitative allowance processes were updated to reflect the current macroeconomic environment and our future expectations which included but were not limited to the following the unemployment rate declining to approximately by the end of which is consistent with our historical mean of approximately starting in the fourth quarter of stable gdp growth over as measured on a quarteroverquarter seasonally adjusted annualized rate basis and increases in new light vehicle sales on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate basis to approximately million units by the end of given the overall improvement in the macroeconomic variables quarteroverquarter it resulted in a decrease in the allowance for loan losses through our quantitative reserving process using our qualitative allowance framework we reassessed and adjusted levels by incorporating uncertainty and volatility in the macroeconomic environment due to the covid19 pandemic which partially offset the decreases in reserves from our quantitative process as a result our

without readily determinable fair market values refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information we may experience changes in the valuation of these investments which may cause volatility in our earnings the composition of our balance sheet including shorterduration consumer automotive loans and variablerate commercial loans coupled with the continued funding shift

transition program that devotes numerous resources throughout all levels of the organization to actively identify assess monitor and mitigate risks associated with this transition our program spans across impacted business lines and functions to evaluate risks associated with the transition while taking into account specific considerations related to our customers products and instruments and counterparty exposures through this program we continue to assess and plan for potential impacts to our existing and future contracts with customers and counterparties financial forecasts operational processes technology modeling and vendor relationships our program is also subject to the governance and oversight of our board through the rc and certain executive committees including the alco and the ermc our current exposure to liborbased contracts is concentrated within certain of our finance receivables and loans primarily related to commercial automotive loans corporatefinance loans and mortgage loans among other arrangements our commercial automotive loan portfolio is primarily composed of wholesale floorplan financing to automotive dealers a significant portion of our wholesale floorplan finance receivables are currently invoiced utilizing a liborbased reference rate and as such represents our largest exposure to libor based on notional dollar amount smaller loan portfolios that utilize contracts containing liborbased reference rates include our corporatefinance loans and lending commitments and our adjustablerate mortgage loans with respect to our liabilities we have issued trust preferred securities with an interest rate linked to libor and also have secured facilities and certain assetbacked securitizations that also contain liborbased reference rates we are taking steps to prepare for libors discontinuance through monitoring industry developments and their potential impact to us ensuring the inclusion of libor fallback language within our contracts and continuing to reduce our libor exposure through strategic actions for example in december we executed the sale of a pool of adjustablerate mortgage loans that are tied to libor and have ceased funding mortgage loans using libor we are evaluating the prime rate and sofr among other alternatives and actions as alternative reference rates for our customers and are taking steps to assess the operational financial and various other impacts this change could have across each of our business lines in the fourth quarter of we began offering conforming adjustablerate mortgage loans using sofr through our directtoconsumer channel which are held for sale we are also actively assessing how the discontinuation of libor could impact accounting and financial reporting including but not limited to potential impacts to our hedge accounting valuation or modeling or impacts associated with modifying the terms of our loan agreements or debt instruments with our customers or counterparties we also continue to monitor the activities of the standard setters such as the fasb which has issued new accounting standard updates that provide targeted relief related to the transition away from libor for example the fasb issued asu derivatives and hedging topic inclusion of the secured overnight financing rate sofr overnight index swap ois rate as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes which permits the use of the ois rate based on the sofr to be designated as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes in addition the fasb issued asu reference rate reform topic facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting which is intended to help facilitate the market transition from existing reference interest rates to alternative reference interest rates the amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying gaap to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met the amendments primarily include relief related to contract modifications hedging relationships and it also provides a onetime election for the sale or transfer of debt securities classified as heldtomaturity this guidance is effective immediately and the amendments may be applied prospectively through december in january the fasb issued asu reference rate reform topic scope which clarified the scope of asu indicating that certain optional expedients and exceptions included in asu are applicable to derivative instruments affected by the marketwide change in interest rates used for discounting margining or contract price

instruments net financing revenue sensitivity analysis interest rate risk represents one of our most significant exposures to market risk we actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings we use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments we prepare forwardlooking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth assetliability positioning and interest rates based on the implied forward curve the analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and noncontractual maturities we continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing actions simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast the changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets liabilities and offbalancesheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates the net financing revenue sensitivity tests measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following months we test a number of alternative rate scenarios including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types relative to our baseline forecast which is based on the implied forward curve our net financing revenue over the next months would decrease by million if interest rates remain unchanged managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k the following table presents the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net financing revenue over the next months assuming various shocks to the implied market forward curve as of december and december table start gradual a instantaneous change in interest rates in millions december basis points basis points basis points b december basis points basis points basis points table end a gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over months b with rates at or near historical lows a scenario with rates declining basis points is being utilized which management believes is more meaningful to understand exposure to lower rates in the current market rate environment rather than the down basis point scenario our models currently assume rates do not go below zero the implied forward rate curve was significantly lower across all tenors compared to december as interest rates were at or near historical lows across the curve the impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections as of december the expected benefit of an upward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario has increased primarily due to changes to our derivative hedging position higher cash balances as well as our continued shift in funding to retail deposits the exposure in the downward instantaneous interest rate shock scenario is largely driven by mortgage prepayment risk and is muted as our models assume rates do not go below zero our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixedrate assets and fixedrate debt instruments and payfixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floatingrate debt instruments we also have the ability to utilize interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floatingrate assets the size maturity and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet alm objectives and interest rate environment evolve over time operating lease residual risk management we are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio this operating lease residual risk represents the possibility that the actual proceeds realized upon the sale of returned vehicles will be lower than the projection of these values used in establishing the pricing at lease inception however in certain instances some automotive manufacturers have provided their guarantee for portions of our residual exposure as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements our operating lease portfolio net of accumulated depreciation was billion and billion as of december and december respectively the expected lease residual value of our operating lease portfolio at scheduled termination was billion and billion as of december and december respectively for information on our valuation of automotive operating lease residuals including periodic revisions through adjustments to depreciation expense based on current and forecasted market conditions refer to the section titled critical accounting estimates valuation of automotive operating lease assets and residuals within this mda priced residual value projections at contract inception we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the leased vehicle this evaluation uses a proprietary model which includes variables such as age expected mileage seasonality segment factors vehicle type economic indicators production cycle automotive manufacturer incentives and unanticipated shifts in used vehicle supply as well as expert judgment this internally generated data is compared against thirdparty independent data for reasonableness periodically we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense over the remaining life of the contract as necessary at termination our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense remarketing abilities our ability to efficiently process and effectively market offlease vehicles affects the disposal costs and the proceeds realized from vehicle sales vehicles can be remarketed through auction internet and physical sale to dealer sale to lessee and other methods the results within these channels vary with physical auction typically resulting in the lowestpriced outcome managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs automotive manufacturers influence operating lease residual results in the following ways the brand image of automotive manufacturers and consumer demand for their products affects residual risk the discontinuation of or stylistic changes to a certain make or model may affect the value of existing vehicles automotive manufacturer marketing programs may influence the used vehicle market for those vehicles through programs such as incentives on new vehicles programs designed to encourage lessees to terminate their operating leases early in conjunction with the acquisition of a new vehicle referred to as pullahead programs and special rate used vehicle programs used vehicle market we have exposure to changes in used vehicle prices general economic conditions used vehicle supply

offlease vehicles terminated in units average gain per vehicle per unit method of vehicle sales auction internet physical sale to dealer lessee and other table end we recognized an average gain per vehicle of for the year ended december compared to an average gain per vehicle of for the same period in the increases in remarketing performance were primarily due to continued new vehicle supply constraints and an increase in demand for used vehicles during the second half of the year the number of offlease vehicles remarketed during the year ended december decreased compared to the same period in primarily due to reduced early termination activity resulting from continued new vehicle supply constraints we expect positive trends in remarketing performance to continue in the near term and as a result have adjusted the rate of depreciation expense to recognize lower lifetime depreciation on vehicles scheduled to terminate through december to support our customers and help mitigate lease residual risk we deferred lease payments without fees for up to days for any consumer requesting assistance related to the covid19 pandemic approximately of our lease customers enrolled in this lease modification program and approximately of these customers were granted a 120day deferral at the time of enrollment as of december substantially all of these customers had exited the program and of these approximately had paid in full and terminated their leases of the customers that had exited the program with outstanding lease obligations were current on their lease obligations as of

managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k tenor ranging from days to two years and allowing for additional funding during the commitment periodor they can be amortizing and not allow for any further funding after the commitment period at december all of our million of capacity was revolving and of this balance million was from facilities with a remaining tenor greater than days our securitizations of commercial automotive loans are issued through a single master trust and include creditenhancement triggers as well as earlyrepayment triggers referred to as early amortization events following an early amortization event principal collections on the loans in the applicable securitizations are applied to repay principal of the trusts assetbacked securities rather than to purchase newly originated loans one of the early amortization events is based on the rates of inventory turnover at our dealer customers referred to as payment rates because the covid19 pandemic is placing downward pressure on the automotive sales of dealers and therefore their rate of inventory turnover an increased risk exists that an early amortization event could occur in such a case our ability to issue new securitizations out of this trust would be constrained or eliminated and our ability to fund commercial automotive loans through the securitization market could be delayed while we establish a new trust in addition the mere occurrence of an early amortization event could impair our ability to access the securitization market or increase our cost to do so at this time none of these securitizations have experienced an early amortization event the majority of our securitizations including our secured bilateral financing facilities involve consumer automotive loans we retain exposure to the nonperformance of these loans through subordinated retained interests in the securitizations as well as obligations to repurchase loans affected by breaches of representations warranties or covenants the secured bilateral financing facilities also include creditenhancement triggers and revolving period termination events based on the nonperformance of loans with the covid19 pandemic adversely affecting some of our consumer automotive customers and with a significant number of them having enrolled in our loandeferral program these securitizations may become more likely to experience a deterioration in loan performance and downgrades by rating agencies in addition the secured bilateral financing facilities may become more likely to experience the activation of creditenhancement triggers and revolving period termination events any of these outcomes could have negative impacts on noteholders and us including in our case a potential for higher pricing and less market access for future securitizations we also have access to funding through advances with the fhlb these advances are primarily secured by consumer mortgage finance receivables and loans and investment securities as of december we had pledged billion of assets to the fhlb resulting in billion in total funding capacity with billion of debt outstanding at december billion of

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements critical accounting estimates are described in this section an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made if actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows our management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to these estimates allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses the allowance to reflect the net amount expected to be collected from our lending portfolios the allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations using relevant available information which includes both internal and external sources relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions additions and reductions to the allowance are charged to current period earnings through the provision for credit losses amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance net of amounts recovered on previously chargedoff accounts expected recoveries do not exceed the total of amounts chargedoff or expected to be chargedoff the allowance is measured using statisticallyestimated models that are designed to correlate customer and collateral quality as well as certain macroeconomic variables to expected future credit losses the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the next months beyond this forecast period we revert to a historical average for each of the variables on a straightline basis over months the allowance reflects managements estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment which could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income for additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes refer to note to the consolidated financial statements the consumer portfolio segments consist of loans that generally share similar risk characteristics within our automotive finance operations mortgage finance operations and consumer unsecured lending operations which is included within corporate and other the allowance model for each consumer portfolio segment is calculated using proprietary statistical models and other risk indicators applied to pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the consumer portfolio segments refer to note to the consolidated financial statements the commercial portfolio segment is composed of loans which may or may not share similar risk characteristics within our automotive finance operations and corporate finance operations loans that have similar risk characteristics are pooled and evaluated collectively for loan losses using proprietary risk rating models loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually credit losses for loans evaluated individually within this segment are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the observable market price or the fair value of collateral whichever is determined to be the most appropriate estimated costs to sell the collateral on an undiscounted basis are included in the measurement if we intend to sell the underlying collateral as opposed to operating it for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the commercial portfolio segment refer to note to the consolidated financial statements the determination of the allowance is influenced by numerous assumptions and factors that may materially affect estimates of loss the critical assumptions underlying the allowance include i segmentation of each portfolio based on common risk characteristics ii the development of reasonable and supportable forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions and iii evaluation by management of borrower collateral and geographic information management monitors the adequacy of the allowance and makes adjustments as the assumptions in the underlying analyses change to reflect an estimate of expected lifetime loan losses at the reporting date based on the best information available at that time valuation of automotive operating lease assets and residuals we have significant investments in vehicles in our operating lease portfolio in accounting for operating leases management must make a determination at the beginning of the operating lease contract of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease residual value represents an estimate of the market value of the vehicle at the end of the lease term at contract inception we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the vehicle this evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model which includes variables such as age expected mileage seasonality segment factors vehicle type economic indicators production cycle automotive manufacturer incentives and shifts in used vehicle supply this internally generated data is compared against thirdparty managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k independent data for reasonableness the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus rental charges however since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of operating lease assets to account for residual risk we depreciate automotive operating lease assets to expected realizable value on a straightline basis over the lease term the estimated realizable value is initially based on the residual value established at contract inception periodically we review the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and other relevant data points and adjust depreciation expense as necessary over the remaining term of the lease impairment of operating lease assets is assessed upon the occurrence of a triggering event triggering events are systemic observed events impacting the used vehicle market such as shocks to oil and gas prices that may indicate impairment of the operating lease asset impairment is determined to exist if the expected undiscounted cash flows generated from the operating lease assets are less than the carrying value of the operating lease assets if the operating lease assets are impaired they are written down to their fair value as estimated by discounted cash flows there were no such impairment charges in or our depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers managements expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values the critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automotive operating lease assets include i estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values ii proper identification and estimation of business conditions iii our remarketing abilities and iv automotive manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the operating lease residual value expected residual values include estimates of payments from automotive manufacturers related to residual support and risksharing agreements if any to the extent an automotive manufacturer is not able to fully honor its obligation relative to these agreements our depreciation expense would be negatively impacted fair value of financial instruments we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain instruments and to determine fair value disclosures refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized we follow the fair value hierarchy set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in order to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value we review and modify as necessary our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis which can result in reclassifications between hierarchy levels we have numerous internal controls in place to address risks inherent in estimating fair value measurements significant fair value measurements are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval we have an established risk management policy and model validation program this model validation program establishes a controlled environment for the development implementation and operation of models used to generate fair value measurements and change procedures further this program uses a riskbased approach to determine the frequency at which models are to be independently reviewed and validated additionally a wide array of operational controls governs fair value measurements including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurement models for example we backtest the internal assumptions used within models against actual performance we also monitor the market for recent trades market surveys or other market information that may be used to benchmark model inputs or outputs certain valuations will also be benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available we have scheduled model or input recalibrations that occur on a periodic basis but will recalibrate earlier if significant variances are observed as part of the backtesting or benchmarking noted above considerable judgment is used in forming conclusions from market observable data used to estimate our level fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to our internal valuation models used to estimate our level fair value measurements level inputs such as interest rate movements prepayment speeds credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements and amounts that could be realized determination of provision for income taxes our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes predominantly in the united states significant judgments and estimates are required in determining consolidated income tax expense deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss as of each reporting date we consider existing evidence both positive and negative that could impact our view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets following the sale of our legacy international operations in and we continue to hold unexpired foreign tax credits subject to a partial valuation allowance we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the benefit for certain foreign managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k tax credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized
