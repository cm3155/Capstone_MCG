management capabilities customer and funding needs and operational capabilities this due diligence includes understanding how the chosen reference rate is constructed and being aware of any fragilities associated with that rate and the markets that underlie it the discontinuation of libor or liborbased rates presents risks to our business as further described in the section titled risk factors in part i item of this report in recognition of the significance of libor cessation in july ally formed an enterprisewide libor transition program that devotes numerous resources throughout all levels of the organization to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates our program spans impacted business lines and functions to evaluate risks associated with the transition while taking into account specific considerations related to our customers products and instruments and counterparty exposures through this program we continue to plan for and guide the transition away from libor to alternative reference rates and evaluate the impacts and potential impacts to our existing and future contracts with customers and counterparties financial forecasts operational processes technology modeling and vendor relationships our program is also subject to the governance and oversight of our board through the rc and certain executive committees including the alco and the ermc we continue to make progress on our transition efforts including developing new products and agreements that utilize alternative reference rates such as prime and sofr and engaging our commercial customers with transitioning their existing financing agreements from libor to alternative rates as appropriate during we accelerated our efforts of transitioning existing bilateral commercial automotive lending arrangements from libor to prime continued originating corporatefinance loans using sofr and did not enter into new contracts that use us dollar libor as a reference rate in alignment with the november guidance and subsequent clarifications from us banking regulators our ongoing libor transition program includes monitoring of our operations and the progress of our broader transition efforts as part of this we collect and analyze businessline level data about our libor exposure on a monthly basis our exposure to liborbased contracts is significantly concentrated within certain of our finance receivables and loans primarily related to corporatefinance and commercial automotive loans we also have a smaller portfolio of adjustablerate mortgage loans that utilize contracts containing liborbased reference rates as of december we had a notional amount of billion of loan exposure that references libor compared to billion as of december these notional amounts included approximately billion and billion of associated managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k liborbased loans outstanding as of december and respectively we are planning to

respectively for additional information on equity securities without a readily determinable fair value refer to note to the consolidated financial statements net financing revenue sensitivity analysis interest rate risk represents one of our most significant exposures to market risk we actively monitor the level of exposure to movements in interest rates and take actions to mitigate adverse impacts these movements may have on future earnings we use a sensitivity analysis of net financing revenue as our primary metric to measure and manage the interest rate risk of our financial instruments we prepare forwardlooking baseline forecasts of net financing revenue taking into consideration anticipated future business growth assetliability positioning and interest rates based on the implied forward curve the analysis is highly dependent upon a variety of assumptions including the repricing characteristics of retail deposits with both contractual and noncontractual maturities we continually monitor industry and competitive repricing activity along with other market factors when contemplating deposit pricing assumptions simulations are then used to assess changes in net financing revenue in multiple interest rate scenarios relative to the baseline forecast the changes in net financing revenue relative to the baseline are defined as the sensitivity our simulations incorporate contractual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all assets liabilities and offbalance sheet exposures and incorporate the effects of changing interest rates on the prepayment and attrition rates of certain assets and liabilities our simulation does not assume any specific future actions are taken to mitigate the impacts of changing interest rates the net financing revenue simulations measure the potential change in our pretax net financing revenue over the following months we test a number of alternative rate scenarios including immediate and gradual parallel shocks to the implied market forward curve management also evaluates nonparallel shocks to interest rates and stresses to certain term points on the yield curve in isolation to capture and monitor a number of risk types relative to our baseline forecast our net financing revenue over the next months is expected to increase by million if interest rates remain unchanged due to expected increases in the federal funds rate resulting in an inversion of the yield curve the following table presents the pretax dollar impact to baseline forecasted net financing revenue over the next months assuming various shocks to the implied market forward curve as of december and december table start december december gradual a instantaneous gradual a instantaneous change in interest rates in millions in millions basis points basis points basis points nm nm table end nm not meaningful a gradual changes in interest rates are recognized over months managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k since december the implied forward rate curve has increased flattened and inverted as market expectations for shortterm interest rates have increased more than longterm rates the impact of this change is reflected in our baseline net financing revenue projections as of december we remain liability sensitive to a parallel instantaneous move in interest rates as the assumed repricing of our assets and payfixed swap position is more than offset by assumed repricing of our liabilities our exposure to the downward interest rate shock scenario as of december is not provided because many interest rates were at or near historical lows limiting our models ability to reprice lower our risk position is influenced by the impact of hedging activity which primarily consists of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of certain fixedrate assets and fixedrate debt instruments and payfixed interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges of certain floatingrate debt instruments we also have the ability to use interest rate floor contracts designated as cash flow hedges on certain floatingrate assets the size maturity and mix of our hedging activities are adjusted as our balance sheet alm objectives and interest rate environment evolve over time our hedging strategies however are not designed to eliminate all interestrate risk and we were adversely affected from rising interest rates in operating lease residual risk management we are exposed to residual risk on vehicles in the consumer operating lease portfolio this operating lease residual risk represents the possibility that the actual proceeds realized upon the sale of returned vehicles will be lower than the projection of these values used in establishing the pricing at lease inception our operating lease portfolio net of accumulated depreciation was billion and billion as of december and december respectively the expected lease residual value of our operating lease portfolio at scheduled termination was billion and billion as of december and december respectively for information on our valuation of automotive operating lease residuals including periodic revisions through adjustments to depreciation expense based on current and forecasted market conditions refer to the section titled critical accounting estimates valuation of automotive operating lease assets and residuals within this mda priced residual value projections at contract inception we determine pricing based on the projected residual value of the leased vehicle this evaluation uses a proprietary model which includes variables such as age expected mileage seasonality segment factors vehicle type economic indicators production cycle automotive manufacturer incentives and unanticipated shifts in used vehicle supply as well as expert judgment this internally generated data is compared against thirdparty independent data for reasonableness periodically we revise the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and adjust depreciation expense over the remaining life of the contract as necessary at termination our actual sales proceeds from remarketing the vehicle may be higher or lower than the estimated residual value resulting in a gain or loss on remarketing recorded through depreciation expense remarketing abilities our ability to efficiently process and effectively market offlease vehicles affects the disposal costs and the proceeds realized from vehicle sales vehicles can be remarketed through auction internet and physical sale to dealer sale to lessee and other methods the results within these channels vary with physical auction typically resulting in the lowestpriced outcome manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs automotive manufacturers influence operating lease residual results in the following ways the brand image of automotive manufacturers and consumer demand for their products affects residual risk the discontinuation of or stylistic changes to a certain make or model may affect the value of existing vehicles automotive manufacturer marketing programs may influence the used vehicle market for those vehicles through programs such as incentives on new vehicles programs designed to encourage lessees to terminate their operating leases early in conjunction with the acquisition of a new vehicle referred to as pullahead programs and special rate used vehicle programs used vehicle market we have exposure to changes in used vehicle prices general economic conditions used vehicle supply and demand and new vehicle availability and market prices heavily influence used vehicle prices managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k operating lease vehicle terminations and remarketing the following table summarizes the volume of operating lease terminations and average gain per vehicle as well as our methods of vehicle sales at lease termination stated as a percentage of total operating lease vehicle disposals table start year ended december offlease vehicles terminated in units average gain per vehicle per unit method of vehicle sales sale to dealer lessee and other auction internet physical table end we recognized an average gain per vehicle of for the year ended december compared to an average gain per vehicle of and in and respectively the number of offlease vehicles remarketed during the year ended december decreased compared to reflecting the normalization of termination volume to precovid19 levels the decrease in remarketing performance was primarily due to a shift in offlease vehicle disposition channel mix the remarketing channel mix for dealer and lessee buyouts increased during the year ended december primarily due to supply constraints increasing dealer demand for offlease vehicles as well as increases in new vehicle prices that are causing a shift in consumer preference the shift in offlease vehicle disposition may limit our ability to optimize remarketing proceeds but it is expected to moderate in the near term in connection with declining used vehicle values which would soften any resulting adverse impacts to remarketing performance operating lease portfolio mix we monitor the concentration of our outstanding operating leases our exposure to stellantis vehicles represented approximately and of our

overview the purpose of liquidity management is to enable us to meet loan and operating lease demand debt maturities deposit withdrawals and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions as well as periods of economic or financial stress our primary objective is to maintain costeffective stable and diverse sources of funding capable of sustaining the organization throughout all market cycles sources of funding include both retail and brokered deposits and secured and unsecured marketbased funding across various maturity interest rate and investor profiles additional liquidity is available through a pool of unencumbered highly liquid securities repurchase agreements and advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh we define liquidity risk as the risk that an institutions financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the actual or perceived inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions liquidity risk can arise from a variety of institutionspecific or marketrelated events that could have a negative impact on cash flows available to the organization effective management of liquidity risk positions an organization to meet cash flow obligations caused by unanticipated events managing liquidity needs and contingent funding exposures has proven essential to the solvency of financial institutions the alco chaired by the corporate treasurer is responsible for overseeing our funding and liquidity strategies corporate treasury is responsible for managing our liquidity positions within limits approved by alco the ermc and the rc as part of managing liquidity risk corporate treasury prepares monthly forecasts depicting anticipated funding needs and sources of funds executes our funding strategies and manages liquidity under normal as well as more severely stressed macroeconomic environments oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk are provided by independent risk management the monthly liquidity forecasts demonstrate our ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet loan and operating lease demand debt maturities deposit withdrawals and other cash commitments under normal operating conditions throughout the forecast horizon currently through december refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the scheduled maturity of longterm debt as of december in recent years we have become less reliant on marketbased funding reducing our exposure to disruptions in wholesale funding markets funding strategy liquidity and ongoing profitability are largely dependent on the timely and costeffective access to retail deposits and funding in various segments of the capital markets we focus on maintaining diversified funding sources across a broad base of depositors lenders and investors to meet liquidity needs throughout different economic cycles including periods of financial distress these funding sources include retail and brokered deposits public and private assetbacked securitizations unsecured debt fhlb advances and repurchase agreements our access to diversified funding sources enhances funding flexibility and results in a more costeffective funding strategy over the long term we evaluate funding markets on an ongoing basis to achieve an appropriate balance of unsecured and secured funding sources and maturity profiles we manage our funding to achieve a wellbalanced portfolio across a spectrum of risk maturity and costoffunds characteristics optimizing funding at ally bank continues to be a key part of our longterm liquidity strategy we optimize our funding sources at ally bank by prioritizing retail deposits maintaining active securitization programs managing a prudent maturity profile of our brokered deposit portfolio utilizing repurchase agreements and continuing to access funds from the fhlb essentially all asset originations are directed to ally bank to reduce parent company exposures and funding requirements and to utilize our growing consumer deposittaking capabilities this allows us to use bank funding for substantially all our automotive finance and other assets and to provide a sustainable longterm funding channel for the business while also improving the cost of funds for the enterprise liquidity risk management multiple metrics are used to measure liquidity risk manage the liquidity position identify related trends and monitor these trends and metrics against established limits these metrics include comprehensive stress tests that measure the sufficiency of the liquidity portfolio over stressed horizons ranging from overnight to months stability ratios that measure longerterm structural liquidity and concentration ratios that enable prudent funding diversification in addition we have established internal management routines designed to review all aspects of liquidity and funding plans evaluate the adequacy of liquidity buffers review stress testing results and assist management in the execution of its funding strategy and riskmanagement accountabilities our liquidity stress testing is designed to allow us to operate our businesses and to meet our contractual and contingent obligations including unsecured debt

of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions on the basis of information available at the time of the financial statements in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of these statements our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements certain of our critical accounting policies requiring significant management assumptions and judgment are described in this section an accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made if actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows our management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to these estimates allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses the allowance to reflect the net amount expected to be collected from our lending portfolios the allowance is maintained at a level that management considers to be adequate based upon ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations using relevant available information the allowance is measured using statistically estimated models that are designed to correlate customer and collateral quality as well as certain macroeconomic variables to expected future credit losses the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the next months beyond this forecast period we revert to a historical average for each of the variables on a straightline basis over months our baseline macroeconomic forecast is consistent with the 50th percentile in a distribution of possible economic outcomes the consumer portfolio segments consist of loans that generally share similar risk characteristics within our automotive finance operations mortgage finance operations and our personal lending and credit card operations both of which are included within corporate and other for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the consumer portfolio segments refer to note to the consolidated financial statements managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k the commercial portfolio segment is composed of loans that may or may not share similar risk characteristics within our automotive finance operations and corporate finance operations for additional information regarding the allowance calculation for the commercial portfolio segment refer to note to the consolidated financial statements the determination of the allowance is influenced by numerous assumptions and factors that may materially affect estimates of loss the critical assumptions underlying the allowance include i segmentation of each portfolio based on common risk characteristics ii the development of reasonable and supportable forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions and iii evaluation by management of borrower collateral and geographic information management monitors the adequacy of the allowance and makes adjustments as the assumptions in the underlying analyses change to reflect an estimate of expected lifetime loan losses at the reporting date based on the best information available at that time the allowance reflects managements estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of our lending portfolio and involves significant judgment which could materially affect the provision for credit losses and therefore net income for additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes allowance for loan losses and other credit quality indicators refer to note to the consolidated financial statements macroeconomic sensitivity analysis we perform a sensitivity analysis using scenarios derived from widely published macroeconomic forecasts to quantify the sensitivity of our baseline forecast to alternative changes in macroeconomic conditions these scenarios are based on fixed probabilities of occurrence the unfavorable or downside scenario is consistent with the 90th percentile in a distribution of possible economic outcomes and implies that there is a chance that the realized economy will be better than the defined path and a chance that the realized economy will be worse than the defined path the alternative unfavorable or alternative downside scenario is consistent with the 96th percentile in a distribution of possible economic outcomes and implies that there is a chance that the realized economy will be better than the defined path and a chance that the realized economy will be worse than the defined path as of december results of this sensitivity analysis indicate that the downside scenario would increase our allowance for loan losses by and the alternative unfavorable scenario would increase our allowance for loan losses by these results are estimates that are directly tied to the timing severity and duration of changes in the independently and instantaneously shocked macroeconomic scenario actual loss sensitivities and resulting estimates of consolidated allowance for loan losses may be influenced by numerous other factors including but not limited to the actual evaluation of macroeconomic conditions future government and management actions and other quantitative and qualitative information and adjustments therefore this sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and is not intended to represent our expectation of changes in our estimate of expected credit losses due to a change in the macroeconomic environment valuation of automotive operating lease assets and residuals we have significant investments in vehicles in our operating lease portfolio in accounting for operating leases management must make a determination at the beginning of the operating lease contract of the estimated realizable value ie residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease this evaluation is primarily based on a proprietary model which includes variables such as age of the vehicle expected mileage seasonality segment factors vehicle type economic indicators production cycle automotive manufacturer incentives and shifts in used vehicle supply this internally generated data is compared against thirdparty independent data for reasonableness the customer is obligated to make payments during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus rental charges however since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract we are exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the value of the vehicle is below the residual value estimated at contract inception for additional information regarding residual value refer to note to the consolidated financial statements to account for residual risk we depreciate automotive operating lease assets to expected realizable value on a straightline basis over the lease term the estimated realizable value is initially based on the expected residual value established at contract inception periodically we review the projected value of the leased vehicle at termination based on current market conditions and other relevant data points and adjust depreciation expense as necessary over the remaining term of the lease management periodically performs a detailed review of the estimated realizable value of vehicles to assess the appropriateness of the carrying value of operating lease assets impairment of operating lease assets is assessed upon the occurrence of a triggering event triggering events are systemic observed events impacting the used vehicle market such as shocks to oil and gas prices that may indicate impairment of the operating lease asset for additional information regarding operating lease impairment refer to note to the consolidated financial statements our depreciation methodology for operating lease assets considers managements expectation of the value of the vehicles upon lease termination which is based on numerous assumptions and factors influencing used vehicle values the critical assumptions underlying the estimated carrying value of automotive operating lease assets include i estimated market value information obtained and used by management in estimating residual values ii proper identification and estimation of business conditions iii our remarketing abilities and iv automotive manufacturer vehicle and marketing programs changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the operating lease residual value managements discussion and analysis ally financial inc form 10k lessees have the first opportunity to purchase the offlease vehicle at the end of the lease term for the price stated in the lease agreement if the lessee declines to purchase the offlease vehicle the dealer is offered the opportunity to purchase the vehicle directly from us at a price we define if both the lessee and the dealer decline their options to purchase we remarket the offlease vehicle at auction at this point we are exposed to a risk of loss if the realized values of our leased vehicles were to decline below our estimated realizable values we would incur million of incremental depreciation expense over the remaining life of our operating lease portfolio this is based on the improbable event that all vehicles were remarketed at auction due to lessees and dealers foregoing their purchase options fair value of financial instruments we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain instruments and to determine fair value disclosures refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized we follow the fair value hierarchy set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements in order to prioritize the inputs utilized to measure fair value we review and modify as necessary our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis which can result in reclassifications between hierarchy levels we have numerous internal controls in place to address risks inherent in estimating fair value measurements significant fair value measurements are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval we have an established risk management policy and model validation program this model validation program establishes a controlled environment for the development implementation and operation of models used to generate fair value measurements and change procedures further this program uses a riskbased approach to determine the frequency at which models are to be independently reviewed and validated additionally a wide array of operational controls governs fair value measurements including controls over the inputs into and the outputs from the fair value measurement models for example we backtest the internal assumptions used within models against actual performance we also monitor the market for recent trades market surveys or other market information that may be used to benchmark model inputs or outputs certain valuations will also be benchmarked to market indices when appropriate and available we have scheduled model or input recalibrations that occur on a periodic basis but will recalibrate earlier if significant variances are observed as part of the backtesting or benchmarking noted above considerable judgment is used in forming conclusions from market observable data used to estimate our level fair value measurements and in estimating inputs to our internal valuation models used to estimate our level fair value measurements level inputs such as interest rate movements prepayment speeds credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements and amounts that could be realized refer to the section titled fair value sensitivity analysis within this mda for a sensitivity analysis of changes in

or changes in the tax laws may result in additional accrual of income tax expense or benefit which could be material to our reported results we consistently monitor new and reassess existing tax laws for changes and adjust our tax estimates accordingly our provision for income taxes is comprised of current and deferred income taxes deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operations in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss as of each reporting date we consider existing evidence both positive and negative that could impact our view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets we currently hold
