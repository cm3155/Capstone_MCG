item risk factors we face many risks and uncertainties any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition including capital and liquidity or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in ally we describe certain of these risks and uncertainties in this section although we may be adversely affected by other risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us that we have failed to appreciate or that we currently consider immaterial these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the mda in part ii item of this report and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto this annual report on s or declines in the strength of national or local economies could decrease demand for our products and services increase the amount and rate of delinquencies and losses raise our operating and other expenses and negatively impact the returns on and the value of our loans investment portfolio and other assets further if a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices or other adverse conditions were to lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases or prices our automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer considerably in addition concerns about the pace of economic growth and uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies can result in significant volatility in the financial markets and could impact our ability to obtain costeffective funding if any of these events were to occur or worsen our business results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected geopolitical conditions military conflicts acts or threats of terrorism natural disasters pandemics and other conditions or events beyond our control could adversely affect us geopolitical conditions military conflicts including russias invasion of ukraine acts or threats of terrorism natural disasters pandemics including the covid19 pandemic and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or prospects for example military conflicts acts or threats of terrorism and political financial or military actions taken in response could adversely affect general economic business or market conditions and in turn us especially as an intermediary within the financial system in addition nation states engaged in warfare or other hostile actions may directly or indirectly use cyberattacks against financial systems and financialservices companies like us to exert pressure on one another or other countries with influence or interests at stake we also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel a significant number of our employees or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic natural disaster war act of terrorism accident or similar cause these same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well as their own thirdparty service providers and counterparties the most notable impact of covid19 on our results of operations was a significant increase in our provision expense for credit losses during the year ended december this was primarily driven by incremental reserves associated with a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions such as unemployment following the onset of the pandemic in the case of russias invasion of ukraine security risks as well as increases in fuel and other commodity costs supplychain disruptions and associated inflationary pressures have impacted our business the most these conditions and events and others like them are highly complex and inherently uncertain and their effect on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects in the future cannot be reliably predicted our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate foreign exchange and market risks which could adversely affect our financial results we employ various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate foreign exchange and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities our hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors if any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and other market factors we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition in addition we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties on acceptable terms or at all which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies our hedging strategies are not designed to eliminate all interest rate foreign exchange and market risks and we were adversely impacted from rising interest rates in refer to the risk factors titled the levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition and significant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results we use estimates and assumptions in determining the value or amount of many of our assets and liabilities if our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect our cash flow profitability financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected we use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets including retained interests from securitizations loans held for sale and other investments that do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded we also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of our operating lease assets in addition we use estimates and assumptions in determining our allowance for loan losses reserves for legal matters insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred but not reported including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements refer to the section titled critical accounting estimates in the mda that follows our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons for example they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control such as macroeconomic conditions and their impact on automotive dealers and retailers and consumers and often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables factors and other assumptions assumptions and estimates are also far more difficult during periods when markets are dislocated or illiquid and when comparable historical data is lacking such as during the covid19 pandemic and the subsequent recovery as a result our actual experience may differ substantially from these estimates and assumptions a meaningful difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect ally financial inc form 10k our cash flow profitability financial condition and prospects and may increase the volatility of our financial results in addition several different judgments associated with assumptions or estimates could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported significant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results market prices for investment securities nonmarketable equity investments and other financial assets are subject to considerable fluctuation fluctuations may result for example from perceived changes in the value of the asset the relative price of alternative investments the usual volume of trading in the asset shifts in investor sentiment geopolitical events actual or expected changes in monetary or fiscal policies and general market conditions such as inflation due to these kinds of fluctuations the amount that we realize in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the last reported value and could negatively affect our financial results for example because nonmarketable equity investments are not readily salable in capital markets their values are particularly susceptible to extreme volatility additionally negative fluctuations in the value of availableforsale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity for example in we recorded billion of net unrealized losses on our availableforsale securities within accumulated other comprehensive loss refer to the risk factor above titled the levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition for more information on risks associated with increases in interest rates changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported revenues expenses profitability and financial condition our financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap which are periodically revised or expanded the application of us gaap is also subject to varying interpretations over time accordingly we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards such as the fasb the sec banking agencies and our independent registered public accounting firm those changes are beyond our control but could adversely affect our revenues expenses profitability or financial condition for example the adoption of cecl effective january resulted in a significant increase to our allowance for loan losses in refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for financial accounting standards issued by the fasb but not yet adopted by the company the financial system is highly interrelated and the failure of even a single financial institution or other participant in the financial system could adversely affect us the financial system is highly interrelated including as a result of lending trading clearing counterparty and other relationships we have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with a wide variety of financial institutions including brokers dealers commercial banks and investment banks the financial system includes other substantial participants as well including exchanges central counterparties governmentsponsored enterprises insurance companies privateequity funds hedge funds family offices mutual funds and moneymarket funds if any of these institutions or participants were to become or perceived to be unstable were to fail in meeting its obligations in full and on time or were to enter bankruptcy conservatorship or receivership the consequences could ripple throughout the financial system and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or prospects because of interrelationships within the financial system this could occur even if the institution or participant itself were not systemically important or perceived to play a meaningful role in the stable functioning of the financial markets adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in the states where we have loan or operating lease concentrations may negatively affect our business and financial results we are exposed to portfolio concentrations in some states including california texas and florida factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these states including public policies that have the effect of drawing financialservices companies into contentious political or social issues could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to successfully manage issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business or financial results the performance and value of our business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that we may suffer especially as an intermediary within the financial system this harm could arise from negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to adequately address issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally risks to our reputation could arise in any number of contextsfor example stricter regulatory or supervisory environments cyber incidents and other security breaches inabilities to meet customer expectations political controversies and social trends involving financialservices mergers and acquisitions lending or banking practices actual or perceived conflicts of interest failures to prevent money laundering inappropriate conduct by employees inadequate corporate governance and any similar issues affecting our service providers our failure to maintain appropriate esg practices oversight and disclosures could result in reputational harm a loss of customer and investor confidence and adverse business and financial results governments investors customers and the general public are increasingly focused on esg practices oversight and disclosures for us and others in the financialservices industry this focus extends to the practices and disclosures of the customers counterparties and service providers with whom we choose to do business for example while we have a smaller carbon footprint as a digital financial services company and do not have commerciallending relationships with a host of sensitive industries such as those whose products are or are ally financial inc form 10k perceived to be harmful to the environment or the public health the majority of our business and operations are connected to the automotive industry views about esg are diverse dynamic and rapidly changing with a number of competing constituencies if our esg practices oversight and disclosures were considered to be inadequate or inappropriate by governmental officials supervisory authorities investors customers or other constituencies with the ability to affect our business and financial results we could suffer reputational damage a loss of customer and investor confidence and adverse effects on our results of operations and prospects climate change could adversely affect our business operations and reputation a prominent aspect of esg is climate change and the management of climate and related environmental risks the climate and the environment however are extraordinarily complex and impossible to reliably model and as a result related physical and transition risks and the scope and severity of their consequences are pervaded by uncertainty climate change and the transition to a less carbondependent economy may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or prospects due to our concentration in automotive finance and insurance or for entirely different reasons that we cannot yet foresee these physical and transition risks also may have a negative impact on the business operations or financial condition of customers counterparties and service providers on whom we rely in addition climate change may impact the broader economy including through changes to the production allocation and use of energy and disruptions to supply chains if our strategic or tactical responses to these physical and transition risks are or are perceived to be ineffective or insufficient we could be subject to enforcement and other supervisory actions reputational damage a loss of customer or investor confidence difficulty retaining or attracting talented employees or other harm refer to the risk factor above titled our business and financial results may be negatively affected by governmental responses to climate change and related environmental issues for more information on risks associated with governmental responses to climate change risks related to our operations we face a wide array of security risks that could result in business reputational financial regulatory and other harm to us our operating systems and infrastructure as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely are subject to security risks that are rapidly evolving and increasing in scope complexity and frequency this is due in part to the introduction of new technologies the continued expansion of the use of internet and telecommunications technologies including mobile devices to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of hostile statesponsored actors organized crime perpetrators of fraud hackers terrorists and others we along with other financial institutions our service providers and others on whom we rely have been and are expected to continue to be the target of cyberattacks which could include computer viruses malware malicious or destructive code social engineering including phishing or spear phishing attacks denialofservice or denialofinformation attacks ransomware identity theft access violations by employees or vendors attacks on the personal email of employees and ransom demands accompanied by threats to expose security vulnerabilities risks relating to cyberattacks on our service providers and other third parties including supplychain attacks affecting our software and informationtechnology providers have been rising as such attacks become increasingly frequent and severe the development of new technologies as well as the utilization of decentralized technology infrastructures such as our increased utilization of cloud computing and softwaredefined networks could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks we our service providers and others on whom we rely are also exposed to more traditional security threats to physical facilities and personnel these security risks could result in business reputational financial regulatory and other harm to us which could be particularly pronounced due to our being a digital financialservices company with a meaningful dependence on service providers for example if sensitive confidential or proprietary data or other information about us or our customers employees or third parties were improperly disclosed accessed or destroyed because of a security breach we could experience severe business or operational disruptions reputational damage contractual claims supervisory actions or litigation by private plaintiffs as a digital financialservices company and a direct bank with no branch network we may face heightened pressure to resolve security breaches more expeditiously to prevent or mitigate a loss of depositor or customer confidence and if we were to fail to do so our viability as a going concern could be threatened as threats inevitably evolve we expect to continue experiencing increased scrutiny of our security frameworks and protocols by supervisory authorities and others and to continue expending significant resources to enhance our defenses to educate our employees to monitor and support the defenses established by our service providers and others on whom we rely and to investigate and remediate incidents and vulnerabilities as they arise or are identified even so we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches especially because techniques change frequently attacks can be launched with no warning from a wide variety of sources around the globe and attackers often need few resources to extensively probe and exploit vulnerabilities over lengthy periods of time a sophisticated breach moreover may not be identified until well after the attack has occurred and the damage has been caused we also could be adversely affected by security risks faced by others for example a cyberattack or other security breach affecting a service provider or another entity on whom we rely could negatively impact us and our ability to conduct business and operations just as much as a breach affecting us directly further in such a circumstance we may not receive timely notice of or sufficient information about the breach or be able to exert any meaningful control or influence over how and when the breach is addressed in addition a security threat affecting the business community the markets or parts of them may cycle or cascade through the financial system and harm us the mere perception of a security breach involving us or any part of the financial services industry whether or not true also could damage our business operations or reputation many if not all of these risks and uncertainties are some of our most significant and yet beyond our control refer to the section titled risk management in the mda that follows ally financial inc form 10k our operating systems or infrastructure as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely could fail or be interrupted which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and prospects we rely heavily upon communications data management and other operating systems and infrastructureincluding cloudbased servicesto conduct our business and operations which creates meaningful operational risk for us for example during there were a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud service providers any failure of or interruption in these systems or infrastructure or those of our service providers or others on whom we relyincluding as a result of inadequate or failed technology or processes unplanned or unsuccessful updates to technology sudden increases in transaction volume human errors fraud or other misconduct deficiencies in the integration of acquisitions or the commencement of new businesses energy or similar infrastructure outages disruptions in communications networks or systems natural disasters catastrophic events pandemics acts of terrorism political or social unrest external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism cyberattacks such as computer viruses and malware misplaced or lost data or breakdowns in business continuity planscould cause failures or delays in receiving applications for loans and operating leases underwriting or processing loan or operatinglease applications servicing loans and operating leases accessing online accounts processing transactions executing brokerage orders communicating with our customers managing our investment portfolio or otherwise conducting our business and operations these adverse effects could be exacerbated if systems or infrastructure need to be taken offline or meaningfully repaired if backup systems or infrastructure are not adequately redundant and effective for the conduct of our business and operations or if technological or other solutions do not exist or are slow to be developed further to the extent that the systems or infrastructure of service providers or others are involved we may have little or no knowledge control or influence over how and when failures or delays are addressed as a digital financialservices company with a meaningful dependence on service providers we are susceptible to business reputational financial regulatory and other harm as a result of these risks in the ordinary course of our business we collect store process and transmit sensitive confidential or proprietary data and other information including business information intellectual property and the personally identifiable information of customers and employees the secure collection storage processing and transmission of this information are critical to our business and reputation and if any of this information were mishandled misused improperly accessed altered lost or stolen or if related operations were disabled or otherwise disrupted we could suffer significant business reputational financial regulatory and other damage even when a failure of or interruption in operating systems or infrastructure is timely resolved we may need to expend substantial resources in doing so may be required to take actions that could adversely affect customer satisfaction or behavior and may be exposed to reputational damage we also could be exposed to contractual claims supervisory actions or litigation by private plaintiffs we are heavily reliant on technology and a failure in effectively implementing technology initiatives anticipating future technology needs or demands or maintaining rights or interests in associated intellectual property could adversely affect our business or financial results as a digital financialservices company and a direct bank with no branch network we significantly depend on technology to deliver our products and services and to otherwise conduct our business and operations to remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient we invest in system upgrades new solutions cloudbased services and other technology initiatives many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement are tied to critical systems and require substantial financial human and other resources although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives they are not always implemented on time within budget or without negative financial operational or customer impact and do not always perform as we or our customers expect and no assurance can be provided that initiatives in the future will be or will do so we also may not succeed in anticipating or keeping pace with future technology needs the technology demands of customers or the competitive landscape for technology if we were to misstep in any of these areas our business financial results or reputation could be negatively impacted our use of systems and other technologies also depends on rights or interests in the underlying intellectual property which we or our service providers may own or license if we or a service provider were alleged or found to be infringing on the intellectualproperty rights of another person or entity we could be liable for significant damages for past infringement substantial fees for continued use and deprivation of access for limited or extended periods of time without the practical availability of an alternative our enterprise riskmanagement framework or independent riskmanagement function may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss we maintain an enterprise riskmanagement framework that is designed to identify measure assess monitor test control report escalate and mitigate the risks that we face these include credit insuranceunderwriting market liquidity businessstrategic reputation operational informationtechnologycybersecurity compliance and conduct risks the framework incorporates risk culture and incentives risk governance and organization strategy and risk appetite a materialrisk taxonomy key riskmanagement processes and risk capabilities our chief risk officer chief compliance officer and other personnel who make up our independent riskmanagement function are responsible for overseeing and implementing the framework refer to the section titled risk management in the mda that follows we continuously improve the riskmanagement framework in response to internal reviews and assessments evolving industry practices and changes in business and regulatory expectations even with these improvements however the framework cannot guarantee that we will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in our business and operations if conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the framework or its design or implementation the performance and value of our business and operations could be adversely affected an ineffective riskmanagement framework or function also could give rise to enforcement and other supervisory actions damage our reputation and result in private litigation ally financial inc form 10k our business and operations make extensive use of models and we could be adversely affected if our design implementation or use of models is flawed we use quantitative models to price products and services measure risk calculate the quantitative portion of our allowance for loan losses estimate asset and liability values assess capital and liquidity manage our balance sheet create financial forecasts and otherwise conduct our business and operations if the design implementation or use of any of these models is flawed we could make strategic or tactical decisions based on incorrect misleading or incomplete information in addition to the extent that any flawed models or inaccurate model outputs are used in reports to banking agencies or the public we could be subjected to supervisory actions private litigation and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and financial results refer to the section titled risk management in the mda that follows risks related to ownership of our common stock our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares in the future may be limited any future dividends on our common stock or changes in our stockrepurchase program will be determined by our board in its sole discretion and will depend on our business financial condition earnings capital liquidity and other factors at the time in addition any plans to continue dividends or share repurchases in the future will be subject to our stress capital buffer requirement and the frbs review of our annual capital plan which are unpredictable there is no assurance that our board will approve or the frb will permit future dividends or share repurchases refer to the section above titled regulation and supervision in part i item of this report it is possible that any indentures or other financing arrangements that we execute in the future could limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock including our common stock in the event that any of our indentures or other financing arrangements in the future restrict that ability we may be unable to pay dividends unless and until we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those arrangements in addition under delaware law our board may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory surplus which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities in each case at fair market value minus statutory capital or if no surplus exists out of our net profits for the thencurrent or immediately preceding fiscal year further even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and delaware law to pay dividends on our common stock we may not have sufficient cash or regulatory approvals to do so the market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted by antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law that could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of ally or by other banking antitrust or corporate laws that have or are perceived as having an antitakeover effect our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging hindering or preventing an acquisition that the board does not find to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders for example our organizational documents include provisions that limit the liability of our directors provide indemnification to our directors and officers and limit the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders by requiring any requesting stockholders to hold at least of our common stock in the aggregate these provisions alone or together could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of ally or changes in management in addition we are subject to section of the general corporation law of the state of delaware which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any interested stockholder generally defined as a stockholder who owns or more of a corporations voting stock for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except under specified circumstances such as the receipt of prior board approval banking and antitrust laws including associated regulatoryapproval requirements also impose significant restrictions on the acquisition of direct or indirect control over any bhc like ally or any insured depository institution like ally bank refer to the section above titled regulation and supervision in part i item of this report any provision of our organizational documents or applicable law that deters hinders or prevents a nonnegotiated takeover or change in control of ally could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock ally financial inc form 10k
