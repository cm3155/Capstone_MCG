a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition including capital and liquidity or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in ally the section titled risk factors in part ii item of our form 10q for the quarter ended march includes updates to these risks and uncertainties the information presented below provides an update to and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and other information contained in our annual report on form 10k and our form 10q for the quarter ended march except as presented below there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our annual report on form 10k and our form 10q for the quarter ended march the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers and the adverse impacts on our business financial position results of operations and prospects could be significant the spread of covid19 has created a global publichealth crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility and deteriorations in household business economic and market conditions including in the united states where we conduct nearly all of our business the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our capital liquidity and other financial positions and on our business results of operations and prospects will depend on a number of evolving factors including the duration extent and severity of the pandemic covid19 has not yet been contained and could continue to affect significantly more households and businesses the duration and severity of the pandemic remain impossible to predict as the initial slowing of the number of cases nationally has recently reversed and the potential exists for further resurgences to occur the response of governmental and nongovernmental authorities many of their actions have been directed toward curtailing household and business activity to contain covid19 while simultaneously deploying fiscal and monetarypolicy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses these actions have not always been coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions and have varied in scope and intensity over time the effect on our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers covid19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties are affecting individuals households and businesses differently and unevenly many however have changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to restrain or alter commercial and social interactions as a result in the near term our credit operational and other risks have generally increased and for the foreseeable future are expected to remain elevated or increase further the effect on economies and markets while the actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities initially slowed the rate of spread of covid19 and supported economic stability it is not clear whether the salutary effects will persist especially if resurgences worsen or increase national regional and local economies and markets could suffer further disruptions that are lasting during the six months ended june the most notable impact to our results of operations was higher provision expense for credit losses our provision expense was billion for the six months ended june compared to million during the same period in with the increase primarily driven by incremental reserves associated with a deterioration in macroeconomic variables such as unemployment during the six months ended june for more detail and further discussion refer to the section titled covid19 impacts within the mda given the unpredictability of covid19 and its direct and indirect effects however our forecast of macroeconomic conditions and operating resultsincluding expected lifetime credit losses on our loan portfoliois subject to meaningful uncertainty as governments acted to temporarily close or restrict the operations of businesses including automotive dealers and as many consumers and businesses changed their behavior in response we experienced significant reductions in our consumer automotive loan application volume during the second half of march and into april in addition we observed downward pressure on the automotive sales and other operating results of our dealer customers on their capacity to accept the return of leased vehicles and on usedvehicle auction activity and values as consumers and businesses began to adapt to the changed conditions and many governmental authorities relaxed their restrictions later in the second quarter however we observed a gradual recovery in activity including stronger usedvehicle prices even so many automotive manufacturers and their suppliers had taken measures to slow or shut down production in response to the pandemic which negatively affected dealer inventory levels and sales during the second quarter of and significantly reduced our wholesale floorplan lending business to dealers lower dealer inventory levels also reduced vehicle inventory insurance premiums within our insurance operations declining sales and limited operations at dealers during the second half of march and into april reduced demand in our insurance operations for consumer products such as vsc and gap protection but as in automotive finance we experienced a gradual recovery in these consumer products later in the second quarter for more detail and further discussion refer to the section titled significant business developments related to covid19 within the mda we cannot yet be confident however in the sustainability of these improvements in ally financial inc form 10q our businessespecially with the recent resurgence of covid19 in many parts of the united statesand the adverse effects on our business financial position results of operations and prospects could be significant as time goes on governments have taken unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their containment measures for example in late march the cares act was enacted to inject more than trillion of financial assistance into the us economy the frb has taken decisive and sweeping actions as well since march these actions have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses we also have acted swiftly to support our customers with industryleading programs and at the same time manage our credit risk for example in our automotive finance business existing customers had the option to elect to defer their loan and lease payments for up to days without late fees being incurred but for consumer automotive loans with finance charges continuing to accrue this program was made available to consumer automotive loan and lease customers from march through june approximately million consumer automotive loan and lease customers enrolled in the program and of the million consumer automotive loan customers enrolled in the program were granted a 120day deferral at the time of enrollment as of june approximately thousand or of our consumer automotive loan customers were enrolled in the program for dealers with current accounts we have offered for up to four months a waiver of curtailments on wholesale floorplan loans an increase in used vehicle floorplan advance rates a deferral of interest and insurance charges on wholesale borrowings and a deferral of term loan payments as of june approximately or of eligible dealers had requested at least one form of this assistance approximately of eligible wholesale dealers deferred wholesale interest and insurance payments during the second quarter of which represented a decline from the first quarter of approximately percentage points dealers that elected to defer wholesale interest and insurance payments have the option to repay such balances over a or 12month period without additional interest charges or fees for more detail and further discussion refer to the section titled credit quality indicators in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements and to the section titled risk managemen t within the mda the degree to which our actions and those of governments and others will directly or indirectly assist our customers counterparties and thirdparty service providers and advance our business and the economy generally is not yet clear for example while our loandeferral programs may better position customers to resume their regular payments to us in the future and enhance our brand and customer loyalty these programs may negatively impact our revenue and other results of operations at least in the near term and may not be as successful as we expect in managing our credit risk in addition while the frbs accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by supporting economic activity among our customers this policy and sudden shifts in it may inhibit our ability to grow or sustain net interest income and effectively manage interestrate and market risks further while extraordinary governmental intervention in the economy and markets has created stability the scale of these actions inevitably heightens political reputational litigation and similar risks for financial intermediaries like us furthermore while governmental stimulus and relief programs may have supported the financial condition of some of our customers in the early stages of the pandemic these programs may be discontinued or curbed before the economy recovers may otherwise be insufficient and may create political fiscal monetary and other adverse consequences for households and businesses we are unable to estimate the nearterm and ultimate impacts of covid19 on our business and operations at this time the pandemic and its direct and indirect effects could cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio additional increases in our allowance for credit losses impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets heightened volatility in and diminished access to capital markets and other funding sources further reduced demand for our products and services and other negative impacts on our financial position results of operations and prospects in addition while we continue to anticipate that our capital and liquidity positions will be sufficient sustained adverse effects may impair these positions prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements and result in downgrades in our credit ratings the covid19 pandemic and related governmental mandates and advisories also have necessitated changes in the way we and our thirdparty service providers continue operations and we may face heightened security informationtechnology operational and similar risks as a result the length of time we and our thirdparty service providers may be required to operate under these circumstances as well as the potential for conditions to worsen or for significant disruptions to occur remains unpredictable all of these risks and uncertainties can be expected to persist at least until the pandemic is demonstrably and sustainably contained authorities cease curbing household and business activity and consumer and business confidence recover
