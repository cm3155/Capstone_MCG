liquidity or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in ally we describe certain of these risks and uncertainties in this section although we may be adversely affected by other risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us that we have failed to appreciate or that we currently consider immaterial these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the mda in part ii item of this report and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto this annual report on s or declines in the strength of national or local economies could decrease demand for our products and services increase the amount and rate of delinquencies and losses raise our operating and other expenses and negatively impact the returns on and the value of our loans investment portfolio and other assets further if a ally financial inc form 10k significant and sustained increase in fuel prices or other adverse conditions were to lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases or prices our automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer considerably in addition concerns about the pace of economic growth and uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies can result in significant volatility in the financial markets and could impact our ability to obtain costeffective funding if any of these events were to occur or worsen our business results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected acts or threats of terrorism natural disasters and other conditions or events beyond our control could adversely affect us geopolitical conditions natural disasters pandemics and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or prospects refer to the risk factor above titled the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers and the adverse impacts on our business financial position results of operations and prospects could be significant for more information on risks associated with the covid19 pandemic for example acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken in response to terrorism could adversely affect general economic business or market conditions and in turn us especially as an intermediary within the financial system we also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel a significant number of our employees or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic natural disaster war act of terrorism accident or similar cause these same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well as their own thirdparty service providers and counterparties significant repurchases or indemnification payments in our securitizations could harm our profitability and financial condition we have repurchase and indemnification obligations in our securitizations if we were to breach a representation warranty or covenant in connection with a securitization we may be required to repurchase the affected loans or otherwise compensate investors or purchasers for losses caused by the breach if the scale or frequency of repurchases or indemnification payments were to increase substantially from its present levels our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in such a circumstance we also could suffer reputational damage become subject to stricter supervisory scrutiny and private litigation and find our access to capital and banking markets more limited or more costly our business and operations make extensive use of models and we could be adversely affected if our design implementation or use of models is flawed we use quantitative models to price products and services measure risk calculate the quantitative portfolio of our allowance for loan losses estimate asset and liability values assess capital and liquidity manage our balance sheet create financial forecasts and otherwise conduct our business and operations if the design implementation or use of any of these models is flawed we could make strategic or tactical decisions based on incorrect misleading or incomplete information in addition to the extent that any flawed models or inaccurate model outputs are used in reports to banking agencies or the public we could be subjected to supervisory actions private litigation and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and financial results refer to the section titled risk management in the mda that follows our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate foreign exchange and market risks which could adversely affect our financial results we employ various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate foreign exchange and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities our hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors if any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and other market factors we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition in addition we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties on acceptable terms or at all which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies we use estimates and assumptions in determining the value or amount of many of our assets and liabilities if our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect our cash flow profitability financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected we use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets including retained interests from securitizations loans held for sale and other investments that do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded we also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of our operating lease assets in addition we use estimates and assumptions in determining our allowance for loan losses reserves for legal matters insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred but not reported including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements refer to the section titled critical accounting estimates in the mda that follows our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons for example they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control such as macroeconomic conditions and their impact on automotive dealers and often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables factors and other assumptions assumptions and estimates are also far more difficult during periods of market dislocation or illiquidity as a result our actual experience may differ substantially from these estimates and assumptions a meaningful difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow profitability financial condition and prospects and may increase the volatility of our financial results in addition several different judgments associated with assumptions or estimates could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported ally financial inc form 10k significant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results market prices for securities and other financial assets are subject to considerable fluctuation fluctuations may result for example from perceived changes in the value of the asset the relative price of alternative investments shifts in investor sentiment geopolitical events actual or expected changes in monetary or fiscal policies and general market conditions due to these kinds of fluctuations the amount that we realize in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the last reported value and could negatively affect our financial results additionally negative fluctuations in the value of availableforsale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported revenues expenses profitability and financial condition our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap which are periodically revised or expanded the application of gaap is also subject to varying interpretations over time accordingly we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards such as the fasb the sec banking agencies and our independent registered public accounting firm those changes are beyond our control but could adversely affect our revenues expenses profitability or financial condition for example the adoption of cecl effective january has resulted in a significant increase to our allowance for loan losses refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for financial accounting standards issued by the fasb but not yet adopted by the company the financial system is highly interrelated and the failure of even a single financial institution could adversely affect us the financial system is highly interrelated including as a result of lending trading clearing counterparty and other relationships we have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with a wide variety of financial institutions including brokers dealers commercial banks and investment banks if any of these institutions were to become or perceived to be unstable were to fail in meeting its obligations in full and on time or were to enter bankruptcy conservatorship or receivership the consequences could ripple throughout the financial system and may adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or prospects because of interrelationships within the financial system this could occur even if the institution itself were not systemically important or perceived to play a meaningful role in the stable functioning of the financial markets adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in the states where we have loan or operating lease concentrations may negatively affect our business and financial results we are exposed to portfolio concentrations in some states including california texas and florida factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these states could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to successfully manage issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business or financial results the performance and value of our business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that we may suffer especially as an intermediary within the financial system this harm could arise from negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to adequately address issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally risks to our reputation could arise in any number of contextsfor example stricter regulatory or supervisory environments cyber incidents and other security breaches inabilities to meet customer expectations mergers and acquisitions lending or banking practices actual or perceived conflicts of interest failures to prevent money laundering inappropriate conduct by employees and inadequate corporate governance our failure to maintain appropriate esg practices and disclosures could result in reputational harm a loss of customer and investor confidence and adverse business and financial results governments investors customers and the general public are increasingly focused on esg practices and disclosures for us and others in the financialservices industry this focus extends to the practices and disclosures of the customers counterparties and service providers with whom we choose to do business for example while we have a relatively smaller carbon footprint as a digital financial services company and do not have commerciallending relationships with a host of sensitive industries such as those whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to the environment or the public health the majority of our business and operations are connected to the automotive industry views about esg are diverse dynamic and rapidly changing and if we were to fail to maintain appropriate esg practices and disclosures we could suffer

at fair market value minus statutory capital or if no surplus exists out of our net profits for the thencurrent or immediately preceding fiscal year further even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and delaware law to pay dividends on our common stock we may not have sufficient cash or regulatory approvals to do so the market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted by antitakeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law that could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of ally or by other banking antitrust or corporate laws that have or are perceived as having an antitakeover effect our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging hindering or preventing an acquisition that our board of directors does not find to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders for example our organizational documents include provisions limiting the liability of our directors and providing indemnification to our directors and officers and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of
