item risk factors table end an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference herein the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors see also special note regarding forwardlooking statements and risk factors summary if any of the events described in the risk factors should actually occur our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if this were to happen the value of our securities could decline significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment risks related to the covid19 pandemic the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant deterioration and disruption in national and local economic conditions and record levels of unemployment which may have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations the covid19 pandemic has created extensive disruptions to the global economy to businesses and to the lives of individuals throughout the world federal and state governments have taken unprecedented actions to contain the spread of the disease including quarantines travel bans shelterinplace orders closures of businesses and schools fiscal stimulus and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief in many locations throughout the united states the spread of covid19 decreased substantially throughout the spring and summer of and as a result several of the activity restrictions listed above were lifted in whole or in part in many jurisdictions however due in large part to the increased spread of new more transmissible coronavirus variants the number of individuals diagnosed with covid19 has again increased substantially in recent months the substantial increase in covid19 infections has caused state and local governments to consider and in some cases implement various activity restrictions and containment measures that previously had been lifted the widespread availability of multiple covid19 vaccines and corresponding rates of vaccination generally have been effective in curtailing rates of infection in many parts of the united states and in turn mitigating many of the adverse social and economic effects of the pandemic however a significant portion of the population remains unvaccinated and the efficacy of the vaccines in preventing infection and serious illness is believed to wane over time and may be diminished in the face of new coronavirus variants accordingly the pandemic and related efforts to contain it continue to disrupt global economic activity and functioning of the financial markets impact interest rates and monetary policy decisions increase economic and market uncertainty and disrupt trade and supply chains there have been trillions of dollars in economic stimulus packages initiated by the federal reserve and the federal government including the trillion cares act as expanded by the ppp and health care enhancement act and more recently the economic aid act in an effort to counteract the significant economic disruption from the covid19 pandemic however there can be no assurance that these packages will continue to be effective in stimulating and sustaining economic activity and additional governmental stimulus and related interventions may be needed moreover as economic conditions relating to the pandemic have improved over time the federal reserve has shifted its focus to limiting the inflationary and other potentially adverse effects of the extensive pandemicrelated government stimulus which signals the potential for a continued period of economic uncertainty even if the pandemic subsides to help address the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the economy and financial markets the fomc reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of to the lowest since the economic crisis and the yields on and 30year treasury notes have declined to historic lows throughout the fomc elected to continue to follow this approach as pandemicrelated risks to the economy are likely to persist for the foreseeable future the reduction in interest rates especially if prolonged could adversely affect our net interest income net interest spread and net interest margin further the overall impact of the covid19 pandemic on the financial markets could result in a significant decline in the market value of the corporations common stock which may cause us to perform a goodwill impairment test in between annual tests if that impairment test indicates that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge which could adversely affect our results of operations the effects of the covid19 pandemic continue to vary significantly by region and the full extent of the effects of the pandemic on the us and global economies labor markets and financial markets are still being determined any future development will be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic the effectiveness of our remote working arrangements third party providers ability to support our operations and any further action taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic the uncertain future development of this crisis could materially and adversely affect our business operations operating results financial condition liquidity or capital levels regulatory and governmental actions to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic on borrowers could result in a material decline in our earnings in addition to the covid19 pandemics continued and ultimately cumulative impact on global economic activity there have been a number of regulatory governmental actions that also impact our operations and financial condition due to the unforeseen nature of the pandemic any future developments and resulting regulatory action is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted however to date there have been a number of bank regulatory actions and legislative changes intended to help mitigate the adverse economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on borrowers including temporary bans on evictions and foreclosures and mandates requiring financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers affected by the covid19 pandemic and mandatory loan forbearances on march the cares act was signed into law the cares act was a trillion economic stimulus bill that was intended to provide relief in the wake of the covid19 pandemic further on december the economic aid act was signed into law as part of the coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act of which among other things directed financial regulators to support community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions and directs congress to reappropriate billion in unobligated cares act funds beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into early the omicron variant of the coronavirus has spread substantially and rapidly throughout the united states and globally as a result social and economic activity has been disrupted in many parts of the country in response members of congress have begun to evaluate the prospects of approving additional stimulus payments principally for businesses that have been most impacted by the recent increase in covid19 infections however the prospects and timing for any additional covid19 relief measures are not clear at this time during the governors of many states in which we do business or in which our borrowers and loan collateral are located issued temporary bans on evictions and foreclosures which have now expired similar bans were implemented by fnma and fhlmc which have also expired to the extent similar bans are again implemented we would again expect to experience declines in borrower loan payments which may have a material impact on our earnings our loan portfolios have been significantly affected by the covid19 pandemic the economic disruption in response to the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in delinquencies and loans on nonaccrual status across all of our loan portfolios particularly our commercial loan portfolio as certain industries have been particularly hardhit by the covid19 pandemic which has adversely affected the ability of many of our borrowers to repay their loans as of december our commercial loan portfolio includes billion of outstanding loans to borrowers in key industries which may see elevated risk as a result of the current economic dynamics representing of total loans these key exposures include million of loans to retailers and shopping centers million of loans to borrowers in the hotel industry million to restaurantrelated borrowers and approximately million across various exposures which have been significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic the unemployment rate has improved in recent months however disruptions in the labor markets caused by or relating to the pandemic and associated fluctuations in rates of employment may have a significant adverse impact on the ability of our residential and multifamily borrowers to repay their loans credit risks changes in economic and political conditions could adversely affect our earnings as our borrowers ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans decline our success depends to a certain extent upon local national and global economic and political conditions as well as governmental monetary policies conditions such as an economic recession the impact of international trade negotiations on local and national economies rising unemployment changes in interest rates money supply and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our asset quality deposit levels and loan demand and therefore our earnings because we have a significant amount of real estate loans decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral the occ recently reported that although us economic activity was strong throughout much of banks remain in strong condition with sound capital and liquidity levels and financial market conditions are favorable us economic activity is expected to moderate in due to factors including elevated levels of inflation and corresponding upward pressure on interest rates high levels of commercial debt and uncertainty in both the commercial and residential real estate markets as the covid19 pandemic continues to disrupt economic activity significantly financial institutions face increased credit risk strategic risk operational risk and compliance risk adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans which could have an adverse impact on our earnings consequently declines in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations changes in us trade policies including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations there continues to be discussion and dialogue regarding potential changes to us trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs with countries such as china and those within the european union the prior administration imposed certain tariffs and retaliatory tariffs as well as other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export these restrictions may cause the prices of our customers products to increase which could reduce demand for such products or reduce our customers margins and adversely impact their revenues financial results and ability to service debt this in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future although the current administration has expressed interest in improving relations with key transatlantic partners including by relaxing certain tariffs imposed by the prior administration the trade policies of the current administration remain somewhat unsettled accordingly it remains unclear what the us government or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed additional tariffs that may be imposed or international trade agreements and policies our allowance for credit losses may be insufficient all borrowers have the potential to default and our remedies in the event of such default such as seizure andor sale of collateral legal actions and guarantees may not fully satisfy the debt owed to us we maintain an allowance for credit losses which is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense that represents managements best estimate of probable credit losses over the life of the loan within the existing portfolio of loans the allowance for credit losses in the judgment of management is necessary to reserve for estimated credit losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio the level of the allowance for credit losses reflects managements continuing evaluation of industry concentrations specific credit risks loan loss experience current loan portfolio quality present economic political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information all of which may undergo material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses in addition bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of additional loan charge offs based on judgments different than those of management an increase in the allowance for credit losses would result in a decrease in net income and possibly riskbased capital and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we are subject to lending concentration risks as of december approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial real estate construction cre loans assetbased lending and ppp loans collectively commercial loans commercial loans are generally viewed as having more inherent risk of default than residential mortgage loans or other consumer loans further the commercial loan balance per borrower is typically larger than that for residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans implying higher potential losses on an individual loan basis because our loan portfolio contains a number of commercial loans with balances over million the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonaccrual loans which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations cre lending may expose us to increased lending risks our policy generally has been to originate cre loans primarily in the eight states in which the bank operates at december cre loans including owner occupied investor and real estate construction loans totaled billion or of our total loan portfolio as a result of our growth in this portfolio over the past several years and planned future growth these loans require more ongoing evaluation and monitoring and we are implementing enhanced risk management policies procedures and controls cre loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy because payments on loans secured by cre often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrowers control such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation in recent years cre markets have been experiencing substantial growth and increased competitive pressures have contributed significantly to historically low capitalization rates and rising property values cre prices according to many us cre indices are currently above the peak levels that contributed to the financial crisis accordingly the federal bank regulatory agencies have expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current cre market and have applied increased regulatory scrutiny to institutions with cre loan portfolios that are fast growing or large relative to the institutions total capital our failure to adequately implement enhanced risk management policies procedures and controls could adversely affect our ability to increase this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in and increased losses from this portfolio at december nonaccrual cre loans totaled million or approximately of our total portfolio of cre loans we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information furnished by and on behalf of our customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties including financial statements credit reports and other financial information we may also rely on representations of those customers counterparties or other third parties such as independent auditors as to the accuracy and completeness of that information reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements credit reports or other financial information could cause us to enter into unfavorable transactions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations lack of system integrity or credit quality related to funds settlement could result in a financial loss we settle funds on behalf of financial institutions other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients card issuers payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types transactions we facilitate include wire transfers debit card credit card and electronic bill payment transactions supporting consumers financial institutions and other businesses these payment activities rely upon the technology infrastructure that facilitates the verification of activity with counterparties and the facilitation of the payment if the continuity of operations or integrity of processing were compromised this could result in a financial loss to us due to a failure in payment facilitation in addition we may issue credit to consumers financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement a default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property during the ordinary course of business we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans in doing so there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if hazardous or toxic substances are found we may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses which may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property in addition future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before lending against or initiating any foreclosure action on real property these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations liquidity and interest rate risks liquidity is essential to our businesses the corporation requires liquidity to meet its deposit and debt obligations as they come due access to liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or unforeseen outflows of deposits risk factors that could impair our ability to access capital markets include a downturn in our midwest markets difficult credit markets credit rating downgrades or regulatory actions against the corporation the corporations access to deposits can be impacted by the liquidity needs of our customers as a substantial portion of the corporations liabilities are demand while a substantial portion of the corporations assets are loans that cannot be sold in the same timeframe historically the corporation has been able to meet its cash flow needs as necessary if a sufficiently large number of depositors sought to withdraw their deposits for whatever reason the corporation may be unable to obtain the necessary funding at favorable terms we are subject to interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the federal reserve changes in monetary policy including changes in interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect i our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits ii the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and iii the average duration of our mortgage portfolio and other interestearning assets in response to the economic conditions resulting from the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic the federal reserves target federal funds rate has been reduced nearly to despite recent elevated levels of inflation and corresponding pressure to raise interest rates the federal reserve recently has indicated that it intends to continue this approach until such time that substantial further progress has been made towards achieving the federal reserves maximum employment objectives accordingly the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interestbearing liabilities which in turn could reduce our net interest margin spread and net income if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments our net interest income and therefore earnings could be adversely affected earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings the corporations interest rate risk profile is such that a higher or steeper yield curve adds to income while a flatter yield curve is relatively neutral and a lower or inverted yield curve such as experienced during the past year generally has a negative impact on earnings our most significant interest rate risk may be further declines in the absolute level of interest rates or the prolonged continuation of the current low rate environment as this would generally lead to further compression of our net interest margin reduced net interest income and devaluation of our deposit base although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies including the potential use of derivatives as hedging instruments to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations any substantial unexpected prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations also our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet the impact of interest rates on our mortgage banking business can have a significant impact on revenues changes in interest rates can impact our mortgagerelated revenues and net revenues associated with our mortgage activities a decline in mortgage rates generally increases the demand for mortgage loans as borrowers refinance but also generally leads to accelerated payoffs conversely in a constant or increasing rate environment we would expect fewer loans to be refinanced and a decline in payoffs although we use models to assess the impact of interest rates on mortgagerelated revenues the estimates of revenues produced by these models are dependent on estimates and assumptions of future loan demand prepayment speeds and other factors which may differ from actual subsequent experience changes in interest rates could reduce the value of our investment securities holdings the corporation maintains an investment portfolio consisting of various high quality liquid fixedincome securities the total book value of the securities portfolio which includes fhlb and federal reserve bank stocks as of december was billion and the estimated duration of the aggregate portfolio was approximately years the nature of fixedincome securities is such that changes in market interest rates impact the value of these assets based on the duration of the corporations investment securities portfolio a one percent decrease in market rates is projected to increase the market value of the investment securities portfolio by approximately million while a one percent increase in market rates is projected to decrease the market value of the investment securities portfolio by approximately million changes in interest rates could also reduce the value of our residential mortgagerelated securities and msrs which could negatively affect our earnings the corporation earns revenue from the fees it receives for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans when rates rise the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall reducing the revenue the corporation receives from loan originations at the same time revenue from msrs can increase through increases in fair value when rates fall mortgage originations tend to increase and the value of msrs tends to decline also with some offsetting revenue effect even though the origination of mortgage loans can act as a natural hedge the hedge is not perfect either in amount or timing for example the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of residential msrs is immediate but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the msrs relating to the new loans would accrue over time it is also possible that even if interest rates were to fall mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the msrs value caused by the lower rates the corporation typically uses derivatives and other instruments to hedge its mortgage banking interest rate risk the corporation generally does not hedge all of its risks and the fact that hedges are used does not mean they will be successful hedging is a complex process requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring the corporation could incur significant losses from its hedging activities there may be periods where the corporation elects not to use derivatives and other instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk see item financial statements and supplementary data note recent developments for details on the accounting policy change from locom to fair value accounting the replacement of the libor as a financial benchmark presents risks to the financial instruments originated or held by the corporation the libor is the reference rate used for many of our transactions including our lending and borrowing and our purchase and sale of securities as well as the derivatives that we use to manage risk related to such transactions however a reduced volume of interbank unsecured term borrowing coupled with recent legal and regulatory proceedings related to rate manipulation by certain financial institutions has led to international reconsideration of libor as a financial benchmark the fca which regulates the process for establishing libor announced in july that the sustainability of libor cannot be guaranteed accordingly although the fca confirmed the extension of overnight and and 12month libor through june in order to accord financial institutions greater time with which to manage the transition from libor the fca is no longer persuading or compelling banks to submit to libor the federal banking agencies including the occ previously determined that banks must cease entering into any new contract that uses libor as a reference rate by no later than december in addition banks have been encouraged to identify contracts that extend beyond june and implement plans to identify and address insufficient contingency provisions in those contracts the corporation has multiple alternative reference rates available to customers and there can be no assurances on which benchmark rates may become the primary replacement to libor for purposes of financial instruments that are currently referencing libor following the discontinuance of libor there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments and such discontinuation may increase operational and other risks to the corporation and the industry while there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor and the occ has opined that national banks may use any reference rate for its loans that a bank determines to be appropriate for its funding model and customer needs a group of large banks the arrc selected the sofr as an alternative to libor sofr has been published by the frbny since may and it is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities the frbny reports that sofr includes all trades in the broad general collateral rate plus bilateral us treasury repurchase agreement transactions cleared through the deliveryversuspayment service offered by the ficc a subsidiary of dtcc the frbny currently publishes sofr daily on its website at httpsappsnewyorkfedorgmarketsautoratessofr the frbny states on its publication page for sofr that use of sofr is subject to important disclaimers limitations and indemnification obligations including that the frbny may alter the methods of calculation publication schedule rate revision practices or availability of sofr at any time without notice because sofr is published by the frbny based on data received from other sources the bank has no control over its determination calculation or publication there can be no assurance that sofr will not be discontinued or fundamentally altered in a manner that is materially adverse to the parties that utilize sofr as the reference rate for transactions there is no assurance that sofr will be widely adopted as the replacement reference rate for libor or that the corporation will ultimately decide to adopt sofr as the reference rate for its lending or borrowing transactions the afx has also created the ameribor as another potential replacement for libor ameribor is calculated daily as the volumeweighted average interest rate of the overnight unsecured loans on afx because of the difference in how it is constructed ameribor may diverge significantly from libor in a range of situations and market conditions the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate including sofr or ameribor is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on the corporations business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on and the revenue and expenses associated with the corporations floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally adversely affect the value of the corporations floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates or other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the corporations preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased securities and require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from liborbased products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark in addition the implementation of libor reform proposals may result in increased compliance costs and operational costs including costs related to continued participation in libor and the transition to a replacement reference rate or rates we cannot reasonably estimate the expected cost we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue the parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its banking and other subsidiaries a substantial portion of the parent companys revenue comes from dividends from its subsidiaries these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the parent companys common and preferred stock and to pay interest and principal on the parent companys debt various federal andor applicable state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank and certain of our nonbanking subsidiaries may pay to us also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors in the event the bank subsidiary is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common and preferred stock the inability to receive dividends from the bank could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations operational risks we face significant operational risks due to the high volume and the high dollar value nature of transactions we process we operate in many different businesses in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process transactions operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations including but not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the corporation the execution of unauthorized transactions errors relating to transaction processing and technology breaches of our internal control systems or failures of those of our suppliers or counterparties compliance failures cyberattacks technology failures or unforeseen problems encountered while implementing new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems business continuation and disaster recovery issues and other external events insurance coverage may not be available for such losses or where available such losses may exceed insurance limits this risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards adverse business decisions or their implementation and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity the occurrence of any of these events could cause us to suffer financial loss face regulatory action and suffer damage to our reputation unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information whether through a cyberattack other breach of our computer systems or otherwise could severely harm our business in the normal course of our business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information on our behalf and on behalf of other third parties despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to cyberattacks security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses malware misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events information security risks for financial institutions like us continue to increase in part because of new technologies the increased use of the internet and telecommunications technologies including mobile devices and cloud computing to conduct financial and other business transactions political activism and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime perpetrators of fraud hackers terrorists and others in addition to cyberattacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information hackers have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions designed to disrupt key business services such as customerfacing web sites critical infrastructure sectors including financial services increasingly have been the targets of cyberattacks including attacks emanating from foreign countries such as the attack on the information technology company solarwinds which affected many fortune companies as well as us government agencies cyberattacks involving large financial institutions including denial of service attacks designed to disrupt external customerfacing services nation state cyberattacks and ransomware attacks designed to deny organizations access to key internal resources or systems as well as targeted social engineering and email attacks designed to allow unauthorized persons to obtain access to an institutions information systems and data or that of its customers are becoming more common and increasingly sophisticated further threat actors are increasingly seeking to target vulnerabilities in software systems used by large numbers of banking organizations in order to conduct malicious cyber activities these types of attacks have resulted in increased supply chain and thirdparty risk because the methods of cyberattacks change frequently or in some cases are not recognized until launch we are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all possible security breaches and the probability of a successful attack cannot be predicted although we employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents early detection may be thwarted by persistent sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection we also face risks related to cyberattacks and other security breaches in connection with card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third parties some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyberattacks and because the transactions involve third parties and environments that we do not control or secure future security breaches or cyberattacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them we also rely on numerous other third party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them while we conduct security assessments on our higher risk third party service providers we cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach cyber security risks for financial institutions also have evolved as a result of the use of new technologies devices and delivery channels to transmit data and conduct financial transactions the adoption of new products services and delivery channels contribute to a more complex operating environment which enhances operation risk and presents the potential for additional structural vulnerabilities in addition the ongoing and widespread remote work environment necessitated by the covid19 pandemic has subjected institutions to additional cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks the corporation regularly evaluates its systems and controls and implements upgrades as necessary the additional cost to the corporation of our cyber security monitoring and protection systems and controls includes the cost of hardware and software third party technology providers consulting and forensic testing firms insurance premium costs and legal fees in addition to the incremental cost of our personnel who focus a substantial portion of their responsibilities on cyber security any successful cyberattack or other security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information or that compromises our ability to function could severely damage our reputation erode confidence in the security of our systems products and services expose us to the risk of litigation and liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business any successful cyberattack may also subject the corporation to regulatory investigations litigation or enforcement or require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties or undertaking costly remediation efforts with respect to third parties affected by a cyber security incident all or any of which could adversely affect the corporations business financial condition or results of operations and damage its reputation from time to time the corporation engages in acquisitions including acquisitions of depository institutions the integration of core systems and processes for such transactions often occur after the closing which may create elevated risk of cyber incidents the corporation may be subject to the data risks and cyber security vulnerabilities of the acquired company until the corporation has sufficient time to fully integrate the acquirees customers and operations although the corporation conducts comprehensive due diligence of cybersecurity policies procedures and controls of our acquisition counterparties and the corporation maintains adequate policies procedures controls and information security protocols to facilitate a successful integration there can be no assurance that such measures controls and protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach with respect to the companies we acquire particularly during the period of time between closing and final integration our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business any failure interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management general ledger deposit loan and other systems while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure interruption or security breach of our information systems we cannot completely ensure that any such failures interruptions or security breaches will not occur or if they do occur that they will be adequately addressed the occurrence of any failures interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we are dependent upon third parties for certain information system data management and processing services and to provide key components of our business infrastructure we outsource certain information system and data management and processing functions to third party providers including among others fiserv inc and its affiliates to compete in a rapidly evolving financial marketplace these third party service providers are sources of operational and informational security risk to us including risks associated with operational errors information system interruptions or breaches and unauthorized disclosures of sensitive or confidential client or customer information concentration among larger third party providers servicing large segments of the banking industry can also potentially affect wide segments of the financial industry if third party service providers encounter any of these issues or if we have difficulty communicating with them we could be exposed to disruption of operations loss of service or connectivity to customers reputational damage and litigation risk that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or our business third party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections network access and core application processing while we have selected these third party vendors in accordance with supervisory requirements we do not control their actions any problems caused by these third parties including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense the potential for business interruption exists throughout our organization integral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our technical systems operational infrastructure relationships with third parties and the vast array of associates and key executives in our daytoday and ongoing operations failure by any or all of these resources subjects us to risks that may vary in size scale and scope this includes but is not limited to operational or technical failures ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as well as the loss of key individuals or failure on the part of key individuals to perform properly although management has established policies and procedures to address such failures the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations changes in the federal state or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance we are subject to changes in tax law that could increase our effective tax rates these law changes may be retroactive to previous periods and as a result could negatively affect our current and future financial performance for example legislation enacted in resulted in a reduction in our federal corporate tax rate from in to in which had a favorable impact on our earnings and capital generation abilities however this legislation also enacted limitations on certain deductions such as the deduction of fdic deposit insurance premiums which partially offset the anticipated increase in net earnings from the lower tax rate during congress debated various proposals for increase in the corporate tax rate and possible surcharges on corporate share repurchases as part of the funding for various spending initiatives any such increase in the corporate tax rate or surcharges would adversely affect our results of operations in future periods in addition the banks customers experienced and likely will continue to experience varying effects from both the individual and business tax provisions of the tax act and other future changes in tax law and such effects whether positive or negative may have a corresponding impact on our business and the economy as a whole impairment of investment securities goodwill other intangible assets or dtas could require charges to earnings which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations in assessing whether the impairment of investment securities is related to a deterioration in credit factors management considers the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and the intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term under current accounting standards goodwill is not amortized but instead is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount a decline in our stock price or occurrence of a triggering event following any of our quarterly earnings releases and prior to the filing of the periodic report for that period could under certain circumstances cause us to perform a goodwill impairment test and result in an impairment charge being recorded for that period which was not reflected in such earnings release during the annual impairment test conducted in may using a qualitative assessment indicated that the estimated fair value of all of the corporations reporting units exceeded the carrying value in the event that we conclude in a future assessment that all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired a noncash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital at december we had goodwill of billion which represents approximately of stockholders equity in assessing the realizability of dtas management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the dtas will not be realized assessing the need for or the sufficiency of a valuation allowance requires management to evaluate all available evidence both negative and positive including the recent trend of quarterly earnings positive evidence necessary to overcome the negative evidence includes whether future taxable income in sufficient amounts and character within the carryback and carryforward periods is available under the tax law including the use of tax planning strategies when negative evidence eg cumulative losses in recent years history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused exists more positive evidence than negative evidence will be necessary the impact of each of these impairment matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition revenues from our investment management and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings generating returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes is important to maintaining existing business and attracting new business administering or managing assets in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is also important to client satisfaction failure in either of the foregoing areas can expose us to liability and result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact our business the current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment as a result political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased in recent years governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions the us congress state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change such initiatives have been pursued with rigor under the current administration the financial stability oversight council of which the occ is a member published a report in october identifying climaterelated financial risk as an emerging threat to financial stability the leadership of the federal banking agencies including the comptroller of the currency have emphasized that climaterelated risks are faced by banking organizations of all types and sizes specifically including physical and transition risks and are in the process of enhancing supervisory expectations regarding banks risk management practices to that end in december the occ published proposed principles for climate risk management by larger banking organizations the occ also has appointed its first ever climate change risk officer and established an internal climate risk implementation committee in order to assist with these initiatives and to support the agencys efforts to enhance its supervision of climate change risk management the largest banks are being encouraged by their regulators to address the climaterelated risks that they face by accounting for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systematic risk assessments revising expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climaterelated factors evaluating the impact of climate change on the banks borrowers and consider possible changes to underwriting criteria to account for climaterelated risks to mortgaged properties incorporating climaterelated financial risk into the banks internal reporting monitoring and escalation process planning for transition risk posed by the adjustments to a lowcarbon economy and investing in climaterelated initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change further the federal reserve board has signaled that it is in the process of developing scenario analysis to model the possible financial risks associated with climate change when developed the resilience of large banking organizations as well as the broader financial system will be evaluated against these climate changerelated scenarios as part of the stress testing process although these requirements would not apply to a banking organization of our size as the corporation continues to grow and expand the scope of our operations our regulators generally will expect us to enhance our internal control programs and processes including with respect to stress testing under a variety of adverse scenarios and related capital planning to the extent that these initiatives lead to the promulgation of new regulations or supervisory guidance applicable to the corporation we would expect to experience increased compliance costs and other compliancerelated risks the above measures may also result in the imposition of taxes and fees the required purchase of emission credits and the implementation of significant operational changes each of which may require the corporation to expend significant capital and incur compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs given the lack of empirical data on the credit and other financial risks posed by climate change it is impossible to predict how climate change may impact our financial condition and operations however as a banking organization the physical effects of climate change may present certain unique risks to the corporation for example weather disasters shifts in local climates and other disruptions related to climate change may adversely affect the value of real properties securing our loans which could diminish the value of our loan portfolio such events may also cause reductions in regional and local economic activity that may have an adverse effect on our customers which could limit our ability to raise and invest capital in these areas and communities each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recognition of the risks posed by climate change as discussed above the corporation has taken a variety of actions to manage its carbon footprint and has sought to engage in sustainable lending and investment activities specifically including supporting renewable energy projects however we cannot guarantee the success of these actions nor can we make any assurances that our regulators investors in our securities or other third parties such as environmental advocacy organizations will find our efforts to support climaterelated initiatives to be sufficient severe weather natural disasters public health issues acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our ability to conduct business such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans adversely impact our employee base cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we are subject to esg risks that could adversely affect our reputation and the market price of our securities the corporation is subject to a variety of risks arising from esg matters esg matters include climate risk hiring practices the diversity of our work force and racial and social justice issues involving our personnel customers and third parties with whom we otherwise do business risks arising from esg matters may adversely affect among other things our reputation and the market price of our securities further we may be exposed to negative publicity based on the identity and activities of those to whom we lend and with which we otherwise do business and the publics view of the approach and performance of our customers and business partners with respect to esg matters any such negative publicity could arise from adverse news coverage in traditional media and could also spread through the use of social media platforms the corporations relationships and reputation with its existing and prospective customers and third parties with which we do business could be damaged if we were to become the subject of any such negative publicity this in turn could have an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and could have a negative impact on the market price for securities investors have begun to consider the steps taken and resources allocated by financial institutions and other commercial organizations to address esg matters when making investment and operational decisions certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies responses to the risks posed by climate change and other esg matters into their investment theses these shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the market price of our securities to the extent that investors determine that the corporation has not made sufficient progress on esg matters strategic and external risks our earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies the policies of the federal reserve impact us significantly the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interestbearing deposits and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold those policies determine to a significant extent our cost of funds for lending and investing changes in those policies are beyond our control and are difficult to predict federal reserve policies can also affect our borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans for example a tightening of the money supply by the federal reserve could reduce the demand for a borrowers products and services this could adversely affect the borrowers earnings and ability to repay its loan which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively our business strategy includes significant growth plans we intend to continue pursuing a profitable growth strategy our prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in significant growth stages of development sustainable growth requires that we manage our risks by balancing loan and deposit growth at acceptable levels of risk maintaining adequate liquidity and capital hiring and retaining qualified employees successfully managing the costs and implementation risks with respect to strategic projects and initiatives and integrating acquisition targets and managing the costs we cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business future prospects financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy also if we grow more slowly than anticipated our operating results could be materially adversely affected we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors both within and beyond our principal markets many of which are larger and may have more financial resources such competitors primarily include national regional and internet banks within the various markets in which we operate we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions including without limitation savings and loans credit unions finance companies brokerage firms insurance companies and other financial intermediaries the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes and continued consolidation in july the occ announced that it will begin accepting applications from financial technology companies to become special purpose national banks although the occs authority to issue special purpose bank charters to nonbank financial technology companies continues to be subject to ongoing litigation similar developments are likely to result in even greater competition within all areas of our operations in addition as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems in addition some of the largest technology firms are engaging in joint ventures with the largest banks to provide andor expand financial service offerings with a technological sophistication and breadth of marketing that smaller institutions do not have many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures additionally due to their size many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and as a result may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things the ability to develop maintain and build upon longterm customer relationships based on top quality service high ethical standards and safe sound assets the ability to expand our market position the scope relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors customer satisfaction with our level of service and industry and general economic trends failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position which could adversely affect our growth and profitability which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations fiscal challenges facing the us government could negatively impact financial markets which in turn could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations federal budget deficit concerns and the potential for political conflict over legislation to raise the us governments debt limit may increase the possibility of a default by the us government on its debt obligations related creditrating downgrades or an economic recession in the united states many of our investment securities are issued by the us government and government agencies and sponsored entities as a result of uncertain domestic political conditions including potential future federal government shutdowns the possibility of the federal government defaulting on its obligations for a period of time due to debt ceiling limitations or other unresolved political issues investments in financial instruments issued or guaranteed by the federal government pose liquidity risks in connection with prior political disputes over us fiscal and budgetary issues leading to the us government shutdown in sp lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the us from aaa to aa a further downgrade or a downgrade by other rating agencies as well as sovereign debt issues facing the governments of other countries could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the us and worldwide consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks for example consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts mutual funds or generalpurpose reloadable prepaid cards consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills andor transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks transactions utilizing digital assets including cryptocurrencies stablecoins and other similar assets have increased substantially certain characteristics of digital asset transactions such as the speed with which such transactions can be conducted the ability to transact without the involvement of regulated intermediaries the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions and the anonymous nature of the transactions are appealing to certain consumers notwithstanding the various risks posed by such transactions accordingly digital asset service providers which at present are not subject to the extensive regulation as banking organizations and other financial institutions have become active competitors for our customers banking business the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the states within which we do business our success depends on the general economic conditions of the specific local markets in which we operate particularly wisconsin illinois and minnesota local economic conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans on the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources a significant decline in general local economic conditions caused by inflation recession unemployment changes in securities markets changes in housing market prices or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the earnings of financial services companies are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions our operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad these conditions include shortterm and longterm interest rates inflation money supply political issues legislative and regulatory changes fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets broad trends in industry and finance the strength of the united states economy and uncertainty in financial markets globally all of which are beyond our control a deterioration in economic conditions including those arising from government shutdowns defaults anticipated defaults or rating agency downgrades of sovereign debt including debt of the us or increases in unemployment could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and npas decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services among other things any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk from time to time we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services we may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business andor a new product or service furthermore strategic planning remains important as we adopt innovative products services and processes in response to the evolving demands for financial services and the entrance of new competitors such as outofmarket banks and financial technology firms any new line of business andor new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls so we must responsibly innovate in a manner that is consistent with sound risk management and is aligned with the banks overall business strategies failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business andor new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition failure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services including the potential utilization of blockchain technology to provide alternative high speed payment systems the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations we may be adversely affected by risks associated with potential and completed acquisitions as part of our growth strategy we regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies as a result negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time we seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management economies of scale or expanded services acquiring other banks businesses or branches involves potential adverse impact to our financial results and various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions and with integrating acquired businesses resulting in the diversion of resources from the operation of our existing businesses difficulty in estimating the value of target companies or assets and in evaluating credit operations management and market risks associated with those companies or assets payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute our tangible book value and earnings per share in the short and long term potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company including without limitation liabilities for regulatory and compliance issues exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company there may be volatility in reported income as goodwill impairment losses could occur irregularly and in varying amounts difficulties inefficiencies or cost overruns associated with the integration of the operations personnel technologies services and products of acquired companies with ours inability to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence and or other projected benefits potential disruption to our business the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company acquisitions also involve operational risks and uncertainties and acquired companies may have unknown or contingent liabilities exposure to unexpected asset quality problems that require writedowns or writeoffs as well as restructuring and impairment or other charges difficulty retaining key employees and customers and other issues that could negatively affect our business we may not be able to realize any projected cost savings synergies or other benefits associated with any such acquisition we complete acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations could increase our operating costs significantly and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we face significant competition from other financial services institutions some of which may have greater financial resources than we do when considering acquisition opportunities accordingly attractive opportunities may not be available to us and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing future acquisitions acquisitions may be delayed impeded or prohibited due to regulatory issues acquisitions by the corporation particularly those of financial institutions are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies collectively regulatory approvals the process for obtaining these required regulatory approvals has become substantially more difficult in recent years regulatory approvals could be delayed impeded restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues the corporation has or may have with regulatory agencies including without limitation issues related to bsa compliance cra issues fair lending laws fair housing laws consumer protection laws unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations and other similar laws and regulations we may fail to pursue evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant acquisition opportunities as a result of our inability or perceived or anticipated inability to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner under reasonable conditions or at all the regulatory approvals may contain conditions on the completion of the merger that adversely affect our business following the closing or which are not anticipated or cannot be met difficulties associated with potential acquisitions that may result from these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations moreover in july president biden issued an executive order on promoting competition in the american economy which encouraged the federal banking agencies to review their current merger oversight practices the executive order has received significant public support from members of congress as well as a majority of the board members of the fdic in addition the director of the cfpb has publicly sought a greater role for the cfpb in the evaluation of proposed bank mergers any enhanced regulatory scrutiny of bank mergers and acquisitions and revision of the framework for merger application review may adversely affect the marketplace for such transactions could result in our acquisitions in future periods being delayed impeded or restricted in certain respects and result in new rules that possibly limit the size of financial institutions we may be able to acquire in the future and alter the terms for such transactions legal regulatory compliance and reputational risks we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision we are subject to extensive federal and applicable state regulation and supervision primarily through associated bank and certain nonbank subsidiaries banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole not shareholders these regulations affect our lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy and growth among other things congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes and proposed changes can be expected from the new administration changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject us to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products we may offer andor increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products among other things failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent these types of violations there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur significantly the enactment of the economic growth act and the promulgation of its implementing regulations repealed or modified several important provisions of the doddfrank act among other things the economic growth act and its implementing regulations raised the total asset thresholds to billion for doddfrank act annual companyrun stress testing leverage limits liquidity requirements and resolution planning requirements for bank holding companies subject to the ability of the federal reserve to apply such requirements to institutions with assets of billion or more to address financial stability risks or safety and soundness concerns accordingly the effect of banking legislation and regulations remains uncertain the implementation amendment or repeal of federal banking laws or regulations may affect the banking industry as a whole including our business and results of operations in ways that are difficult to predict in addition in september the cfpb and occ entered into a consent order with a large national bank alleging widespread improper sales practices which prompted the federal bank regulatory agencies to conduct a horizontal review of sales practices throughout the banking industry the elevated attention has resulted in continued additional regulatory scrutiny and regulation of incentive arrangements which could adversely impact the delivery of services and increase compliance costs the bank faces risks related to the adoption of future legislation and potential changes in federal regulatory agency leadership policies and priorities democrats assumed control of the us house of representatives and the us senate in albeit with a majority in the senate found only in the tiebreaking vote of vice president kamala harris with control of the white house and both chambers of congress democrats are now able to set the policy agenda both legislatively and in the regulatory agencies that have rulemaking and supervisory authority over the financial services industry generally and the bank specifically congressional committees with jurisdiction over the banking sector have pursued oversight and legislative initiatives in a variety of areas including addressing climaterelated risks promoting diversity and equality within the banking industry and addressing other esg matters improving competition in the banking sector and enhancing oversight of bank mergers and acquisitions establishing a regulatory framework for digital assets and markets and oversight of the covid19 pandemic response and economic recovery the prospects for the enactment of major banking reform legislation under the new congress are unclear at this time moreover the turnover of the presidential administration resulted in certain changes in the leadership and senior staffs of the federal banking agencies the cfpb cftc sec and the treasury department with certain significant leadership positions yet to be filled including the comptroller of the currency the chair of the fdic and three vacancies among the governors of the federal reserve board including the vice chair for supervision these changes have impacted the rulemaking supervision examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies and likely will continue to do so over the next several years the potential impact of any changes in agency personnel policies and priorities on the financial services sector including the bank cannot be predicted at this time changes in requirements relating to the standard of conduct for brokerdealers under applicable federal and state law may adversely affect our business the secs regulation best interest which was implemented in established a new standard of conduct for a brokerdealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities to such customer the regulation required us to review and modify our compliance activities including our policies procedures and controls which caused us to incur additional costs in addition state laws that impose a fiduciary duty also may require monitoring as well as require that we undertake additional compliance measures in addition the banks insurance agency subsidiary is also subject to regulation and supervision in the various states in which it operates the implementation and administration by the sec of regulation best interest as well as any new state laws that impose a fiduciary duty may negatively impact our results of operation as well as increase costs associated with legal compliance operations and information technology the cfpb has reshaped the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the prohibitions against unfair deceptive and abusive business practices compliance with any such change may impact the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the bank the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the doddfrank act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers as an independent bureau within the federal reserve system the cfpb may impose requirements more severe than the previous bank regulatory agencies the cfpb has also been directed to write rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service or the offering of a consumer financial product or service the cfpb has initiated enforcement actions against a variety of bank and nonbank market participants with respect to a number of consumer financial products and services that has resulted in those participants expending significant time money and resources to adjust to the initiatives being pursued by the cfpb the cfpb has pursued a more aggressive enforcement policy with respect to a range of regulatory compliance matters under the current administration cfpb enforcement actions may serve as precedent for how the cfpb interprets and enforces consumer protection laws including practices or acts that are deemed to be unfair deceptive or abusive with respect to all supervised institutions which may result in the imposition of higher standards of compliance with such laws moreover the bank is subject to supervision and examination by the cfpb for compliance with the cfpbs regulations and policies the costs and limitations related to this additional regulatory reporting regimen have yet to be fully determined although they may be material and the limitations and restrictions that will be placed upon the bank with respect to its consumer product offerings and services may produce significant material effects on the banks and the corporations profitability the bank is periodically examined for mortgagerelated issues including mortgage loan and default services fair lending and mortgage banking federal and state banking regulators closely examine the mortgage and mortgage servicing activities of depository financial institutions should any of these regulators have serious concerns with respect to our mortgage or mortgage servicing activities in this regard the regulators response to such concerns could result in material adverse effects on our growth strategy and profitability further staff changes to key positions within the cfpb under the current administration have resulted in the cfpb pursuing more strict enforcement policies specifically in the area of fair lending loan servicing collections and other consumer related areas we may experience unanticipated losses as a result of residential mortgage loan repurchase or reimbursement obligations under agreements with secondary market purchasers we may be required to repurchase residential mortgage loans or to reimburse the purchaser for losses with respect to residential mortgage loans which have been sold to secondary market purchasers in the event there are breaches of certain representations and warranties contained within the sales agreements such as representations and warranties related to credit information loan documentation collateral and insurability consequently we are exposed to credit risk and potentially funding risk associated with sold loans as a result we have established reserves in our consolidated financial statements for potential losses related to the residential mortgage loans we have sold the adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred will depend on among other things the actual future mortgage loan performance the actual level of future repurchase and reimbursement requests the actual success rate of claimants actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions due to uncertainties relating to these factors there can be no assurance that the reserves we establish will be adequate or that the total amount of losses incurred will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations fee revenues from overdraft protection programs constitute a significant portion of our noninterest income and may be subject to increased supervisory scrutiny revenues derived from transaction fees associated with overdraft protection programs offered to our customers represent a significant portion of our noninterest income in the corporation collected approximately million in overdraft transaction fees in recent months certain members of congress and the leadership of the occ and cfpb have expressed a heightened interest in bank overdraft protection programs in december the cfpb published a report providing data on banks overdraft and nonsufficient funds fee revenues as well as observations regarding consumer protection issues relating to participation in such programs the cfpb has indicated that it intends to pursue enforcement actions against banking organizations and their executives that oversee overdraft practices that are deemed to be unlawful in addition the comptroller of the currency has identified potential options for reform of national bank overdraft protection practices including providing a grace period before the imposition of a fee refraining from charging multiple fees in a single day and eliminating fees altogether in response to this increased congressional and regulatory scrutiny and in anticipation of enhanced supervision and enforcement of overdraft protection practices in the future certain banking organizations have begun to modify their overdraft protection programs including by discontinuing the imposition of overdraft transaction fees these competitive pressures from our peers as well as any adoption by our regulators of new rules or supervisory guidance or more aggressive examination and enforcement policies in respect of banks overdraft protection practices could cause us to modify our program and practices in ways that may have a negative impact on our revenue and earnings which in turn could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition as supervisory expectations and industry practices regarding overdraft protection programs change our continued offering of overdraft protection may result in negative public opinion and increased reputation risk we are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities we are subject to federal and applicable state income tax regulations income tax regulations are often complex and require interpretation changes in income tax regulations could negatively impact our results of operations in the normal course of business we are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and applicable state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged recently federal and state taxing authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions these tax positions may relate to tax compliance sales and use franchise gross receipts payroll property and income tax issues including tax base apportionment and tax credit planning the challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions if any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities whether customer claims and legal action related to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we are a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation we may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation arising out of our business our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and any claims asserted against us regardless of merit or eventual outcome may harm our reputation should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed our insurance coverage they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation for any period in addition we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms if at all the economic growth act did not eliminate many of the aspects of the doddfrank act that have increased our compliance costs and remains subject to further rulemaking the economic growth act which was enacted in represents modest reform to the regulation of the financial services industry primarily through certain amendments of the doddfrank act however many provisions of the doddfrank act that have increased our compliance costs such as the volcker rule the durbin amendment restricting interchange fees and the additional supervisory authority of the cfpb remain in place certain of the provisions amended by the economic growth act took effect immediately while others are subject to ongoing joint agency rulemakings it is not possible to predict when any final rules would ultimately be issued through any such rulemakings and what the specific content of such rules will be although we expect to benefit from many aspects of this legislative reform the legislation and any implementing rules that are ultimately issued could have adverse implications on the financial industry the competitive environment and our ability to conduct business in addition the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process which may offset the impact of the economic growth acts changes regarding stress testing and risk management negative publicity could damage our reputation reputation risk or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative public opinion is inherent in our business negative public opinion could adversely affect our ability to keep and attract customers and expose us to adverse legal and regulatory consequences negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including lending or foreclosure practices corporate governance regulatory compliance mergers and acquisitions and disclosure sharing or inadequate protection of customer information and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct because we conduct most of our business under the associated bank brand negative public opinion about one business could affect our other businesses ethics or conflict of interest issues could damage our reputation we have established a code of business conduct and ethics and related party transaction policies and procedures to address the ethical conduct of business and to avoid potential conflicts of interest any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our related controls and procedures or failure to comply

recommendations by securities analysts general market fluctuations industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events such as economic slowdowns or recessions interest rate changes or credit loss trends could also cause our securities prices to decrease regardless of our operating results there may be future sales or other dilution of our equity which may adversely affect the market price of our securities we are not restricted from issuing additional securities including preferred stock common stock and securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive common stock the issuance of additional shares of common stock or the issuance of convertible securities would dilute the ownership interest of our existing common shareholders the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of an equity offering as well as other sales of a large block of shares of our common stock or similar securities in the market after an equity offering or the perception that such sales could occur both we and our regulators perform a variety of analyses of our assets including the preparation of stress case scenarios and as a result of those assessments we could determine or our regulators could require us to raise additional capital we may reduce or eliminate dividends on our common stock although we have historically paid a quarterly cash dividend to the holders of our common stock holders of our common stock are not entitled to receive dividends downturns in the domestic and global economies could cause our board of directors to consider among other things the elimination of dividends paid on our common stock this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock furthermore as a bank holding company our ability to pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the federal reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends dividends also may be limited as a result of safety and soundness considerations common stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and preferred stock and effectively subordinated to all the indebtedness and other noncommon equity claims against our subsidiaries shares of the common stock are equity interests in us and do not constitute indebtedness as such shares of the common stock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and to other nonequity claims against us and our assets available to satisfy claims against us including our liquidation additionally holders of our common stock are subject to prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our outstanding preferred stock our board of directors is authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of the holders of our common stock and we are permitted to incur additional debt upon liquidation lenders and holders of our debt securities and preferred stock would receive distributions of our available assets prior to holders of our common stock furthermore our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon any of our subsidiaries liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiarys creditors including holders of any preferred stock of that subsidiary our articles of incorporation bylaws and certain banking laws may have an antitakeover effect provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and federal banking laws including regulatory approval requirements could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders the combination of these provisions may prohibit a nonnegotiated merger or other business combination which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock an investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit our common stock is not a bank deposit and therefore is not insured against loss by the fdic any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity an investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company as a result if you acquire our common stock you may lose some or all of your investment an entity holding as little as a interest in our outstanding common stock could under certain circumstances be subject to regulation as a bank holding company an entity including a group composed of natural persons owning or controlling with the power to vote or more of our outstanding common stock or or more if such holder otherwise exercises a controlling influence over us may be subject to regulation as a bank holding company in accordance with the bhc act in addition any bank holding company or foreign bank with a us presence may be required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve under the bhc act to acquire or retain or more of our outstanding common stock and any person not otherwise defined as a company by the bhc act and its implementing regulations may be required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve under the change in bank control act to acquire or retain or more of our outstanding common stock becoming a bank holding company imposes certain statutory and regulatory restrictions and obligations such as providing managerial and financial strength for its bank subsidiaries regulation as a bank holding company could require the holder to divest all or a portion of the holders investment in our common stock or such nonbanking investments that may be deemed impermissible or incompatible with bank holding company status such as a material investment in a company unrelated to banking further on january the federal reserve finalized a rule that simplifies and increases the transparency of its rules for determining when one company controls another company for purposes of the bhc act the rule became effective september the rule has and will likely continue to have a meaningful impact on control determinations related to investments in banks and bank holding companies and investments by bank holding companies in nonbank companies our ability to originate residential mortgage loans for portfolio has been adversely affected by the increased competition resulting from the unprecedented involvement of the us government and gses in the residential mortgage market over the past several years we have faced increased competition for residential mortgage loans due to the unprecedented involvement of the gses in the mortgage market as a result of the economic crisis which has caused the interest rate for year fixedrate mortgage loans that conform to gse guidelines to remain artificially low in addition the us congress has expanded the conforming loan limits in many of our operating markets allowing larger balance loans to continue to be acquired by the gses however the president of the united states and proposed key cabinet nominees have indicated that reforming the gse system is a priority item on the administrations regulatory agenda it is unknown at this time what reforms if any will be made the extent of the future involvement in the residential mortgage market and the impact of any reforms on that market and the united states economy as a whole general risk factors changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial results and condition some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions if such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect we may experience material losses from time to time the fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements these changes are beyond our control can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations and financial condition we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements in material amounts our internal controls may be ineffective management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the controls are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain skilled people competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire sufficiently skilled people or to retain them the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel loss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers our business is primarily relationshipdriven in that many of our key employees have extensive customer relationships loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor or otherwise choose to transition to another financial services provider while we believe our relationship with our key personnel is good we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with our organization loss of such key personnel could result in the loss of some of our customers table start
