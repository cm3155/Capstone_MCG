item risk factors the following risk factors supplements the risk factors described in the corporations annual report on form 10k and should be read in conjunction therewith the coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic has resulted in significant deterioration and disruption in national and local economic conditions and record levels of unemployment which may have a material impact on our business financial condition or results of operations the outbreak of covid19 has caused a global and national health emergency resulting in the president declaring a national emergency and for the first time in history the issuance of a major disaster declaration for all states federal and state governments have taken and continue to take unprecedented actions to slow the spread of the disease including stayathome orders travel restrictions and quarantines and shutdowns of schools and businesses the vast majority of states are currently operating under stayathome orders including the states in which the corporation does business wisconsins stayathome order has been extended until may and illinois and minnesotas stayathome orders have been extended until may and may respectively while all three states have also announced some easing of restrictions on nonessential businesses and in illinois an expansion of the types of businesses considered essential public health experts have cautioned that reopening the economy too soon could result in a resurgence of covid19 the uncertain economic conditions and stayat home orders due to covid19 have resulted in an extremely challenging operating environment for many businesses and the complete shutdown of others as well as record levels of unemployment the national unemployment rate increased to in april from in january the national unemployment level has increased with unprecedented speed as more than million people have filed for unemployment assistance in the wake of the economic shutdown due to covid19 the timing for any reopening of the economy is unclear and could be delayed longer than as indicated by recent public statements from the white house in addition the governors of wisconsin minnesota illinois indiana kentucky michigan and ohio have agreed to coordinate their states economic reopenings and while there have been trillions of dollars in economic stimulus packages initiated by the federal reserve and the federal government including the trillion cares act as expanded by the paycheck protection program and health care act in an effort to counteract the significant economic disruption from covid19 there can be no assurance that these packages will be sufficient or work quickly enough to stimulate the economy and additional governmental stimulus may be needed accordingly the corporation will be operating under uncertain economic conditions for a lengthy period of time additionally the covid19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and has resulted in a number of federal reserve actions market interest rates have declined significantly in march the federal reserve reduced the target federal funds rate to a range of to the lowest since the economic crisis and announced a billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the covid19 pandemic in addition the federal reserve reduced the interest that it pays on excess reserves at its april meeting the federal reserve continued its commitment to these policies these reductions in interest rates especially if prolonged could adversely affect our net interest income net interest spread and net interest margin further the overall impact of covid19 on the financial markets could result in a significant decline in the market value of the corporations common stock which may cause us to perform a goodwill impairment test in between annual tests if that impairment test indicates that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge which could adversely affect our results of operations the full impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business activities as a result of new government and regulatory policies programs and guidelines as well as market reactions to such activities remains uncertain regulatory and governmental actions to mitigate the impact of covid19 on borrowers including required loan forbearances and restrictions on evictions could result in a material decline in our earnings there have been a number of recent bank regulatory actions and legislative changes intended to help mitigate the adverse economic impact of covid19 on borrowers including mandates requiring financial institutions to work constructively with borrowers affected by covid19 in addition the governors of many states in which we do business or in which our borrowers and loan collateral are located have issued temporary bans on evictions and foreclosures in wisconsin the governor has issued a temporary ban on all residential and commercial evictions and foreclosures until may in addition we have implemented the following programs to assist our borrowers and other customers in mitigating the impact of covid19 consumer and commercial loan and credit card deferral programs suspension of certain transaction and late fees and the suspension of foreclosures and repossessions at the federal level section of the cares act allows until the earlier of december or the date the national emergency declared by the president terminates borrowers with federallybacked onetofour family mortgage loans experiencing a financial hardship due to covid19 to request forbearance regardless of delinquency status for up to days section also prohibits servicers of federallybacked mortgage loans from initiating foreclosures during the 60day period beginning march in addition under section of the cares act until the earlier of december and the date the national emergency declared by the president terminates borrowers with federallybacked multifamily mortgage loans whose payments were current as of february but who have since experienced financial hardship due to covid19 may request a forbearance for up to days borrowers receiving such forbearance may not evict or charge late fees to tenants for its duration as a result of the forbearance and mitigation programs described above we expect a significant decline in borrower loan payments which may have a material impact on our earnings as well as a reduction in fee income we expect our loan portfolios to be significantly affected by the response to covid19 and our allowance for credit losses on loans may not be sufficient to cover losses in our portfolios the economic shutdown in response to covid19 may result in a significant increase in delinquencies across all of our loan portfolios particularly our commercial loan portfolio as stayathome orders and travel restrictions have caused many businesses to close either temporarily or permanently or substantially reduce operations which will adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans in particular our commercial loan portfolio includes billion representing of total loans to borrowers in key industries which may see elevated risk as a result of the current economic dynamics these key exposures include billion of loans to retailers and shopping centers million to oil gas producers million of loans to borrowers in the hotel industry million to restaurant related borrowers and approximately million across various exposures which have been significantly impacted by the stayathome orders and travel restrictions the substantial increase in unemployment will also have a significant adverse impact on the ability of our residential and multifamily borrowers to repay their loans as a result of our evaluation of the current and expected impacts of covid19 on our loan portfolios we believe that our loan losses and delinquencies will significantly exceed what we anticipated when our acll was established at the end of as a result we have increased our acll by million to million for the first quarter of compared to million at the end of as the economic impact due to covid19 has been experienced in recent weeks and there are no assurances as to how long it will be before the covid19 pandemic abates and economic activity can begin to resume to precovid19 pandemic levels there is no assurance that we will not need to significantly add to our loan loss reserves in future periods the stayathome orders in the states in which we do business have created operational challenges for our business and our ability to conduct our business could be further adversely affected if a significant number of our management or employees or their families become ill due to covid19 under the stayathome orders in place in the states in which we conduct business all individuals generally must stay at home except to perform certain essential activities or governmental functions or to operate essential businesses while banks are considered essential and our branches and offices are permitted to remain open we have taken a number of actions to help ensure the safety of our employees and customers including suspending all lobby access at most of our branch locations and conducting branch business through our drive thru windows and atms and requiring employees with certain job functions to work from home we also have contingency plans in place to ensure continuity of management and operations in the event that members of our senior management or employees become ill due to covid19 however notwithstanding the protective measures and plans we have in place our employees and their families may still be affected by covid19 if a significant number of our employees or if key individuals become unable to work or to perform their jobs properly due to covid19 our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted in addition we rely on third party vendors to provide key components of our business infrastructure if any of these third party vendors experience significant disruption as a result of covid19 they may not be able to provide their services properly or in a timely manner which could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business we also face an increased risk of cyberattacks or other security breaches due to the increase in the number of our employees working from home as well as an increase in online banking activity we have originated a significant number of loans under the sbas paycheck protection program which may result in a large number of such loans remaining on our consolidated balance sheets at a very low yield for an extended period of time we participated as a lender under the sbas ppp established under the cares act the ppp authorizes financial institutions to make federallyguaranteed loans to qualifying small businesses and nonprofits organizations these loans carry a maturity of two years and an interest rate of per annum the ppp provides that such loans may be forgiven if the borrowers meet certain requirements with respect to maintaining employee headcount and payroll and the use of the loan proceeds after the loan is originated if not forgiven these loans will be guaranteed by the sba under the sbas section 7a program as of may we had originated billion of ppp loans in light of the speed at which the ppp was implemented particularly due to the first come first served nature of the program the loans originated under this program may present potential fraud risk increasing the risk that loan forgiveness may not be obtained by the borrowers and that the guaranty may not be honored in addition there is risk that the borrowers may not qualify for the loan forgiveness feature due to the conduct of the borrower after the loan is originated these factors may result in us having to hold a significant amount of these lowyield loans on our books for a significant period of time the occ has also recently issued guidance encouraging banks to follow prudent banking practices consistent with safety and soundness principles in making ppp loans including by thoroughly documenting the banks decisions when setting eligibility criteria establishing a process for considering applications and approving or denying ppp loan applications as well as identifying and tracking ppp loan volumes the guidance also states that in exercising supervisory and enforcement responsibilities in this area the occ will take into account the unique circumstances resulting from the national emergency and good faith efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements thus while the ppp guidelines provide that lenders may rely on borrower representations and certifications regarding eligibility with respect to ppp loans and do not need to verify information provided the occ guidance makes clear that banks are still expected to prudently underwrite document and track ppp loans in a manner consistent with safe and sound banking practices and could face supervisory or enforcement risks in failing to do so further recent statements by members of congress and the secretary of the treasury of the united states make clear that compliance with the ppp requirements likely will become the subject of investigations and potentially enforcement actions by various government agencies risks related to oil and gas industry we may be adversely affected by declines in oil prices ongoing volatility in the oil and gas markets has compressed margins for many usbased oil producers and others in the oil and gas industry our oil and gas portfolio is comprised of credits made to small and midsized companies these borrowers are likely to be adversely affected by price volatility or a downturn in oil and gas prices during the first quarter of there has been a drastic decrease in crude oil prices as a result of the reported dispute between russia and saudi arabia regarding oil production levels which could result in a material adverse impact on such borrowers as of march our oil and gas loan exposure was million of commitments with million outstanding representing less than of our loan portfolio the acll related to this portfolio was at march compared to at december a significant deterioration in our oil and gas loans could cause a significant increase in nonaccrual loans an increase in nonaccrual loans could result in a loss of interest income from these loans one or more additional increases in the provision for credit losses and an increase in loan charge offs all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations
