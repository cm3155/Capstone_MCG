real estate construction loans are primarily shortterm or interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial income properties multifamily projects or residential

project experience the credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas but is also influenced by general economic conditions the

standards for cre and real estate construction lending are determined by property type and specifically address many criteria including maximum loan amounts maximum ltv requirements for preleasing and or presales minimum borrower equity and maximum loantocost currently the maximum standard for ltv is with lower limits established for certain higher risk types such as raw land that has a ltv maximum the corporations ltv guidelines are in compliance with regulatory supervisory limits in most cases for real estate construction loans the loan amounts include interest reserves which are built into the loans and sized to fund loan payments through construction and lease up and or sell out residential mortgages residential mortgage loans are primarily first lien home mortgages with a maximum loantocollateral value without credit enhancement eg private mortgage insurance of the residential mortgage portfolio is focused primarily in the corporations threestate branch footprint with approximately of the outstanding loan balances in the corporations branch footprint at september the rates on adjustable rate mortgages adjust based upon the movement in the underlying index which is

residential real estate mortgage loans have been sold in the secondary market with servicing rights retained subject to managements analysis of the current interest rate environment among other market factors the corporation may choose to retain mortgage loan production on its balance sheet see section loans for additional information on loans the corporations underwriting and riskbased pricing guidelines for residential mortgage loans include minimum borrower fico score and maximum ltv of the property securing the loan residential mortgage products generally are underwritten using fhlmc and fnma secondary marketing guidelines home equity home equity consists of both home equity lines of credit and closedend home equity loans the corporations credit risk monitoring guidelines for home equity are based on an ongoing review of loan delinquency status as well as a quarterly review of fico score deterioration and property devaluation the corporation does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update ltv ratios after origination however the corporation monitors the local housing markets by reviewing the various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring process for junior lien home equity loans the corporation is unable to track the performance of the first lien loan if it does not own or service the first lien loan however the corporation obtains a refreshed fico score on a quarterly basis and monitors this as part of its assessment of the home equity portfolio the corporations underwriting and riskbased pricing guidelines for home equity lines of credit and loans consist of a combination of both borrower fico score and the original cumulative ltv against the property securing the loan currently the corporations policy sets the maximum acceptable ltv at the corporations current home equity line of credit offering is priced based on floating rate indices and generally allows years of interestonly payments followed by a 20year amortization of the outstanding balance the loans in the corporations portfolio generally have an original term of years with principal and interest payments required see section loans for additional information on loans indirect auto the corporation currently purchases retail auto sales contracts via a network of approved auto dealerships across states throughout the northeast midatlantic and midwestern united states the auto dealerships finance the sale of automobiles as the initial lender and then assign the contracts to the corporation pursuant to dealer agreements the corporations underwriting and pricing guidelines are based on a dual risk grade derived from a combination of fico auto score and proprietary internal custom score minimum grade and fico score standards ensure the credit risk is appropriately managed to the corporations risk appetite further the grade influences loanspecific parameters such as vehicle age term ltv loan amount mileage payment and debt service thresholds and pricing maximum loan terms offered are months on select grades with vehicle age mileage and other limitations in place to qualify the program is designed to capture primarily prime and super prime contracts over time the corporation expects roughly of originations to be secured by used vehicles other consumer other consumer consists of student loans shortterm personal installment loans and credit cards the corporation had million and million of student loans at september and december respectively the majority of which are government guaranteed currently there is federal student loan relief in effect through december credit risk for nongovernment guaranteed student loans shortterm personal installment loans and credit cards is influenced by general economic conditions the characteristics of individual borrowers and the nature of the loan collateral risks of loss are generally on smaller average balances per loan spread over many borrowers once charged off there is usually less opportunity for recovery of these smaller consumer loans credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers monitoring payment histories and taking appropriate collateral and guarantee positions the student loan portfolio is in runoff and no new student loans are being originated nonperforming assets management is committed to a proactive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy this philosophy is implemented through the ongoing monitoring and

to borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty see also note loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional restructured loans disclosures potential problem loans the level of potential problem loans is another predominant factor in determining the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in determining the appropriate level of the acll potential problem loans are generally defined by management to include loans rated as substandard by management that are collectively evaluated not nonaccrual loans or accruing tdrs however there are circumstances present to create doubt as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms the decision of management to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that the corporation expects losses to occur but that management recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans oreo management actively seeks to ensure oreo properties held are monitored to minimize the corporations risk of loss allowance for credit losses on loans credit risks within the loan portfolio are inherently different for each loan type credit risk is controlled

entitled credit risk see note loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on the acll to assess the appropriateness of the acll the corporation focuses on the

various classifications of loan segments changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries existing economic conditions and economic forecasts the fair value of underlying collateral funding assumptions on lines and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses the corporation utilized the moodys baseline forecast for august which was compared to the september forecast for material updates in the allowance model the forecast is applied over a year reasonable and supportable period with straightline reversion to historical losses over the second year of the period assessing these factors involves significant judgment because each of the criteria used is subject to change the acll is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future credit losses on loans in any particular segment therefore management considers the acll a critical accounting estimate see section critical

additional information regarding activity in the acll the loan segmentation used in calculating the acll at september and december was generally comparable the methodology to calculate the acll consists of the following components a valuation allowance estimate is established for commercial and consumer loans determined by the corporation to be individually evaluated using discounted cash flows estimated fair value of underlying collateral andor other data available loans are segmented for criticized loan pools by loan type as well as for noncriticized loan pools by loan type primarily based on risk rating rates after considering loan type historical loss and delinquency experience credit quality and industry classifications loans that have been criticized are considered to have a higher risk of default than noncriticized loans as circumstances were present to support the lower loan grade warranting higher loss factors additionally management allocates acll to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components due to qualitative factors evaluated by management such as limitations within the credit risk grading process known current economic or business

disclosures about market risk market risk and interest rate risk are managed centrally market risk is the potential for loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of fixedincome securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the corporation is exposed to both market risk and interest rate risk in addition to market risk interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods the corporation uses financial modeling simulation techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk policies established by the corporations alco and approved by the board of directors are intended to limit these risks the board has delegated daytoday responsibility for managing market and interest rate risk to alco the primary objectives of market risk management are to minimize any adverse effect that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets recorded at fair value interest rate risk the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the board of directors these limits and guidelines reflect the corporations risk appetite for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons no interest rate limit breaches occurred during the first nine months of the major sources of the corporations nontrading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities changes in the shape of the yield curve and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options we measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models which are employed by management to understand nii at risk interest rate sensitive ear and mve at risk the corporations interest rate risk profile is such that a higher or steeper yield curve adds to income while a flatter yield curve is relatively neutral and a lower or inverted yield curve generally has a negative impact on earnings the corporations ear profile is asset sensitive at september for further discussion of the corporations interest rate risk and corresponding key assumptions see the interest rate risk section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the corporations annual report on form 10k the sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in nii and ear due to gradual moves in benchmark interest rates from a baseline scenario over months we evaluate the sensitivity using a dynamic forecast incorporating expected growth in the balance sheet and a static forecast where the current balance sheet is held constant while a gradual shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under a probable scenario an instantaneous shift in interest rates would have a more significant impact table estimated change in rate sensitive earnings at risk over months sep dec dynamic forecast static forecast dynamic forecast static forecast gradual rate change bp increase in interest rates bp increase in interest rates at september the mve profile indicates a decrease in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous upward changes in rates table market value of equity sensitivity sep dec instantaneous rate change bp increase in interest rates bp increase in interest rates since mve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change in mve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie the current year further mve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships and changes in product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates the above nii ear and mve measures do not include all actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates in the financial stability oversight council and financial stability board raised concerns about the reliability and robustness of libor and called for the development of alternative interest rate benchmarks the arrc through authority from the federal reserve has selected sofr as the alternative rate and developed a paced transition plan which addresses the risk that libor may not exist beyond june as part of the corporations efforts to limit exposure to libor based loans performing borrowers can modify or refinance their residential mortgage loans to a fixed interest rate or an adjustable rate mortgage tied to the oneyear treasury adjusted to a constant maturity of one year with an appropriate margin this provides the bank and borrower with greater certainty around the loan structure the bank has not booked a libor adjustable rate mortgage since the first quarter of additionally the corporation has been monitoring its volume of commercial credits and derivatives tied to libor in the corporation began prioritizing sofr prime and ameribor as the preferred alternative reference rates and ceased booking libor based commitments after the end of loans with a maturity after june are being reviewed and monitored to ensure there is appropriate fallback language in place when libor is no longer published loans with a maturity date before that time should naturally mature and be reunderwritten with an appropriate alternative index

of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period actual results could differ significantly from those estimates estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the acll and msrs valuation a discussion of these estimates can be found in the critical accounting estimates section in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the corporations annual report on form 10k there has been one change in the corporations application of critical accounting estimates since december driven by the irrevocable election to account for msrs under the fair value measurement methodology mortgage servicing rights valuation we have a significant investment in msrs our msrs are primarily retained from sales in the secondary market of residential mortgage loans we have originated or purchased from correspondent lenders msrs are initially recognized and subsequently carried at fair value changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur through mortgage banking net on the consolidated statements of income msrs are not traded in active markets the fair value of msrs is determined by discounting the projected cash flows certain significant assumptions and estimates used in valuing msrs are based on current market sources including projected prepayment speeds assumed servicing costs ancillary income costs to service delinquent loans costs of foreclosure and discount rates with optionadjusted spreads assumptions used to value our msrs are considered significant unobservable inputs and represent our best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to value this asset a separate third party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates housing turnover rates estimated loan curtailment anticipated defaults and other relevant factors the prepayment model is updated periodically for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of our servicing portfolio the optionadjusted spread is added to the discount rate across all interest rate paths generated in a stochastic process which will properly capture the embedded options for msrs cash flows the assumptions used in this model are primarily based on mortgage interest rates evaluation of the effect of a change in one assumption without considering the effect of that change on other assumptions is not meaningful considering all related assumptions we expect a basis point increase in the yield curve to increase the fair value of our servicing rights by million and decrease the value of the hedge by million likewise we expect a basis point decrease in the yield curve to decrease the fair value of our servicing rights by million and increase the value of our hedge by million recent developments on october the corporations board of directors declared a regular
