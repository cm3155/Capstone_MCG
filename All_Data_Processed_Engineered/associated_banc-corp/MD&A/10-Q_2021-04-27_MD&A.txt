multifamily projects or residential development both single family and condominium real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are generally well known to the corporation and have prior successful project experience the credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas but is also influenced by

estate construction lending are determined by property type and specifically address many criteria including maximum loan amounts maximum ltv requirements for preleasing and or presales minimum borrower equity and maximum loantocost currently the maximum standard for ltv is with lower limits established for certain higher risk types such as raw land that has a ltv maximum the corporations ltv guidelines are in compliance with regulatory supervisory limits in most cases for real estate construction loans the loan amounts include interest reserves which are built into the loans and sized to fund loan payments through construction and lease up and or sell out residential mortgages residential mortgage loans are primarily first lien home mortgages with a maximum loantocollateral value without credit enhancement eg private mortgage insurance of the residential mortgage portfolio is focused primarily in the corporations threestate branch footprint with approximately of the outstanding loan balances in the corporations branch footprint at march the majority of the on balance sheet residential mortgage portfolio consists of libor or constant maturity treasury based hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial fixed rate terms of or years the rates on these mortgages adjust based upon the movement in the underlying index which is then added to a margin and rounded to the nearest that result is then subjected to any periodic caps to produce the borrowers interest rate for the coming term in the financial stability oversight council and financial stability board raised concerns about the reliability and robustness of libor and called for the development of alternative interest rate benchmarks the arrc through authority from the federal reserve have selected the sofr as the alternative rate and developed a paced transition plan which addresses the risk that libor may not exist beyond the end of there are still many components of this plan which have not been fully decided or implemented in the industry as a result the corporation is reaching out to certain borrowers offering an opportunity to refinance or modify their loans to avoid any uncertainty around the libor transition performing borrowers can modify or refinance to a fixed interest rate or an adjustable rate mortgage tied to the oneyear treasury adjusted to a constant maturity of oneyear with an appropriate margin this provides the bank and borrower with greater certainty around the loan structure the corporation generally retains certain fixedrate residential real estate mortgages in

on loans the corporations underwriting and riskbased pricing guidelines for residential mortgage loans include minimum borrower fico and maximum ltv of the property securing the loan residential mortgage products generally are underwritten using fhlmc and fnma secondary marketing guidelines home equity home equity consists of both home equity lines of credit and closedend home equity loans the corporations credit risk monitoring guidelines for home equity is based on an ongoing review of loan delinquency status as well as a quarterly review of fico score deterioration and property devaluation the corporation does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update ltv ratios after origination however the corporation monitors the local housing markets by reviewing the various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring process for junior lien home equity loans the corporation is unable to track the performance of the first lien loan if it does not own or service the first lien loan however the corporation obtains a refreshed fico score on a quarterly basis and monitors this as part of its assessment of the home equity portfolio the corporations underwriting and riskbased pricing guidelines for home equity lines of credit and loans consist of a combination of both borrower fico and the original cumulative ltv against the property securing the loan during the second quarter of in the volatile economic environment the corporation reduced its exposure by reducing its maximum ltv on home equity lines of credit from to among other changes while maintaining the minimum acceptable fico at the corporations current home equity line of credit offering is priced based on floating rate indices and generally allows years of interestonly payments followed by a 20year amortization of the outstanding balance during the third quarter of based upon an analysis of market conditions and uncertainty around the timing and scope of the anticipated economic recovery the corporation temporarily suspended new applications for home equity lines of credit due to improving economic conditions

january president biden extended the federal student loan relief through september credit risk for nongovernment guaranteed student loans shortterm personal installment loans and credit cards is influenced by general economic conditions the characteristics of individual borrowers and the nature of the loan collateral risks of loss are generally on smaller average balances per loan spread over many borrowers once charged off there is usually less opportunity for recovery of these smaller consumer loans credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers monitoring payment histories and taking appropriate collateral and guarantee positions the student loan portfolio is in runoff and no new student loans are being originated covid19 update beginning on

difficulty see also note loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional restructured loans disclosures potential problem loans the level of potential problem loans is another predominant factor in determining the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in determining the appropriate level of the acll potential problem loans are generally defined by management to include loans rated as substandard by management that are collectively evaluated not nonaccrual loans or accruing tdrs however there are circumstances present to create doubt as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms the decision of management to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that the corporation expects losses to occur but that management recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans oreo management actively seeks to ensure oreo properties held are monitored to minimize the corporations risk of loss

disclosures table provides information on loan growth and period end loan composition table provides additional information regarding npas and table and table provide additional information regarding activity in the acll the loan segmentation used in calculating the acll at march and december was generally comparable the methodology to calculate the acll consists of the following components a valuation allowance estimate is established for commercial and consumer loans determined by the corporation to be individually evaluated using discounted cash flows estimated fair value of underlying collateral andor other data available loans are segmented for criticized loan pools by loan type as well as for noncriticized loan pools by loan type primarily based on historical loss rates after considering loan type historical loss and delinquency experience credit quality and industry classifications loans that have been criticized are considered to have a higher risk of default than noncriticized loans as circumstances were present to support the lower loan grade warranting higher loss factors the loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically reevaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks additionally management allocates acll to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components due to qualitative factors evaluated by management such as limitations within the credit risk grading process known current economic or business conditions that may not yet show in trends industry or other concentrations with

the fair value of fixed income securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the corporation is exposed to both market risk and interest rate risk in addition to market risk interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods the corporation uses financial modeling simulation techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk policies established by the corporations alco and approved by the board of directors are intended to limit these risks the board has delegated daytoday responsibility for managing market and interest rate risk to alco the primary objectives of market risk management are to minimize any adverse effect that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets recorded at fair value interest rate risk the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the board of directors these limits and guidelines reflect the corporations risk appetite for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons no interest rate limit breaches occurred during the first three months of the major sources of the corporations nontrading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities changes in the shape of the yield curve and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options we measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models which are employed by management to understand nii at risk interest rate sensitive ear and mve at risk the corporations interest rate risk profile is such that a higher or steeper yield curve adds to income while a flatter yield curve is relatively neutral and a lower or inverted yield curve generally has a negative impact on earnings the corporations ear profile is asset sensitive at march for further discussion of the corporations interest rate risk and corresponding key assumptions see the interest rate risk section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in the corporations annual report on form 10k the sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in nii and ear due to gradual moves in benchmark interest rates from a baseline scenario over months we evaluate the sensitivity using a dynamic forecast incorporating expected growth in the balance sheet and a static forecast where the current balance sheet is held constant while a gradual shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under a probable scenario an instantaneous shift in interest rates would have a much more significant impact table estimated change in rate sensitive earnings at risk over months dynamic forecast march static forecast march dynamic forecast december static forecast december gradual rate change bp increase in interest rates bp increase in interest rates at march the mve profile indicates an increase in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous upward changes in rates table market value of equity sensitivity march december instantaneous rate change bp increase in interest rates bp increase in interest rates since mve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change in mve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie the current year further mve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships and changes in product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates the above nii ear and mve measures do not include all actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in
