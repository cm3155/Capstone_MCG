the difference between interest income on interestearning assets such as loans and investment securities and the interest expense on interestbearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interestearning and other assets or activities net interest income is affected by the amount and composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities as well as the sensitivity of the balance

the use of interest rate derivative financial instruments interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities that fund those assets the net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to

lending primarily to borrowers in local markets and businesses periodically evaluating the underlying collateral and formally reviewing the borrowers financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis real estate construction real estate construction loans are primarily shortterm or interim loans that provide financing for the acquisition or development of commercial income properties multifamily projects or residential development both single family and condominium real estate construction loans are made to developers and project managers who are generally well known to the corporation and have prior successful project experience the credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas but is also influenced by general economic conditions the corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to established developers reviewing the merits of individual projects controlling loan structure and monitoring project progress and construction advances the corporations current lending standards for commercial real estate and real estate construction lending are determined by property type and specifically address many criteria including maximum loan amounts maximum ltv requirements for preleasing and or presales minimum borrower equity and maximum loantocost currently the maximum standard for ltv is with lower limits established for certain higher risk types such as raw land that has a ltv maximum the corporations ltv guidelines are in compliance with regulatory supervisory limits in most cases for real estate construction loans the loan amounts include interest reserves which are built into the loans and sized to fund loan payments through construction and lease up and or sell out residential mortgages residential mortgage loans are primarily first lien home mortgages with a maximum loantocollateral value without credit enhancement eg private mortgage insurance of the residential mortgage portfolio is focused primarily in the corporations threestate branch footprint with approximately of the outstanding loan balances in the

riskbased pricing guidelines for residential mortgage loans include minimum borrower fico score and maximum ltv of the property securing the loan residential mortgage products generally are underwritten using fhlmc and fnma secondary marketing guidelines home equity home equity consists of both home equity lines of credit and closedend home equity loans the corporations credit risk monitoring guidelines for home equity is based on an ongoing review of loan delinquency status as well as a quarterly review of fico score deterioration and property devaluation the corporation does not routinely obtain appraisals on performing loans to update ltv ratios after origination however the corporation monitors the local housing markets by reviewing the various home price indices and incorporates the impact of the changing market conditions in its ongoing credit monitoring process for junior lien home equity loans the corporation is unable to track the performance of the first lien loan if it does not own or service the first lien loan however the corporation obtains a refreshed fico score on a quarterly basis and monitors this as part of its assessment of the home equity portfolio the corporations underwriting and riskbased pricing guidelines for home equity lines and loans consist of a combination of both borrower fico score and the original cumulative ltv against the property securing the loan currently the corporations policy sets the maximum acceptable ltv at and the minimum acceptable fico score at the corporations current home equity line of credit offering is priced based on floating rate indices and generally allows years of interestonly payments followed by a 20year amortization of the outstanding balance the corporation has significantly curtailed its offerings of fixedrate closedend home equity loans the loans in the corporations portfolio generally have an original term of years with principal and interest payments required during

had million and million of student loans at december and december respectively the majority of which are government guaranteed credit risk for nongovernment guaranteed student shortterm personal installment loans and credit cards is influenced by general economic conditions the characteristics of individual borrowers and the nature of the loan collateral risks of loss are generally on smaller average balances per loan spread over many borrowers once charged off there is usually less opportunity for recovery of these smaller consumer loans credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers monitoring payment histories and taking appropriate collateral and guarantee positions the student loan portfolio is in runoff and no new student loans are being originated nonperforming assets management is committed to a proactive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy this philosophy is implemented through the ongoing monitoring and review of

predominant factor in determining the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses potential problem loans are generally defined by management to include loans rated as substandard by management but that are not considered impaired ie nonaccrual loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings however there are circumstances present to create doubt as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms the decision of management to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that the corporation expects losses to occur but that management recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans oreo management actively seeks to ensure oreo

controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards a thorough review of potential borrowers and ongoing review of loan payment performance active asset quality administration including early problem loan identification and the timely resolution of problems aids in the management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses credit risk management for each loan type is discussed in the section entitled credit risk see note loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on the allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is comprised of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments the level of the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of an amount appropriate to provide for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date the allowance for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets the corporations allowance for loan losses methodology considers an estimate of the historical loss emergence period which is the period of time between the event that triggers a loss and the confirmation and or charge off of that loss probability of default and loss given default for each loan portfolio segment the methodology applied by the corporation designed to assess the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is based upon credit report refreshes and managements ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio into criticized loan categories defined as specific loans warranting either specific allocation or a criticized status of special mention substandard doubtful or loss the methodology also focuses on the evaluation of many factors including but not limited to evaluation of facts and issues related to specific loans managements ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio credit report refreshes consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience on each portfolio category trends in past due and nonaccrual loans the level of potential problem loans the risk characteristics of the various classifications of loan segments changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries existing economic conditions the fair value of underlying collateral and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses assessing these factors involves significant judgment because each of the criteria used is subject to change the allowance for loan losses is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular segment therefore management considers the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting policy see section critical accounting policies see section nonperforming assets for a detailed discussion on asset quality see also managements allowance for loan losses accounting policy in note summary of significant accounting policies and see note loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional allowance for loan losses disclosures table provides information on loan growth and composition tables and provide additional information regarding activity in the allowance for loan losses and table provides additional information regarding nonperforming assets the methodology used for the determination of the allowance for loan losses at december and was generally comparable the allocation methodology consists of the following components first a valuation allowance estimate is established for specifically identified commercial and consumer loans determined by the corporation to be impaired using discounted cash flows estimated fair value of underlying collateral and or other data available second management allocates the allowance for loan losses with loss factors by loan segment loans are segmented for criticized loan pools by loan type as well as for noncriticized loan pools by loan type primarily based on historical loss rates after considering loan type historical loss and delinquency experience credit quality and industry classifications loans that have been criticized are considered to have a higher risk of default than noncriticized loans as circumstances were present to support the lower loan grade warranting higher loss factors the loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically reevaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels or other risks additionally management allocates allowance for loan losses to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components due to qualitative factors evaluated by management such as limitations within the credit risk grading process known current economic or business conditions that may not yet show in trends industry or other concentrations with current issues that impose higher inherent risks than are reflected in the loss factors and other

changes in the fair value of fixedincome securities equity securities other earning assets and derivative financial instruments as a result of changes in interest rates or other factors interest rate risk is the potential for reduced net interest income resulting from adverse changes in the level of interest rates as a financial institution that engages in transactions involving an array of financial products the corporation is exposed to both market risk and interest rate risk in addition to market risk interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods the corporation uses financial modeling simulation techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk policies established by the corporations alco and approved by the board of directors are intended to limit these risks the board has delegated daytoday responsibility for managing market and interest rate risk to alco the primary objectives of market risk management is to minimize any adverse effect that changes in market risk factors may have on net interest income and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets recorded at fair value interest rate risk the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within policy limits approved by the board of directors these limits and guidelines reflect the corporations risk appetite for interest rate risk over both shortterm and longterm horizons no interest rate limit breaches occurred during the major sources of the corporations nontrading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities changes in the shape of the yield curve and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options we measure these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through the use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models which are employed by management to understand nii at risk interest rate sensitive ear and mve at risk the corporations interest rate risk profile is such that a higher or steeper yield curve adds to income while a flatter yield curve is relatively neutral and a lower or inverted yield curve generally has a negative impact on earnings the corporations ear profile is slightly asset sensitive at december mve and ear are complementary interest rate risk metrics and should be viewed together net interest income and ear sensitivity capture asset and liability repricing mismatches for the first year inclusive of forecast balance sheet changes and are considered shorter term measures while mve sensitivity captures mismatches within the period end balance sheets through the financial instruments respective maturities and is considered a longer term measure a positive nii and ear sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that over the forecast horizon of one year asset based income will increase more quickly than liability based expense due to the balance sheet composition a negative mve sensitivity in a rising rate environment indicates that the value of financial assets will decrease more than the value of financial liabilities one of the primary methods that we use to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis which we use to model nii and rate sensitive noninterest items from the corporations balance sheet and derivative positions under various interest rate scenarios as the future path of interest rates is not known with certainty we use simulation analysis to project rate sensitive income under many scenarios including implied forward and deliberately extreme and perhaps unlikely scenarios the analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates rate shocks basis risk analysis and yield curve twists specific balance sheet management strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on nii and ear key assumptions in the simulation analysis and in the valuation analysis discussed below relate to the behavior of interest rates and pricing spreads the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit clients in different rate environments this analysis incorporates several assumptions the most material of which relate to the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate or noncontractual maturities and prepayment of loans and securities the sensitivity analysis included below is measured as a percentage change in nii and ear due to gradual moves in benchmark interest rates from a baseline scenario over months we evaluate the sensitivity using a dynamic forecast incorporating expected growth in the balance sheet and a static forecast where the current balance sheet is held constant while a gradual shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under a probable scenario an instantaneous shift in interest rates would have a much more significant impact table estimated change in rate sensitive ear over months table start dynamic forecast december static forecast december dynamic forecast december static forecast december gradual rate change bp increase in interest rates bp increase in interest rates table end we also perform valuation analysis which we use for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the nii simulation analysis whereas nii and ear simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions the valuation of the balance sheet at a point in time is defined as the discounted present value of all asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted present value of all liability cash flows the net of which is referred to as mve the sensitivity of mve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longerterm repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet unlike the nii simulation mve uses instantaneous changes in rates additionally mve values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the nii and ear simulations as with nii and ear simulations assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the mve analysis particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios at december the mve profile indicates a decline in net balance sheet value due to instantaneous upward changes in rates mve sensitivity is reported in both upward and downward rate shocks table market value of equity sensitivity table start december december instantaneous rate change bp increase in interest rates bp increase in interest rates table end the decrease in mve sensitivity from december was primarily attributable to the lower rate environment since mve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change in mve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie the current year further mve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships and changes in product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates the above nii ear and mve measures do not include all actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates contractual obligations commitments

statements management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period actual results could differ significantly from those estimates estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the allowance for loan losses goodwill impairment assessment msrs valuation and income taxes the consolidated financial statements of the corporation are prepared in conformity with us gaap and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates this preparation requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements accordingly as this information changes actual results could differ from the estimates assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported management believes the following policies are both important to the portrayal of the corporations financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments and therefore management considers the following to be critical accounting policies the critical accounting policies are discussed directly with the audit committee of the corporations board of directors allowance for loan losses managements evaluation process used to determine the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is subject to the use of estimates assumptions and judgments the evaluation process combines many factors managements ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio consideration of historical loan loss and delinquency experience trends in past due and nonaccrual loans risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries existing economic conditions the fair value of underlying collateral and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses because current economic conditions can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses and therefore the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses could change significantly as an integral part of their examination process various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses such agencies may require additions to the allowance for loan losses or may require that certain loan balances be charged off or downgraded into criticized loan categories when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination the corporation believes the level of the allowance for loan losses is appropriate see note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as the allowance for credit losses section goodwill impairment assessment goodwill is not amortized but instead is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the corporation conducted its most recent annual impairment test in may utilizing a qualitative assessment see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the corporations accounting policy on goodwill and see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the factors considered by management in the qualitative assessment based on this assessment management concluded that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value including goodwill for each reporting unit therefore a step one quantitative analysis was not required there were no events since the may impairment testing that have changed the corporations impairment assessment conclusion there was no impairment charges recorded in or mortgage servicing rights valuation the fair value of the corporations msrs asset is important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements since the msrs are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value msrs do not trade in an active open market with readily observable prices as such like other participants in the mortgage banking business the corporation relies on an independent valuation from a third party which uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its msrs the use of a discounted cash flow model involves judgment particularly of estimated prepayment speeds of underlying mortgages serviced and the overall level of interest rates loan type and note interest rate are the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans used to stratify capitalized msrs for purposes of measuring impairment the corporation periodically reviews the assumptions underlying the valuation of msrs while the corporation believes that the values produced by the discounted cash flow model are indicative of the fair value of its msrs portfolio these values can change significantly depending upon key factors such as the then current interest rate environment estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgages serviced and other economic conditions the proceeds that might be received should the corporation actually consider a sale of some or all of the msrs portfolio could differ from the amounts reported at any point in time to better understand the sensitivity of the impact of prepayment speeds and refinance rates on the value of the msrs asset at december holding all other factors unchanged if refinance rates were to decrease bp the estimated value of the msrs asset would have been approximately million or lower conversely if refinance rates were to increase bp the estimated value of the msrs asset would have been approximately million or higher however the corporations potential recovery recognition due to valuation improvement is limited to the balance of the msrs valuation reserve which was approximately at december the potential recovery recognition is constrained as the corporation has elected to use the amortization method of accounting rather than fair value measurement accounting under the amortization method msrs are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount net of accumulated amortization or estimated fair value therefore the msrs asset may only be marked up to the extent of the previously recognized valuation reserve the corporation believes the msrs asset is properly recorded on the consolidated balance sheets see note summary of significant accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements income taxes the assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates assumptions interpretations and judgment concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes and regulations there can be no assurance that future events such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities will not differ from managements current assessment the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings quarterly assessments are performed to determine if valuation allowances are necessary against any portion of the corporations dtas assessing the need for or sufficiency of a valuation allowance requires management to evaluate all available evidence both positive and negative including the recent trend of quarterly earnings positive evidence necessary to overcome the negative evidence includes whether future taxable income in sufficient amounts and character within the carryback and carryforward periods is available under the tax law including the use of tax planning strategies when negative evidence eg cumulative losses in recent years history of operating loss or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused exists more positive evidence than negative evidence will be necessary the corporation has concluded that based on the level of positive evidence it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized net of the existing valuation allowances at december and however there is no guarantee that the tax benefits associated with the dtas will be fully realized the corporation believes the tax assets and liabilities are properly recorded on the consolidated balance sheets see note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section income taxes table start
