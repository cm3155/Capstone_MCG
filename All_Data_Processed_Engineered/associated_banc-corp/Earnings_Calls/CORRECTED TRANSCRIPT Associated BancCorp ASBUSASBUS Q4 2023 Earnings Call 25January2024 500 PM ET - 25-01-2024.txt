our fourth quarter earnings call im andy harmening and im joined here once again by derek meyer our chief financial officer and pat ahern our chief credit officer id like to start by sharing some highlights for the fourth quarter and then as a whole from there dereks going to send an update on margin income statement and capital trends and then pat will provide an update on credit quality now its safe to say that was an extraordinary year for regional banks from rapid interest rate hikes to credit concerns to all our bank failures the industry is forced to grapple with new challenges that created uncertainty in the first half of the year here at associated we werent immune to the volatility that impacted the regional banking group as a whole but we weathered the storm through decisive actions that bolstered our liquidity and communication that was transparent with our customers importantly we also remained forwardlooking this enabled us to pivot quickly and maintain momentum with our strategic plan over the course of the year we reached several important milestones on our phase initiatives we reached nearly million in combined balances in our assetbased lending and equipment finance verticals we surpassed billion in outstandings in our primesuperprime auto book and expanded the business within our home footprint we launched a new brand campaign made several product enhancements and sharpened our digital sales capabilities driving a increase in consumer checking household acquisition and a decrease in attrition we continue to punch above our weight in digital launching major platform upgrades and achieving a three year high in consumer digital customer satisfaction scores we maintained strong momentum in mass affluent where we added over million in net new deposits since launch at the end of and all these efforts helped us grow our core customer base by over in the back half of with growth in both our consumer and our commercial segments to further build on this momentum we announced a multifaceted second phase of our strategic plan in november addressing expense control organic growth and balance sheet repositioning simultaneously the expense cuts and repositioning were completed in the fourth quarter multiple leadership positions have already been filled with top industry talent and rm hiring is ahead of schedule simply put we are on track now as we look at forward macro questions that remain with regards to the economy and credit and geopolitical landscape closer to home however were confident in our markets where unemployment rates in wisconsin minnesota and several other midwestern states remain below the national average of were confident in our associated bank team who have consistently proven that they can drive bestinclass service while continuing to bring new ideas to life and were confident in our plan that promotes growth and diversification to enhance our profitability without abandoning our foundational discipline on credit and expense management with all these factors coming together at once we are well positioned to deliver enhanced value to all stakeholders in and beyond with that id like to walk through some highlights from the fourth quarter as well as the full year starting on page slide on a gaap basis our fourth quarter results were impacted by onetime items tied to the balance sheet repositioning we announced back in november and the fdic special assessment that was finalized during associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 the quarter after excluding these onetime items momentum of our core business was reflected through adjusted earnings per share of during the quarter we continued to transform our balance sheet by executing on initiatives that helped us lower our funding costs and improve our liquidity position while improving earning asset yields on the funding side our focus remains squarely on growing core customer deposits after growing these core customer deposits by in  we add an additional growth in  with growth once again coming from both the consumer and commercial sides of the business all in all we grew core customer deposits by over million in the back half of the year as we continue to realize the impacts of our customer acquisition and relationshipdeepening initiatives we also added brokered cds during the quarter as a way to replace fhlb advances these actions and business results led to an overall decrease in our wholesale funding of within our loan portfolio our fourth quarter results were skewed by the million in mortgage loans we sold toward the end of the quarter but on an adjusted basis we were essentially flat for the quarter on the consumer side we continue to see steady growth in our primesuperprime auto book this was offset by a decrease in our commercial portfolios which was primarily driven by a decrease in mortgage warehouse balances while commercial loan balance growth slowed in the back half of the year we still saw loan balance growth by relative to on an adjusted basis moving to the income statement funding cost pressures have lingered in this dynamic rate environment but this pressure has continued to abate each quarter here in  our net interest income was essentially flat versus  and our nim decreased by just basis points due to the midquarter timing of our  balance sheet transaction we expect to see full benefit from our asset sales beginning in  of regards to noninterest income our gaap number is impacted by onetime items tied to our balance sheet repositioning during  but on an adjusted basis we saw another slight quarterly increase taken together despite the significant funding cost pressures the industry experienced in we were still able to grow our total adjusted revenue by for the year in were once again able to demonstrate an ability to control our expense run rate by identifying cost saves in underperforming areas and redirecting those funds into targeted investments that help us grow our customer base deepen relationships and enhance our profitability profile we did see a slight uptick in personnel expense late in the year but that was largely driven by the acceleration of our previously announced hiring plan through our initiatives as we execute on our growth strategy our conservative credit culture remains foundational and weve continued to monitor asset quality closely in  our nco ratio decreased basis points and our acll ratio increased by basis points we continue to see modest signs of a gradual normalization to precovid levels but have not yet seen indications of broader issues impacting specific industries or geographies now with several extraordinary items impacting our financials during the fourth quarter we provided a detailed breakdown of eps impacts from notable onetime items on slide these items can be summarized into two categories first the balance sheet repositioning we announced during the quarter impacted our income statement through a million net loss from the sale of mortgages and another million net loss on the security sale we completed combined these losses impacted our gaap eps by associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 secondly the fdic special assessment added million to our noninterest expense during the quarter which further impacted gaap eps by net of tax our eps came in at a positive for the quarter this adjusted number underscores the strength of our business gives us confidence that were on the right path with our strategic plan and importantly it sets us up for continued success in on slide we provide a bit more context for why were bullish heading into as weve discussed previously the first phase of our strategic plan announced back in was about laying the foundation through the addition of new loan verticals new relationshipfocused deposit gathering initiatives and the launch of an open architecture digital platform that enables us to control our own destiny through these efforts weve proven that we can execute as a company by driving diversified loan growth riding the ship of the multiyear pattern of household attrition and achieving threeyear highs in digital customer satisfaction the second phase of our strategy is designed to build on our momentum and position us for the future success of the company this plan was dynamic in that it enables us to address expenses enhance organic growth and accelerate balance sheet repositioning inorganically all at the same time we knew we need to start by managing expenses and we did by identifying and executing on million to million expense run rate reductions including a reduction in force around the branch closures and additional spending cuts these actions while difficult set us up to reinvest dollars into initiatives that will help us accelerate household growth deepen relationships remix our balance sheet and improve our profitability profile during the fourth quarter we also completed a sale of mortgage loans and securities designed to further accelerate the financial benefits of our organic initiatives by disposing of lowyielding assets and highcost funding we sold nearly billion of lowyielding mortgages and nearly million of securities enabling us to free up funding capacity and reinvest at higher rates now successful execution of any strategy hinges on having the right talent in the right places and weve made significant strides in bolstering our leadership team with top talent across the midwest who align with our culture and have a skill set to drive our plan forward as our plans picked up steam in the marketplace were seeing that the message is resonating not just for our customers or our existing colleagues but for the others in the industry who have started to view associated bank as an employer of choice its how weve been able to grow our rm base by since and its how weve been able to add talented leaders across key business segments in the past months attracting top talent is the first step towards execution and its clear were off to a strong start moving to slide the second wave of organic initiatives we announced back in november are on track in fact in some cases were ahead of schedule in the months since we made our announcement we made significant progress adding commercial and small business rms throughout our footprint weve also already launched several marketing product and digital initiatives designed to drive customer acquisition relationship deepening and retention we expect to continue to roll these enhancements out as a steady cadence throughout taken together between the success weve seen in phase of our initiatives and the progress weve already made in phase of our initiatives were well on our way down the path to building a higher return profile for our company thats what gives us confidence as we get into and beyond with that id like to highlight a few balance sheet trends for the fourth quarter beginning on slide as weve discussed previously the first half of was marked by industrywide volatility and an ongoing battle for associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 deposits these dynamics combined to drive significant funding cost pressures and forced banks to rethink their funding strategies while were not immune from this volatility at associated we saw meaningful stabilization of balance flows and cost pressures in  and that stabilization carried forward into  in this more stable environment the impacts of our relationshipfocused deposit gathering initiatives were seen much more clearly throughout the back half of the year after growing core customer deposits by in  we saw incremental core deposit growth of another in  in both quarters we saw net growth in both consumer and commercial loan balance commercial deposit balances demonstrated the broadbased impact of our deposit gathering efforts during the fourth quarter we also did flex into some brokered cds as a means to help pay down fhlb advances which decreased by billion during the quarter as a reminder our strategy is to fund our loan growth primarily with customer deposits we expect to hold wholesale network funding levels in check as we move through and we remain confident in our ability to fund our growth at a reasonable cost going forward based on our initiatives on slide we show an annual view of our deposit trends weve consistently grown our average annual deposits as our balance sheet has expanded over the years and was no different with that said our annual deposit numbers clearly demonstrate a mix shift from noninterestbearing products into higheryielding savings and cd accounts this dynamic reflects the impact of the rising rate environment and the period of volatility we saw in the first half of the year and as mentioned however the back half of the year told a different story while our core customer deposit shrank by during they grew by over in the back half of the year on slide youll see our deposit growth has come as a direct result of initiatives our deposit initiatives are designed to attract new customers deepen existing relationships and enhance retention throughout weve seen proof points confirming were on the right track across the bank as of the fourth quarter our consumer household acquisition rate was up versus the same period a year ago and our attrition was down for the full year our household levels were essentially flat but we consider this a key turning point for household growth as it comes on the heels of multiple years of shrinking total households digital has also been instrumental in our success and we continue to make regular enhancements to our offerings after a very busy recent launches include an upgraded digital platform for commercial customers and a tool that provides easier switching for new checking customers finally since launching our new mass affluent strategy weve added over million in net new deposits in this segment during more than doubling our full year goal this growth represents a roughly increase from our prelaunch baseline in the face of a very challenging environment in weve steadily continued to execute this plan with proven results in we expect to drive core customer deposit growth between and moving to slide we highlight our loan trends through the fourth quarter on a quarterly average basis loan balances grew by million but they decreased by million on an endofperiod basis a reflection of the million mortgage loan sale that settled towards the end of december on both an average and periodend basis  loan growth was led by our auto finance business where we continue to steadily add prime and super prime balances to our book associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 as a reminder we do not intend to become disproportionately reliant on auto loans but we view this portfolio as a means to diversify our customer book with highquality yieldfriendly loans without stretching on credit on the commercial side we saw growth from our utilities business offset by net outflows in other verticals including mortgage warehouse and general ci within the ci bucket the quarterly outflow was primarily driven by a subset of lowerquality credits strategically moved out of the bank at par across our broader portfolio we continue to seek selective growth that emphasizes relationships quality and diversification while delivering accretive returns this enables us to deemphasize loweryielding nonrelationship asset classes over time on slide we show loan trends on an annual basis average annual loans grew by billion in a trend that reflects the torrid pace of broadbased loan growth we saw in the back half of pointtopoint we grew total loans by over million during and that growth figure is inclusive of the million in mortgage balances that were pulled off our books in december excluding that sale we saw total loan growth of nearly billion or for the year consistent with the rest of the industry its clear that lending activity is slow going into the end of the year as our customers took a more cautious approach in the uncertain macro environment with that said weve continued to see encouraging signs of activity in our markets we also expect to benefit over time from the key leaders and rms weve already hired throughout our footprint as they get up and running taking into account the current lending environment and the anticipated impacts of our initiatives we expect to drive total loan growth of to in with that ill pass it to derek to walkthrough the income statement and capital trends derek derek s meyer chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy ill start with our asset and liability rate trends through the yearend on slide while fed funds rates stabilized in the back half of our total asset yields have continued to rise due to our remixing loan book and the repricing nature of a large segment of commercial loans since the fourth quarter of total earning assets have increased by basis points or roughly of the increase in fed funds target rate over the same period this trend has been led by rising yields in commercial cre and auto respectively on the liability side its no secret that rising rates liquidity pressures and a mix shift in customer deposits combined to create significant funding cost pressure for the industry in the first half of in the back half of the year however these trends stabilized meaningfully at associated in aggregate our interestbearing liability costs have now increased by basis points since the fourth quarter of or roughly of the move in fed funds target our interestbearing deposit beta has now climbed to roughly since the start of the rate cycle on the left side of slide you can see clear evidence of this stabilization pattern in our net interest income and net interest margin trends our nim decreased by basis points in  basis points in  and only basis associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 points here in  on a dollar basis our  nii was essentially flat decreasing by less than million during the quarter while its true that this flattening effect was a function of the stabilization i described previously we also received partial benefit from the balance sheet repositioning we announced during  because the sale of mortgage loans did not officially settle until late december the benefit we saw was primarily driven by the securities sale and reinvestment that settled in november assuming both transactions were completed at the beginning of  this would have represented approximately basis points of incremental lift to our nim during the quarter we expect the full impact of our balance sheet repositioning to take hold here in the first quarter as weve discussed throughout the year however were not relying solely on the rate environment or balance sheet repositioning to dictate our earnings going forward our organic initiatives are designed to improve economics on both sides of the balance sheet to drive more durable interest income in future quarters whether its adding highquality customer loans attracting and deepening core customer deposit relationships or layering in interest rate hedges these actions have been designed to enable our company to achieve a higher level of profitability through the cycle altogether the funding cost pressures from elevated rates and mix shift have slowed to a trickle but they havent stopped completely as such weve not yet called the bottom on our nim that we believe were nearly there based on our current expectations for balance sheet growth deposit betas and fed action we expect net interest income growth of between and in this guidance assumes six basis point fed rate cuts throughout the year beginning in march on slide we continue to manage our securities book to remain within our to target during the fourth quarter with benefits of our securities repositioning starting to take hold in  the average yield on our securities book is now risen by basis points since the same period a year ago we also leveraged the securities repositioning as a way to build our cash position during  largely as a result of the macro rate improvements we saw during the quarter and our securities sale we saw a meaningful improvement in our aoci in  after adjusting our cet1 capital ratio to include the impacts of aoci this impact would have represented a basis point hit to cet1 in  the spread of this impact narrowed significantly when compared to  as a percentage of total assets our investment security and cash positions grew to roughly during  for we will continue to target investments to total assets of between to our noninterest income trends are highlighted on slide as andy mentioned our gaap results reflected a net loss for the fourth quarter and this loss was driven by onetime items tied to the balance sheet repositioning we announced in november specifically we recognized a onetime million loss on the sale of mortgages and another million loss on the securities sale adjusting for these results our fourth quarter noninterest income came in at million representing a slight increase for the fourth consecutive quarter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 our underlying results were primarily driven by a million gain on the sale of ph visa b  along with increases in wealth management capital markets boli and other income these results were partially offset by a million decrease in mortgage banking fees and a million decrease in service fees taken together we view our core trends as evidence of durability in our fee income in a year that was challenged by market dynamics and changes to fee structure as we look to we expect noninterest income to compress by to as compared to our adjusted base of million moving to slide our fourth quarter expenses were also heavily impacted by a onetime item the special assessment finalized by the fdic during the quarter resulted in a million expense added to our results excluding this one item our adjusted noninterest expense came in at million in  the bulk of the quarterly increase stemmed from investments in our organic initiatives of note severance associated with the reduction in force we announced in  in tandem with an acceleration of hiring drove a million increase in personnel expense for the quarter as andy mentioned weve seen strong momentum in the hiring of talent whether filling key leadership roles or adding commercial bankers to our footprint thanks to a strong candidate pool and a growing view that associated as an employer of choice in the marketplace weve been able to pull our hiring plans forward this acceleration did drive an increase in  expense but it also positions us to accelerate execution on our strategy for the full year our adjusted noninterest expense came in at million while we continue to invest in our strategies to support our growth aspirations we are committed to keeping expense growth in check over the long term on an ongoing basis we will continue to review our expense base and optimize where possible with that in mind we expect total noninterest expense growth of between and in off of our adjusted base of million we also expect annual operating leverage of between negative and in shifting to slide we saw a basis point improvement in our tce ratio during the quarter finishing the year at our regulatory capital levels fell slightly as a result of the balance sheet repositioning we announced in  but our cet1 ratio still remains well within our target range at as of given current market conditions and the expectations for shortterm rates to remain elevated in the near term we expect tce to remain in the range of between and in we also expect cet to remain in the range of to over the same timeframe ill now hand it over to our chief credit officer pat ahern to provide us an update on credit quality patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp thanks derek id like to start with an allowance update on slide weve utilized the moodys november baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the moodys baseline forecast remains consistent with a resilient economy despite the high interest rate environment the baseline forecast contains no additional rate hikes slower but positive gdp growth rates a cooling labor market and continued deceleration of inflation our acll increased by million during the quarter to million our allowance continues to be driven by loan growth in select areas such as auto nominal credit movement and general macroeconomic trends that reflect the stability of our midwest footprint associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 as such our reservestoloan ratio increased by basis points versus the prior quarter and by basis points versus the same period a year ago landing at in  note that the loan sale and the corresponding portfolio reduction contributed basis points of the total increase or a adjusted from in  moving to slide our portfolio has largely continued to hold up well as evidenced by our core credit quality trends during the fourth quarter we saw net decreases in nonperforming assets nonaccrual loans and charge offs we did see a slight uptick in our delinquent loans ratio during the quarter this increase from recent levels was primarily focused within a few credits managed by our special loan group as with many workout credits negotiations can be prolonged and the resolution for most of these credits did not take place until after yearend overall outside of these specific situations we remain comfortable in the normalized level of delinquencies around the bank also impacting this ratio is the mortgage sale we completed in  reducing the denominator by the million this sale represented about a basis point of impact in  we added another million in provision a million decrease from the prior quarter the decrease was the result of a million release from mortgage sale partially offset by a build from limited credit movement and macro trends as we shift into we remain focused on monitoring the uncertainty in the macro economy to ensure current underwriting reflects the elevated inflation supply chain disruption and labor cost to name just a few economic concerns in addition we continue to maintain specific attention to the effects of elevated interest rates on the portfolio including ongoing interest rate sensitivity analysis bankwide going forward we expect any provision adjustments to continue to reflect changes in risk rates economic conditions loan volumes and other indications of credit quality finally as weve done in prior quarters weve provided a refreshed set of key metrics for our cre portfolio on slide as weve discussed our conservative approach to credit has been optimized over the course of the past several years as weve built a diverse portfolio of highquality commercial loans across our portfolios and a focus on prime and superprime consumer portfolios while cre continues to be cited as an area of risk in the industry we feel well positioned given the conservative approach weve applied across the bank in building our cre portfolio weve focused on partnering with well known developers and built a portfolio predominantly in stable midwest markets over twothird of our cre portfolio is based in the midwest with an emphasis on multifamily and industrial properties office loans represent just of our total loans as a bank and within that portfolio we are weighted towards nonurban class a properties the uptick in delinquencies were some of those same special loan group credits referenced earlier we continue to take a proactive approach to cre office credits with the majority of those maturing in the first half of already having strategies in place whether that be refinanced sale or qualifying for extensions at prevailing underwriting standards while we feel well positioned given our business model approach in the markets we operate in we continue to monitor this and all of our portfolios closely associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 with that i will now hand it back to andy to share some closing thoughts andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp so ill close out our formal presentation by reiterating a couple of key points from our presentation on slide first our strategy is designed to drive quality relationshipfocused loan growth that decreases our reliance on lower yielding nonrelationship balances and enhances our profitability profile based on the expected benefits of our plan and the current macro outlook we expect total loan growth of between and in on the other side of the balance sheet the deposit environment is much more stable than it was just six months ago but it remains competitive coming off two straight quarters of core deposit growth gives us confidence were on the right track with our initiatives and we expect to benefit further as phase initiatives ramp up as such we expect core customer deposit growth of to in shifting to the income statement weve adjusted our most recent forecast for balance sheet growth deposit betas and the rate environment our current forecast assumes six fed rate cuts beginning in march taking all these factors into account we now expect to deliver net interest income growth of between and in and lastly our disciplined approach to expenses remains a foundational focus for our company while well continue to seek smart investments for organizational growth we will look to offset those costs where possible by shifting dollars from underperforming areas taken together with current marketing conditions we expect non interest expense growth of to in with that lets open it up for questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you and at this time well conduct our questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from daniel tamayo with raymond james please state your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you good afternoon everybody maybe just starting with a clarification on the margin guidance first when you say youre not calling a bottom on the nim but it could move down slightly im assuming youre taking into account the basis point benefit of the restructuring and like a pro forma nim before that or is it are you talking about on an absolute basis andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp let me start that off and ill have derek finish that daniel what were saying is the core underlying business outside of the inorganic action is pretty close to bottom could it go down basis point or basis points perhaps but were pretty darn close we dont see a lot of volatility in the underlying margin on top of that we expect to see the full force of the increase that we outlined from the inorganic actions starting in  and then based on what were doing on our production and balance sheet we expect to have a positive trend throughout the year derek derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think thats right and youre right were talking about looking at our start point levels at the pro forma daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay all right thank you just wanted to make sure and then i guess sorry go ahead okay derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp no go ahead daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc yeah no just following up on the nim guidance youve got six rate cuts in there wondering if you can kind of frame for us what that looks like either on a per cut basis or if it was going to be more in line with the feds guidance of three cuts in the back half of the year how that would impact the guidance derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think the easiest the only way weve modeled this ph probably most recently to developing sensitivities is what if you dont get the first cut so you get five cuts and that pulls through you dont get the march cut thats probably worth about or basis points to us for the year associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and just to be clear so the rate cut is punitive to the margin youre saying right youre still asset sensitive derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp we are still asset sensitive you can get into a longer discussion about what do you does the front end of the curve get cut or do you have a parallel shift but the most likely scenario is weve tried to plan conservatively with the six rate cuts and then thought about what if you dont get all six and that does reflect asset sensitivity daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay i appreciate that and then my second question i just wanted to get a little high level here andy you guys have taken on some pretty big changes since youve been at associated im just curious given the uncertainty going forward but certainly what youve the changes that youve made if theres any kind of profitability forecast or not forecast but targets that you had in mind that you could share or just kind of guideposts that we should be thinking about as the bank goes through these transformations andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp daniel i just want to say we expect profit to go up and i was going to stop after that but in all seriousness what i would say is the plans that weve put together when you expand your lending verticals when you expand your product offering when you modernize your digital platform and decrease your attrition when you see a turning point on household growth when you start deepening customer segments on the deposit side the reason that we think that we have an opportunity is because weve put in the work in phase phase is simply extending what weve done in the past so when we extend on the commercial side the pieces that weve had when we extend on the marketing side to the platforms that we already have with a company that has a large wholesale reliance on the funding side we can either replace that or fund the loan growth we have and either way that leads to increased profitability so what i would say is i dont have a specific number outside of the guidance weve just now given but we feel very good about achieving the guidance that weve given daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc terrific thank you for all the color andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp youre welcome patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp thanks daniel operator our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please state your question associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question so derek wanted to i guess i just want to try to be as clear as possible on the margin so just on a stated basis the margin should go up right from here derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp right yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay good and the starting point for sort of the core at this point is like the and we get some additional benefit due to the fullquarter impact of the restructuring is that a good way to frame it derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so just to connect the dots we expected about a basis point improvement right we got ended up getting about of it this quarter we got another to go and so any other movement in nim is the underlying bau r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp and i think thats what andy is trying to get out about ph whether were calling the bottom but on a reported basis we expect to go up r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then andy just on the notion of positive operating leverage and its going to be sort of close call this year it kind of feels to me like a rounding error more or less if its zero to negative i guess maybe major levers that in your view would make it harder or easier to achieve and i guess sort of a related question derek just to go back on the trajectory of rates if we only got if we got fewer rates than the six youve assumed that would be better for your nii guide is that correct derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp correct r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah going back to it i mean i dont want to be contrite on this but were in the business of doing loans and deposits and the deposit market if we had a significant headwind that could create a challenge what gives me confidence going into is the second half of so the deposit market was challenged for the year but we had a sixmonth growth rate of so clearly if you have a funding issue that costs more then you have a challenge but we dont see that as of the trend right now the second piece of it is that we emphasize with the team is the importance of getting out of the gate with good commercial bankers and i say good commercial bankers we have a very good team already weve attracted talent over the last two years that im pleased with and then we have people that were here before that are talented so when we add bankers over the course of months were adding very highquality bankers and so it takes days to ramp up then you accelerate at months months months so for that the question is how quickly can we get quality bankers and the answer so far is quite quickly the next question is how quickly can they ramp up their pipeline and well see what that timing is and so that could be a positive for us and that could create the biggest execution risk but as i sit here and i look at the hiring and where they come from and what theyve done in their past that gives me some confidence that were right on track with what weve suggested the third part of it as i do think expenses are controllable and going through the exercise expense exercise linebyline businessbybusiness categorybycategory in the detail that we went through that and already outlined it and have specific measurements on it gives me confidence that well be able to execute on the expense line item of the budget r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you very much andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp thanks scott operator our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens please state your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good evening everybody maybe just start with an expense question could you maybe just talk about the trajectory of quarterly expenses in given kind of some of the hiring plans and initiatives throughout the year associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah terry the way this is derek the way it works out in our current forecast is its pretty flat for most of the quarters during the year so that implies coming down a little bit off the core fourth quarter that we have and then flat going forward the hiring plans obviously have started this quarter and have been pleasantly weve had pleasant results at the speed and interest so we dont want to slow that down and then we obviously look at the other areas where we have control and discretionary expenses to make sure that we have a balanced timing but theres not a hockey stick implied in there were mindful of where were going to finish the year in delivering economics and setting ourselves up for also terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then the company has aggressive deposit growth goals this year versus peers and andy just ran through what gives you guys the confidence derek i guess for you how are you modeling deposit betas where do you think theyll peak and if the forward curve is correct and we get the rate cuts how are you thinking about betas on the way down derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so we think theyll peak obviously at the end of the first quarter around theres a number of ways of looking at them but if you start the betas going down were probably looking at between and the challenge as you know is how long after the last rate hike and hopefully weve had ours do ph does competitions keep rates high before they start cutting it and we tested that in the fourth quarter i may have shared before with lowering some of our cd rates and competitors even large banks kept the rates high and so we went back to our sevenmonth cd because of that so i feel good about our plans theyre not all rate driven but rates matter and so i think thats ph how id answer that andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp terry ill also reiterate when i got here almost three years ago now we were quite asset sensitive and weve drawn that asset sensitivity significantly down so were not playing in the same space as we were three years ago relative to the market or even our bank terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks for taking my questions andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please state your question jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 thanks good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jon derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp hey jon jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey a question on loan growth drivers on slide that you lay out i guess it could be as well but what do you think that looks like in a year where are you seeing the opportunities to generate that kind of loan growth andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well a few different areas well have very modest growth in cre and be mindful of what the market is clearly if we add to commercial bankers we expect for them to increase their productivity and right now were saying that should be about for the year i think its roughly billion increase versus what run rate is then the question of what run rate really is and i would tell you that i think utilization was slightly down last year and i think thats unlikely i think there is a dislocation in the regional banking market that i dont anticipate having again this year we had some purposeful runoff in ci that we were able to get out of some loans at par that we thought would be wise if theres softening and so when i look at commercial i think between the quality of people we have and the program we have and the focus we have and those other items i mentioned and the addition of rms i fully expect that to be one of the significant drivers of growth for us well have steady growth in auto and that steady growth will kind of grow at a decreasing pace each year that we go along as we execute on our commercial plans the other thing is and i know you asked about but this is a program that continues to build on itself as you well know when you bring in quality commercial bankers it takes time for them to grow their pipeline and their portfolio but as we head to the end of the year having had people on as we got people on and we will have significant amounts of this hiring done in the first half of the year meaning that they will have fully formed pipelines as we head into the end of the year heading into so i think you can see that as a continuation of the balanced reshift of our portfolio that leads to profitability improvement jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay fair enough derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp jon maybe i can add one titbit also because andy will remind me later that i didnt bring it up we do expect and as part of our strategy with the transaction we did for the portfolio growth to change from a residential real estate orientation that we had before so we are in that business we have switched our product mix and made associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 investments to support originate to sell and then judiciously use our portfolio for arms and wealth but that mix of our total loans should drop by the end of to about of our loans being resi and in something more like so you sort of have to have that piece in the equation to help make the nii and the nim guidance work the way we expect it to andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp and translated from mortgage the importance of that is were doggedly determined to lend to our customers our customers ph defined that people that do full business relationships people that deposit with us and tend to do that on the construction lending side for depositors and intend to do that on our core business but the thirdparty origination is something that we no longer do and that will change the trajectory over time of the residential real estate book jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay okay got it and i guess mass affluent is probably tied in with that as well on resi andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp it absolutely is jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay just two more kind of more hypothetical but back to scotts positive operating leverage question andy would you be spending and investing more if the revenue environment were more robust or do you feel like you have everything you need from a budget point of view right now andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thats a great question well what i would say is were being pretty aggressive on the hiring on the commercial banker side and no were not looking to fill seats were looking to hire talent and so as we get good folks in if theres an opportunity ive said all along to each line of business if you find somebody that you believe is a game changer you should hire them so we will but that being said theres only so fast youre going to be able to hire responsibly and so we like the plan that we have if we add the to bankers this year and theyre all very strong i like where this company is going based on everything else that we have in flight that being said i promised halfway through the year i will be asking our executive leaders okay now what whats next on the deposit front what other initiatives can drive returns what is the next phase of what we see being important in banking and to me really thats just the way you stay ahead of the curve and i will tell you over the last almost three years now i felt like we had a first phase and we ran hard to get that as foundational the second phase is additive and the third phase is lets get ahead of the market so i like the path were on and well think about investments that way frankly for as long as im here jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 okay all right good in the interest of time ill leave it there and save the others ph from me andy have a good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp have a good night operator our next question comes from timur braziler with wells fargo securities please state your questions thank you timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp hey timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc looking at the deposit guidance for can you just maybe talk us through the expectation for mix shift and what the potential for mix shift out of noninterestbearing remains here in the near term andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp you want to take that derek derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah ill take ill answer the first part of it the big challenge obviously has been aside from interestbearing has been whats happening in the noninterestbearing that has slowed down quite a bit the way weve got our outlook shaping up is we expect us to bottom at about billion or billion and then finish the year up a little over billion i know people use the shorthand of percent of deposits but that includes brokered and its just easier for us to communicate the absolute dollar expectation and thats whats in our guidance and our expectations associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp and ill just say that a different way is that were a pretty low point on noninterestbearing its what gives me confidence to say that i dont think theres a big story in margin destruction in the first quarter so whether we call bottom right now or we call it during the first quarter i think youre only talking or basis points and so i think the story comes into can you shift your balance sheet can you bring in full relationships can you put loans on the books that have a little bit better yield and can you grow deposits overall so i think from a position of margin decrease i think were quickly closing in on the bottom timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks for that and then as we start looking at rate cuts derek did i hear correct that betas on the way down youre expecting to and if thats not correct and i guess on the way down what do you expect the deposit beta to be and is there going to be a lag for the first couple of rate cuts before that beta actually kicks in derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp that assumption includes a lag assumption but i cant say weve formalized a view on it were going to try and be as early as we can while still hitting our growth numbers and we position the balance sheet that way our brokered cd portfolio has a contractual maturity that runs the whole thing down and gives us options by the end of the year and of our billion in the customer cds billion of that is scheduled to roll over this year and of that by the end of july so were trying to be very opportunistic while still growing and giving us lots of pricing options so that we can take advantage of any opportunities and keep the beta where wed like to have it timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great and then just last for me you mentioned this briefly in your prepared comments but maybe can you just talk to the cadence of office paydowns in patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp office paydowns yeah i mean we saw i think in a good trend of office we had a handful of probably half of the deals that we came through our maturities end of were payoffs i think its still going to be kind of a similar pattern but its all casebycase weve got about i think the ones that were kind of circled for the first half of about of them are going to either refinance or sell and thats the strategy put in place the others are going to well we have extensions in place or they qualified for extensions but thats under the current environment so its still a mixed bag clients are starting to the office market is hard to tell i think that stabilization is still early to call that i think in other areas were seeing payoffs from multifamily as longterm rates have come down i think were starting to see a lot of clients kind of move off the sidelines there and the industrial market as well were still its not as hot as it was two years ago certainly but still a pretty steady pace of leaseup and therefore sale in that asset class as well associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just the maturities for office both in the first half and for the year if you have those numbers patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp first half of the year weve got about 140somemillion in maturing office loans coming up and like i said weve kind of circled the majority of those with strategies in place andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp ill just close out on timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp commercial real estate by saying weve had five straight quarters without a chargeoff we like how that portfolio is holding up were all over both the office portfolio and the overall cre portfolio and frankly the experience level of our bankers in the cre group is very strong and i think relative to the industry we feel pretty good about the position were in certainly it could be lumpy as time goes by but have a pretty good handle on that thank you for the questions operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please state your question nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi this is nick moutafakis on for chris mcgratty how are you guys doing andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp good nick derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp good nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe just on the capital levels given as we move through and further out any appetite for a buyback or even further tweaking or derisking of the loan portfolio as we look more longer term associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp nick i like our organic plan if we can hire the most talent in the industry and grow our balance sheet in the key areas that we have i believe the investment community will be happy with the return so thats where our entire focus is right now with regards to another action on the portfolio we dont have anything planned there at this time and buybacks that is not front and center for me i think we have ways to use our capital that well be happy with the midterm and longterm results nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then just on the cash flow from the bond book do you guys have like the quarterly cadence of runoff for the securities derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp its about to and because were growing it with fixed assets you would expect to reinvest maybe ph million so think of a runoff ph million purchase quarter and then the spread on that the runoff rate versus the buy rate would be basis point difference nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you for taking my questions andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you nick operator our next question comes from brody preston with ubs please state your question brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good afternoon everyone andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey i just wanted to ask a handful of questions on the nii derek just want to put a finer point on the beta commentary was that to what you expect to achieve by yearend or is that more of a comment about what it will be over the next couple of years associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thats march to december of this year brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc march to december thank you very much for that within the core deposit growth guidance that you guys have laid out how much of that is coming from cds derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i dont think weve provided that level of detail i think its going to depend on the market brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp id be happy to ph go through the mix detail i gave you already on the noninterestbearing deposits and the residential real estate brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i want it all derek indiscernible derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i wanted to say it when you said five questions or six questions or whatever it was andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i did ask derek why hes providing so much detail and he said brody demands it brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc this is true im a little bit of a pain in the butt i just wanted to also ask on the btfp i noticed in the appendix you kind of called out how much you have in capacity i wanted to ask how much of the btfp youve used at this point derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp as of the end of the year none associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc none okay thank you very much for that i felt like i had one more for you guys andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp that said brody i feel compelled brody i feel compelled to say that i wouldnt be afraid to draw on that in fact i think theres a reason that its put in place and if we can get advantageous terms relative to the market then well use it brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it last couple for me on the loan growth guide wanted to better understand another mix question how much of that how much of the growth youre expecting to come from the auto portfolio derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp were looking at similar levels that youve seen quarterafterquarter so in dollar terms its about million to million brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then the last one i had for you just on the auto yields the pickup this quarter was pretty strong at basis points wanted to understand if given the growth guidance that you just outlined for auto what we can expect for maybe the yield cadence from a repricing perspective within that book derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp were not providing that specific guidance on that nice try andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp but i think you had a nice pickup from the fourth quarter look the business is a good business for us and the average fico in december was so when you think about an opportunity when you see the yields that were getting and you see the quality of the credit weve said before we dont want to just be the auto bank but its a nice portfolio for us that is performing well that were getting a good yield on and has a very very strong underlying credit ph with that derek s meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah what is fair to say brody despite my snarky comment there was the spreads that weve seen and ive talked about the sweet spot has been getting sweeter i think ive said that a couple of times it really did stay that way fourth quarter and it has stayed that way now so the inputs that are driving that sequential type of rate increase are still strong associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it most of the book is most of your auto business used used car auto used autos patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president presidentchicago market associated banccorp no
