joining me today are chris niles our cfo and pat ahern our chief credit officer before discussing our results for the fourth quarter and full year id like to say a few words about the ceo transition we also just announced after years with associated i announced my plans today to retire at the end of ive been thinking about this for some time and in consultation with the board we agreed this is the right time to initiate our succession process as noted in the press release i will continue as president and ceo until my successor is in place at which time ill step down from both of those roles and from the board ill be available to the new ceo in an advisory capacity thereafter to assure a smooth transition for our colleagues the board has commenced a search for a permanent successor and well consider our internal as well as external candidates as you can appreciate we cannot speculate on the timeline for that search but the board and i are highly confident that well name a strong successor who will take associated to its next phase of success continue our profitable growth trajectory i look forward to working with my successor to ensure a smooth and seamless transition but now let me turn to our fourth quarter and full year results this was a year unlike any of us has experienced in the midst of incredible challenges and uncertainty the commitment of our colleagues shown through covid changed every aspect of life including how people and businesses bank in navigating the unknown it was essential that our customers were able to connect to count on us and that our teams were safe and well positioned to provide their support as businesses and schools shut down we found new ways to support both the health and financial wellbeing of our customers and communities through the efforts of our colleagues we were able to support our customers with over billion of ppp loans and adapt our branch services as our customers shifted to remote banking it goes without saying that will have many challenges however the arrival of the covid19 vaccines promise a return to normality perhaps its only fitting this year we will celebrate our year as a company and our rich history of supporting our customers and communities in their times of need as we have through the decades we stand eager to help build a stronger economy and better society during we took several actions to prepare for the recovery we expect to see in on slide you can see the improving trends for a number of key items with the sudden decline in interest rates this past year we quickly moved to reduce funding costs and implement strategies to stabilize and increase our asset yields together these actions helped drive margins higher during the fourth quarter in addition beginning in the second quarter we took several steps to increase the efficiency of our organization included was the sale of associated benefits and risk consulting the third quarter efficiency initiatives reducing branches and personnel costs and the recently announced sale of whitnell our family office subsidiary taken together these actions will help drive further improvement in our efficiency and expense run rate as we move into we adopted cecl on january and as the pandemic began to unfold we moved swiftly to increase our allowance in contemplation of the economy we saw through the middle of the year as we move further through the back half of the year we were encouraged by the positive emerging trajectory of the economy and as we associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 closed out the year were very pleased with the low levels of deferrals and new problem loans which allowed us to bring down our provisioning over the back half of notably we posted a net reserve release of million during the fourth quarter collectively these positive trends drove the eps improvement we saw in the fourth quarter we recorded a of gaap earnings per share for the fullyear or a when adjusted for the gain on sale of associated benefits and risk consulting turning to slide lets drill further into some of these positive trends for the quarter our fourth quarter eps was up more than from the third quarter we saw our net interest margin expand basis points to driven by expanding commercial and industrial loan yields and ppp accretion from forgiveness we ended the year with fourth quarter over fourth quarter average loan growth of billion or mortgage warehouse and cre lending continued to be strong performers during the quarter we continue to grow our lowcost deposits which accounted for of total deposits at the end of the cost of interest bearing deposits declined significantly throughout the year during the fourth quarter the cost of interest bearing deposits excluding time deposits was just basis points the provision for credit losses was million during the quarter down from million in the third quarter loan deferrals fell to less than million and both nonaccruals and potential problem loans declined our allowance reserve covered of loans at the end of the year we finished the year on a strong capital note tangible book value per share increased to and all our regulatory capital ratios were higher year over year on slide weve provided a summary of our pretax preprovision income weve also highlighted several significant initiatives which we executed over the year and their impact on ptpp adjusted for these significant items ptpp was million for the year on slide we provide a similar view for the fourth quarter excluding the gain on sale of branches fourth quarter ptpp was million average annual loan balance trends are shown on slide total average loans came in at billion up billion or for the year ppp lending and cre activity accounted for most of the years growth commercial and business lending increased million or from this was driven by ppp lending and mortgage warehouse financing we also continued to reduce our oil and gas exposure to only million at the end of the year oil and gas outstandings now represent just a little more than of our total loans average commercial real estate loans grew over million as customers continue to build projects particularly industrial and distribution center projects across our footprint construction lending has been particularly resilient in the upper midwest and our unfunded commercial real estate commitments stood at billion at year end reflecting a healthy amount of expected further growth as we move into we originated a record billion of mortgages during the year driven by the lower mortgage rate environment despite this average consumer loans finished the year at billion down million the low rate environment encouraged refinancing activity across our markets and contributed to the further rundown in our home equity book weve been reluctant to add low rate mortgages to our balance sheet but we have benefited from the sale of originated mortgage loans in the form of mortgage banking fees turning to slide we highlight changes in the quarterly loan trend compared to  of average fourth quarter loans increased billion commercial real estate loans increased million and commercial and associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 business lending increased billion including ppp loans on a sequential quarter basis fourth quarter average loans fell million from the third quarter this decline was mostly attributable to ppp forgiveness which we began to see in the fourth quarter through yearend about of our ppp loans have been repaid or forgiven looking out to outstanding ppp round one and two loans should be largely paid off or forgiven during the first half we are currently originating new round three ppp loans and expect these to peak in  and then decline toward yearend with respect to residential mortgages we protect balances to be flattish throughout the year as new mortgage portfolio production and increasing home equity production and utilization are more or less offset by the negative impacts of the ongoing refi market on these categories we are optimistic about commercial loan demand in specifically we expect commercial real estate growth to continue at a strong pace and to increase average cre balances by to during the year we are also anticipating commercial line utilization expansion that should add to to outstandings particularly as we move into the back half of this year taken together we expect fullyear commercial loan growth that is commercial real estate and commercial and industrial combined of to on slide weve summarized our covid19 relief efforts for the year during the second quarter deferrals peaked at approximately billion at yearend deferrals were just million we saw very positive trends throughout the year were very pleased with where we ended most customers who received deferrals have not needed additional assistance and have been able to resume making normal payments total deferrals make up just basis points of our total loans at yearand the remaining deferrals are primarily residential mortgage borrowers that are still in their initial sixmonth deferral period we expect substantially all of these consumer deferrals to be cured or expire without any credit implications in the coming quarter our allowance update is shown on slide we utilized moodys dec baseline forecast for our cecl forward looking assumptions the baseline forecast assumes additional stimulus continuing low rates through and a covid vaccine that becomes widely available late in this quarter we had previously indicated that we expected to taper our reserving as we move through the year and in fact our fourth quarter reflects a net reserve release of million while we set aside million as a provision for the quarter we also charged up million resulting in a net lower quarteroverquarter total allowance this net release was driven by a million gross reduction in our allowance related to our general commercial and business lending portfolios this gross release was partially offset by million of additional reserves set aside for commercial real estate loans the commercial real estate reserves are driven by the fact that our construction loan portfolio has grown by over yeartodate and that we reserve for the full committed amount on a construction loan at inception as of december our total allowance was million down from million at the end of the third quarter similarly our ratio of reserves to loans was about flat to our credit metrics are presented on slide potential problem loans nonaccrual loans and net chargeoffs all declined during the quarter our key covid commercial exposures also continue to decline and notably our oil and gas retail and restaurant exposure all declined during the quarter wed also note that we had no oil and gas net chargeoffs this quarter and were comforted that with oil prices currently holding above a barrel we are associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 well reserved going into 2021assuming the positive credit dynamics continue we expect our full year provision to be no more than million with some quarterly variability turning to slide annual average deposits were billion up nearly billion or over at the end of lowcost deposits grew approximately billion compared to the end of at the same time we reduced highcost time deposits and network deposits by over billion these are alltime record deposit levels for associated customers and are a testament to the resiliency of our systems and our ability to continue to attract and retain core customers in a low rate and largely remote banking environment were also happy to report our customer satisfaction ratings have never been higher our customer interaction and call center survey data suggest our customers have been wellserved despite many of our branch lobbies being closed for part of this year further our mobile applications continue to be refreshed and have been very wellreceived by our customers whove given us a star rating out of on the most popular mobile platform turning to slide fourth quarter average deposits were billion lowcost noninterest bearing and savings were up from the third quarter while network and time deposits declined yet again lowcost deposits accounted for nearly of our balances at the end of the year turning to slide fourth quarter net interest income was million up million from the third quarter and net interest margin of was up basis points from the third quarter we had previously guided that net interest margin would bottom out during the third quarter and pickup in  as expected margin hit bottom in july and august and then rebounded to in december asset yields benefited from our implementation of libor floors reduced investment activity and generally widening spreads on new loans on the liability side we benefited from lower levels of borrowings driven by the influx of customer deposits which drove our funding costs down this persistent customer liquidity encouraged us to repay billion of ppp loan funding in november we also aggressively repriced our consumer deposit book yet still have million in plus cds which will mature in the first half of we expect spreads to widen on our liborbased commercial loans as we continue to implement new libor floors into our new and renewing loans this will happen over time or in conjunction with other repricing or credit actions including the anticipated migration to sofr and other indices away from libor later in we continue to expect to see our margin expand as we move throughout the year we expect our net interest margin to be relatively flat in the first quarter and to gradually expand over the course of the second through fourth quarters wed expect the full years margin to be between and turning to slide fourth quarter noninterest income came in at million mortgage banking service charges and wealth management fees all contributed to this quarters growth we also recorded million of deposit premiums on our previously announced branch sales our mortgage banking activity remains strong this quarter with nearly million of mortgages sold to the agencies generating million in net fee revenue we also picked up nearly million of msr recovery during the fourth quarter and still have over million in temporarily impaired msr at yearend we expect mortgage banking activity to remain somewhat elevated as we move into the year service charges and deposit account fees came in at million an increase of million quarteroverquarter wealth fees also increased nearly million reflecting the strong equity market dynamics on january we announced the sale of our whitnell family office subsidiary which constitutes a little less than of the wealth management revenues and is focused on the ultrahigh net worth market pro forma for the sale we retain associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 approximately billion of assets under management as we look forward in net of the pending whitnell sale we expect noninterest income of million to million in on slide we highlight our expenses the third quarter came in at million inside of the million level we were targeting core expenses continue to trend lower largely driven by the reduction of expense following the sale of abrc and the branch sales which mostly closed in december we expect the expense initiatives to provide further savings as we move into as you can see from the charts on the right our efficiency trends continue to improve and our adjusted expenses to average assets ratio is already trending to given these positive dynamics and the pending sale of whitnell were revising our fullyear expense guidance down to approximately million as shown on slide our regulatory capital levels remain strong our common equity tier ratio increased basis points from the third quarter and has grown basis points from the first quarter as we conserved capital in light of economic uncertainty our tce ratio grew basis points from the third quarter benefiting from solid earnings and lower asset levels as we used excess cash to reduce higher cost deposits and our ppp loans began to be forgiven as we look forward into we expect to resume opportunistic share repurchases this quarter we will continue to target tce levels at or above and cet1 at or above so to wrap up on slide were providing guidance for we expect fullyear net interest margin of basis points to basis points we expect mortgage banking revenue to moderate but noninterest income still to come in between million to million were revising our expense guidance down to approximately million from the million previously guided our provision for credit losses has trended down since the second quarter to an annualized fourth quarter run rate of about million with the positive credit trends were seeing and assuming the economy behaves positively as is generally expected we believe our full year provision will be at or better than million with some quarterly variability and we expect our annual tax rate to normalize in the to range and with that well be happy to take any of your questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please state your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon everybody can you hear me philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hi jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes how are you jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc well great thanks phil congratulations i hope you get to really enjoy your last full winter up in green bay and get the most out of it congratulations on the next step and we look forward to working with the rest of the team i guess maybe starting with the margin i think that your guidance is pretty good its better than what were seeing out of most and would love to hear i guess where are you seeing the new loan yield you talked about getting better spreads and putting in some libor floors where are we seeing new loans coming on right now and do you think that thats going to be sustainable for the next quarter or so philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah thanks for the question jared ill let chris answer that but just to what you said yes winter is cooperating it was degrees here yesterday so i am still enjoying that chris do you want to take the nim question christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so jared we would point you to about the slide in the margin page in the deck page in the tables i would say that the core commercial and business lending spreads have widened and its a combination of the strategy to have floors inserted in loan so years ago they started that sort of phase those out and weve been reinserting them through the course of the year and that started to basically lift our core yield on the loans to associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 spread it in fact doesnt change is the baseline goes from libor in the teens to something like libor at basis points or basis points depending upon the type of loan and were seeing a good maintenance of the spreads in commercial real estate with lending so not necessarily widening but not compressing either and the new loans arent resulting in material shift to that and so the combination of the new stuff coming on at reasonable spreads in commercial real estate the slightly better mix of construction the total real estate and the libor floor strategy is really the contributing factors to the expansion youve seen in that commercial loan yields and then as we mentioned or still mentioned on residential mortgages weve really been holding the line and were not terribly excited about putting to handle mortgages into the portfolio and so weve been selling most of that production to the agencies and so the book that were left with isnt growing but at least it has something in the neighborhood of a ph yield jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats great and then im assuming that that margin guidance assumes the benefit from this initial ppp loans but anything coming out of the newest round is not included in that is that correct christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp so weve given a full year guidance for the to thats sort of a good indicator for the entire year but yeah what i just walked you through on our spreads is all excluding ppp we break out commercial ppp as a balance than as a yield and a spread independently for you on all of our tables and materials jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes but with the newest round thats coming out i guess what should we be thinking volume to look like on that compared to what we saw earlier in call it third quarter peak philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp ill take that chris as we christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sit right now weve already received more than thousand applications for 150ish million i dont know its hard to prognosticate how much theres going to be we did billion in the first two rounds last year the rules are a little bit more difficult this time around so itll certainly be something less than that but i its kind of hard to hazard a guess associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right totally get that and then just shifting to the core loan growth looking at your guidance expecting to increase in ci you also talked about utilization improving and giving that or benefit so is that really youre not expecting a lot of necessarily core ci growth other than an improvement in utilization is that the right way to look at it philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah i think youre going to see most of our growth from the big backlog of commercial real estate fundings that will come were sitting at the end of the year at almost billion and theres additional new business there commercial utilization is as you know from looking at other banks across the industry is very low so we certainly think as the economy picks up well get more utilization to maybe a little bit conservative its just its hard to know what the general commercial borrower or when the general commercial borrower is going to feel comfortable stepping up i think growth will be perhaps stronger in the second half jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess just finally for me looking at the allowance and the cecl impact looking at the allowance exppp of million is really strong i guess given the overall quality backdrop how much did you have to rely on qualitative overlays this quarter to get there and is that maybe a reduction of qualitative overlay is going to be the driving factor behind the provision guidance or does that not change philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp chris you want to take that one christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp did you get the question christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp so i think yeah jared in our modeling its not so much the qualitative overlay lets say the qualitative overlays have kept the reserve level because we try to think about reserve as being countercyclical and so with an improving forecast that captured and driven some of the numbers here in our modeling i think your question is as you think about that level of provision guidance that weve given you does that imply perhaps as the total reserve level is coming down over time i think the answer to that is yes jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 operator thank you our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens please go ahead terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good evening and phil congratulations on the retirement news its i cant believe its been years but congratulations philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc lets start on just on page im looking at the personnel expenses which have come down all year and weve seen that in the expense line my question is how much of that kind of fell to the bottom line last year and how much of it was kind of reinvested in the business i know in the past and maybe i missed it there was kind of a technology spend slide and maybe a few others philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah going forward much of this is falling to the bottom line weve been able to maintain a fairly stable tech spend although we continue to spend significant dollars on that so this change in personnel costs is really benefiting the bottom line terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then as a followup kind of your covid watch list portfolio slide here wondering if you could provide some updated thoughts on some of the larger portfolios particularly kind of the retailers and the retail reits that youve discussed in the past philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure pat you want to take that patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure right now were seeing some stabilization there the issues we had in the past have all been kind of circled in large part put behind us so i think were seeing in our portfolio a lot of these retail centers are collecting more theyre seeing increase in rent so thats been a positive the other one that stands out in terms of real estate is hotels obviously we have a pretty small exposure there relatively speaking and i would say weve kind of again circled all the issues and weve kind of put actions in place to continue to monitor those and get those hopefully through the next to months terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 thank you operator our next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler please state your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys and phil i wanted to add my congratulations as well i enjoyed working with you and look forward to this final year but wish you the best and thats wellearned i wanted to philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you scott im not done yet though so you probably havent done youre not done ph talking with them yet r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah no fair enough fair enough thats a good point i guess just on the search and just sort of the timing on announcement was there any thought to wait to announce until youd kind of gone through the search obviously its kind of a dicey thing with disclosure and stuff but any sense for why now and then ma has become another topic in the industry its gotten a lot more frothy more recently the search for a new ceo did that sort of put you guys off from looking at ph internal transactions yourself and then i guess conversely i guess one way to find a new ceo would be to partner with someone else and source the ceo that way just maybe any broader ma thoughts you could offer philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure so a bunch of questions in there first of all on timing ive been discussing this with the board for some time and as you point out at some point this is material and should be disclosed which is why were doing it now secondly i really think that we are very well positioned at this point with all the actions we took last year to really participate in the economic recovery so making this announcement now in the face of what we think is a improving and improving results for us makes some sense as far as ma as youve seen us been active over the last few years in acquisitions we will continue whether its me sitting here or perhaps someone else to look at those kind of opportunities and if we think theyre in the interests of our shareholders pursue them and as always as far as doing something more strategic the board with their responsibility to look out for shareholders is always open to looking at something like that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you and then maybe switching gears a bit i guess for chris probably most appropriate for you but as it relates to ppp would you mind sort of trying to embed that into what total loan growth will look like for the year inclusive of the ppp ebbs and flows between all these myriad rounds that are in there and then same thing on the margin how much will ppp forgiveness contribute in your existing guidance associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure so i think scott if you take a look at the transcript when you go back to it phil articulated that we really expect the bulk of the ppp ph that bears today just go away so thats the better part of the remaining portion and the large portion of round three so ppp on balance sheet will certainly be a nonmaterial number probably by the time we get to the end of in the grand scheme of things the fees that are remaining for from the round we disclose is million so theres million of unamortized fees that were largely assuming were going to receive next year and again as phil alluded to well figure out how much the new is but its not going to be on the same order of magnitude as the round one and round twos right so itll be a smaller number and itll mostly run through the year so itll be a little over million plus whatever happens for round three is whats basically assumed in the budget or the outlook r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay terrific all right well thank you both very much i appreciate it philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks scott operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please state your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good afternoon philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp good afternoon jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc phil im more interested in the ph lambo weather report for sunday philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp mid and likelihood of light snow jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right similar to ph foxborough associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp ph brady wont care but the rest of their team isnt going to like it jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i was just going to say similar to ph foxborough well good luck with that ill congratulate you after probably  earnings but just a question back on the ci piece of it that those balances have been coming down over the last several quarters and i just im curious if youre starting to see signs of life there it sounds like youre a little more bullish on that later in the year but are you starting to see some of those balances trough philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp weve had some really good success particularly in the fourth quarter with some new customers and some new closings and the pipelines are encouraging i mean that said low utilization has kind of masked that so i think its still a little early yet but we believe that vaccines are going to become much more widely available here and as the population starts to be able to access that its going to have a pretty big impact on growth so as i said the to is our forecast now but i would think that theres a decent likelihood that thats conservative but youre probably going to see it more in later quarters after the first quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then on the interestbearing demand growth if you guys had to put your finger on whats really driving that is it environmental is it you and how sticky do you think these balances are longer term philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp chris do you want to take that christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure i mean i would note that the rate on those is blending out at basis points so theyre not being affected by rate so were not its not a rate opportunity but i think it is generally the liquidity broadly across our commercial customer base and across in particular for these accounts the municipalities and various government entities level groups that have balances that have just nowhere else to go with their money in the short run there arent investment options that make too much sense either and basis points is better than and so i think thats generally the math that those customers are doing there in these types of accounts jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay and then resuming the repurchase program im just curious in your minds how attractive is that for you and how aggressive would you like to be thanks philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 yeah so all we can really say on that is we have what do we have about million plus of authorization right now and even though the stock has somewhat recovered were still trading at what would to us seem an attractive level to be purchasing stock at so not going to signal too much about what were going to do in the first quarter other than were going to resume jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay well you issued stock when you showed up and now youre buying it back right years later so thats good philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well weve been buying it back for a while so jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thank you philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks jon operator our next question comes from michael young with truist please state your question michael young q analyst truist securities inc thanks for the question ill followup on jons wellwishing so with the packers won that super bowl back close to when you started there so hopefully theyll bring one home for the indiscernible philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp that would be a good back that would be a good book end to this thing because i got here at the end of and they won the super bowl so yeah that would be perfect michael young q analyst truist securities inc yeah the timing could be unique well anyways maybe just following up on that kind of starting with just a high level question youve been here for going on years and just curious with what youve done in terms of credit cleanup and then efficiency improvement technology adaptation and rollout for the company through your career and im sure ive missed some things that you accomplished along the way but what do you see as kind of the core needs for the franchise going forward from here and just anything that we should be expecting maybe on a go forward basis philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 yeah its a great question appreciate that weve positioned ourselves well from a credit point of view as you point out we have a very disciplined credit culture i think if you look back to march of last year it was very hard to forecast how this was going to turn out but it appears at this point that this is going to be a very mild credit cycle we charged off about basis points of loans last year we expect something in a similar zip code to that and compared to what we were thinking in march its pretty mild now perhaps not every bank will have those results but we have relatively modest and broadly diversified exposure so yes i think were in good shape on credit weve invested a lot in tech thank goodness we did that because when we had to handle our customers remotely weve had a mobile app thats that works online works weve invested a lot of money in this and importantly we still have people working from home and weve been able to do things like handle a record amount of mortgage volume and such going forward the challenge for us is the same challenge as the whole industry faces weve got a basically zero interest rate environment stretching out for a couple three years so it behooves us to continue to work hard on finding efficiency so that we can grow our bottom line in that very difficult macro environment fortunately the economy to us looks like its going to improve and thatll give us some tailwind as we get into the year but doing things well doing them efficiently is the biggest challenge we have in this rate environment michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay i appreciate that perspective phil and maybe just following up on kind of the loan growth outlook i think you mentioned still resi is not super attractive at these yields although maybe better than securities but it seems like the swing factor and kind of growth for outside of just the macro lift in commercial is the ability to start stabilizing andor growing kind of the residential book so at what point with the long end of the curve kind of ticking up would you be interested in putting that paper on the balance sheet philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp chris what do you think i mean you christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i mean philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp securities securities christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp look i think philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp will get a little more attractive hopefully right associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp we would hope so yeah and the resi mortgage book weve been sort of focused and if you look at this quarters yields for the fourth quarter the resi book had an effective yield of and thats probably a reasonable level for us to be adding to that book and certainly a much better yield relative to other security choices that might be available and it wouldnt require much of a backup in some products to get back to those levels so that would certainly be the level wed probably start to add some back to the balance sheet michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thank you i appreciate it operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please state your question kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi this is actually kelly motta on chris thanks so much for the questions most of what i had has been asked and answered already but maybe on liquidity and liquidity management weve heard that there from a lot of banks that theres still going to be a drag from an influx as ppp is forgiven and potentially we get more stimulus how should we be thinking about that over the course of and the size of the balance sheet thank you philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure ill take that chris sic kelly if you noticed the quarterly trend obviously we and everyone have been awash in liquidity but youll also notice that weve taken some actions to reduce that liquidity so we prepaid as you know in the third quarter the fhlb advance that took a significant amount of cash off the balance sheet and this past quarter we decided to go ahead and repay the fed ppp facility that took another billion off so weve done some significant things to improve ie reduce the amount of cash weve had now as the next round of stimulus rolls out and customers get ppp loans liquidity perhaps will build but well continue to look for opportunities to manage the cash on our balance sheet you want to add anything to that chris christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp no i think you covered it i think weve reduced that as phil alluded to not only the million of fhlb advances that we repaid in the third quarter but yearoveryear over billion so weve really put a lot of that when you look at the total yearoveryear deposits are up billion and we repaid billion of federal home loan bank and as phil alluded to another billion of ppp ph alone so we really sort of put the money out to offset other liabilities in an effective way kelly motta q
