associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well good afternoon everyone and welcome to our second quarter earnings call im andy harmening and im joined here today by chris niles our chief financial officer and pat ahern our chief credit officer id like to start things off by reflecting upon my first full year sharing highlights for the quarter and providing a quick update on our strategic initiatives from there chris will walk through an update on our funding and margins ph income statement trends and capital and then pat will follow up with an update on grants so last fall we announced a new digital forward growthfocused strategic plan built on associated bancs foundation of strong credit and expense management our strategic plan is already well into the execution phase and we are driving significant positive core operating leverage improving our roatce and transforming our systems to more efficiently serve our customers over time our plan called for us to grow middle market lending as youll see weve significantly grown and deepened our core existing middle market and small business relationships our plan called for us to expand our lending capabilities by adding higheryielding asset classes in assetbased lending equipment finance and auto finance all three of these verticals are now driving growth and our plan called for us to shift investment dollars from brick andmortar assets to digital platforms and we expect the first of these digital updates to be rolled out to our customers later this quarter but let me be clear while were excited to see these investments in growth and digital come to life we are also committed to sticking with the foundational principles that got us here our disciplined approach to credit and expense management taken together after a full four quarters on the job im even more impressed with the quality of the team and more convinced that were on track to deliver higher revenue growth continued positive operating leverage and improving value for our stakeholders now turning to the current environment in the most recent quarter while the macroeconomic environment has shifted over the past year here in our markets weve continued to see signs of strength unemployment levels remain at near alltime lows in wisconsin and minnesota our business customers remain upbeat in their outlooks and our core consumer households are proving financially resilient on the commercial side we hinted at improving commercial activity and upward line utilization trends back in the spring and that activity continued to ramp ph up throughout quarter by june line utilization reverted to prepandemic levels as our customers continued to grow and expand on the consumer front we saw steady activity as households purchased homes put their home equity to work and purchased ph autos all while keeping steady deposit balances these trends complemented by our selective additions of new rms and our continued expansion of our initiative verticals contributed to one of the strongest loan growth quarters in our companys history and importantly we accomplished this while growing pointtopoint deposits and seeing further improvements in credit we see this as a testament to the stability and resilience of our customers and markets but its also a clear indication that our initiatives are having an impact looking ahead there is no denying that there are significant question marks remaining in the economy the continuing war in ukraine covid lockdowns in china inflation and supply chain disruptions they all pose risks but our customer base remains strong and we feel that were very wellpositioned to support them with an expanding variety of products and services without stretching on credit our optimism stems from the fact that associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 were growing in our core markets with our core customers and are comfortable with our credit capital and liquidity outlook as we look to the back half of the year with that let me touch on a few highlights outlined on slide our second quarter results reflected robust loan growth expanding margins stable deposits and resilient credit trends through a combination of normalizing business trends a rampup of our initiatives and generally rising rates our revenues increased yearover year while expenses were held to just yearoveryear this drove a significant improvement in pretax pre provision income and another quarter of plus returns on tangible common equity we also continued to see improving credit dynamics throughout our portfolios in fact we had less than basis point of net chargeoffs for the quarter we also resolved several nonperforming asset situations and saw significant declines in nonaccrual asset levels throughout the quarter together these improving credit factors allowed us to absorb this quarters loan growth with zero net loan provision now let me give some more color around our commercial loan dynamics shifting to slide as we move past the halfway point in the uptick in line utilization has clearly been a driver of our balances on the left side our ppp runoff has been more than offset by new activity in line uptick fueled by general commercial originations cre expansion and growth from our new verticals average total commercial balances have grown strongly over the past quarter and line utilization has now reverted to prepandemic historical levels turning to slide while we are pleased with the rebound weve seen on the commercial side were also pleased to report growth in nearly every vertical the chart on the righthand side shows this diversified growth while general commercial led the growth for the quarter we also added significant balances in consumer commercial real estate and specialized portfolios and as you can see we have broadbased growth reflecting the strength of our franchise and the diversified impact of our strategic initiatives based on the robust trends weve just discussed were revising our fullyear loan targets higher on slide given the continued strength in our markets we now expect to end the year with approximately billion of outstanding core commercial loan balances this outlook includes expected further moderation on mortgage warehouse portfolio runoff and the runoff of our remaining ppp book we continue to drive progress in our new abl and equipment finance verticals with both teams adding new highquality balances to our books we remain confident in the teams ability to hit the million combined target weve set for the end of the year taken together we expect our total commercial book to end the year at approximately billion now turning to consumer lending we continue to be impressed with our auto teams ability to drive highquality balances that help diversify our loan book and while this team is relatively new to associated theyve been doing this for decades in a variety of economic environments without sacrificing on quality this makes the team a great fit for us from a risk mindset and cultural perspective and were confident were on track to hit our yearend targets we also continue to expect residential mortgage balances to remain relatively stable through the end of the year so to summarize the growth we saw in the second quarter is driven by the resilience of our core customers and the disciplined execution of our strategic plan and investments our results provide us optionality to pursue high quality riskaware lending across a diversified set of business lines without the need to stretch on credit in the current environment on slide we show a fivequarter trend of our ptpp income a year ago we drew a line in the sand and stated that million was a baseline that we would improve upon ptpp income has consistently performed above that associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 level in each subsequent quarter and we remain on track to deliver strong positive operating leverage throughout the remainder of so let me pause there im going to hand it over to chris niles our chief financial officer to provide a little more detail on our funding revenue and income statement trends for the quarter chris christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy turning to slide we recognized that having access to core customer deposits and other lowcost funding sources is more important than ever particularly as we look to fund growth on the asset side of the balance sheet thats why weve taken meaningful steps in recent years to grow our core customer deposit base while reducing our reliance on highercost wholesale funding sources as we sit here today weve started this rate cycle from a much better funding position than where we were in we expect to hold wholesale funding to approximately of total funding going forward despite recent macro volatility our core deposit customers have remained resilient while we typically would expect to see deposit outflows in the first half of the calendar year weve actually seen modest net deposit growth versus the prior quarter and yearend and our consumer and commercial mix has remained stable reflecting consistent balances by business segment over the last several quarters our consistent growth in lowcost deposit categories has resulted in a franchise with deposit costs well below peer medians given our profile we feel wellpositioned to control our deposit betas going forward slide highlights our asset sensitivity and our ability to manage funding costs in a rising rate cycle yeartodate weve seen a significant uptick in the average yields of most of our earning asset categories since the fourth quarter of last year earning asset yields have increased by basis points on average or roughly of the increase weve seen in average fed funds over the same period our assets are fundamentally positioned to participate with further rate increases on the liability side yeartodate interest earning liability costs have only increased by basis points or roughly of the move in average fed funds this reflects our ability to lag funding costs as rates rise and to capture margin in higher rate level environments this widening gap between rapidly rising asset yields and more moderately increasing liability costs is the core benefit of our structural assetsensitive profile slide highlights the resulting nim expansion that comes from this structural asset sensitivity and the related growth in net interest income that is derived from that profile our net interest margin expanded from in the month of march to for the month of june consistent with our quarterly expansion of basis points on an average on a dollar nii basis our growth in structural asset sensitivity provided a million lift to revenue in the quarter moving on to slide weve laid out several of the factors that give us confidence that were well positioned for the cycle ahead first as demonstrated during the second quarter associated is more asset sensitive today than we were heading into last cycle roughly of our commercial portfolio will reprice or reset within the year which boosts our oneyear cumulative repricing gap second as previously mentioned we work to improve the mix of lowcost core customer funding to liabilities since lowcost deposits have grown from less than half to more than twothirds of our total deposits this has also contributed to our increasing assetsensitive profile associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 we would also like to highlight that associated benefits from a highly granular deposit base relative to our peers this reflects our emphasis on building stable sticky household and small business relationships throughout our footprint bottom line we are structurally in a better place today than we were in the last cycle and were confident that were operating from a position of strength as we head into back half of this year we now expect the fed to raise shortterm rates by basis points at the july fomc meeting and potentially an additional basis points at each remaining fomc meeting later this year based on these assumptions and our loan growth expectations we now expect our full year net interest income to exceed million turning to slide weve highlighted some noninterest income trends while fee income continues to be a headwind for the industry we actually saw modest net growth versus the prior quarter and the same period last year in  increases in cardbased fees and other feebased revenues partially offset the anticipated reductions in mortgage banking and wealth management fees ill remind you that we expect to see fee income moderate beginning in the third quarter based on the implementation of the new ph od nss changes we announced last quarter we also expect commercial deposit account fees to move slightly lower as higher rates translate into higher ecrs with the expectation for continued rise in rates we also see mortgage banking revenue further moderating as we move through the back half of the year nonetheless we remain confident in our most recent full year noninterest income guidance and continue to expect total noninterest income of between million and million in moving on to slide second quarter expenses came in at million this represents a yearoveryear increase in expenses consistent with our prior guidance driven by higher revenues and controlled expenses our efficiency ratio continues to improve as i stated previously expect to continue to scale up investments in people and technology but remain committed to keeping expense growth below revenue growth taking all of our initiatives into consideration we are tightening our expense guidance for the full year we now expect full year noninterest expense to come in between million and million which is within our prior range moving on to capital slide we managed capital levels towards the lower end of our range as we supported customer loan growth during the quarter nonetheless given our enhanced profitability trends we fully expect tce will grow through yearend and we will end the year in a to range we also expect cet1 will end the year between and now let me turn it over to chief credit officer pat ahern to provide an update on credit patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks chris id like to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide weve utilized the moodys may baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the moodys baseline forecast remained fairly consistent with recent trends and assumes increasing fed rate actions and minimal covid impact following five consecutive quarters of net reserve releases we posted a net zero provision in  with less than basis point of net chargeoffs for the quarter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 our acll at june was flat from the prior quarter at million with additions for loan growth and economic factors fully offset by releases from declining npas and other credit improvements totaling approximately million our ratio of reserves to loans declined from to during the quarter turning to slide we highlight our quarterly credit trends overall credit metrics remained strong with continued improvement in nonperforming assets and nonaccrual loans as a positive indicator of the health of the portfolio as compared to  total nonperforming assets decreased by in  while nonaccrual loans decreased by of note our billion commercial and business lending book currently has under million of nonaccrual loans which equates to less than basis point we would also highlight that across our entire book delinquencies which are a leading indicator of potential problem loans were just basis points at quarterend shifting to slide we spent more than a decade bolstering the credit foundation of associated as you can see weve built a bank that is diversified and balanced with a discipline on culture and a focus on quality of note yeartodate our net chargeoffs audio gap zero and our total nonaccruals are down about onethird yearoveryear strong growth in the second quarter was driven by investing in our ph core business growing our core relationships and expanding our engagement with customer segments with which we are very familiar with that said we are fully aware of the warning signs in the economy and we remain stringent in both portfolio management as well as sensitizing underwriting to reflect rising interest rates elevated inflation supply chain disruption and labor costs to name a few economic concerns going forward we expect to adjust provision to reflect changes to risk grades economic conditions loan volumes and other indications of credit quality with that i will now hand it back to andy to share some closing thoughts andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks pat on slide we recap our updated full year guidance for first we remain bullish about quality loan growth over the back half of the year and were updating our outlook as a result specifically we now expect full year total commercial loan growth of approximately billion in we continue to expect full year auto finance growth of approximately billion we now anticipate a 75basispoint increase at this months fomc meeting and a 25basispoint increase at each remaining fomc meeting this year as such we expect our full year net interest income to exceed million we continue to expect total noninterest income of between million and million for the full year and taken together we now expect the combined total of net interest income and fee income to exceed billion lastly we remain committed to expense discipline and were tightening our noninterest expense guidance as a result we now expect between million and million of noninterest expense in associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 before we move to qa i want to acknowledge that this call marks chris niles last quarterly earnings call before he retires since joining associated in chris has had a tremendously positive impact on the company and has put us in an excellent position as we look to build on our strong foundation from here were looking forward to the addition of two experienced leaders to our executive leadership team bryan carson officially joined us earlier this week as our new chief product and marketing officer while derek meyer will be joining associated as our new cfo at the beginning of august as ive stated previously i believe we are making the cfo transition from a position of strength especially given our positive momentum in the first half of the year adding derek and bryan to the team will bolster our current growth strategy as we look to deepen relationships generate deposits and execute our digital transformation this will further drive associated forward on our path to value creation and despite the macro headwinds in the near term we are executing our strategy in real time and im confident our ability to deliver strong performance for our stakeholders now and in the years to come with that lets open it up for questions question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed with your question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon this is timur braziler filling in for jared andy i know youve been quite optimistic on the potential for loan growth but what we saw this quarter was pretty exceptional i guess were you surprised by the pace of the loan growth was there anything that was pulled forward from trying to get ahead of higher rates within that number and as you look at an optimistic second half of the year maybe talk through some of the industries and verticals where you think the majority of that incremental loan growth is going to be coming from andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah well thank you for the question first id say i wouldnt say that we were surprised what id say is we had every we had diversification of growth so we had growth in almost every single category as we look we did get a little tailwind on usage on commercial line utilization we dont expect that tailwind in the second half of the year you can see in our forecast we still expect very nice growth but nothing where youd take the second quarter and multiply it it starts to dampen just a little bit whether thats from an economy standpoint or our ability to be selective now that we have options on where we grow to try to drive value so we feel very good about what occurred and frankly when you transition your assets as we did as we took some nonperforming or some real estate assets and transition that into the rm ranks we were able to grow not expand our credit box and still get some quality loan growth across the board associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then as youre looking to fund future loan growth are there initiatives or visibility into incremental deposits coming online in the second half of the year to kind of supplement that growth or will you continue leaning on fhlbs to kind of bridge the gap andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah no with the growth that we expect in second half of the year we expect largely to be able to fund that vis àvis our deposit growth we have had a number of initiatives that weve been working on from our hsa to having our commercial rms focused on deposit acquisition to having our business banking rms focused on deposit acquisition to launching the massaffluent vertical in the last half of the year to work in digital account opening to having a focus on liquidity management or treasury management for our rms so we feel pretty good about being able to increase the trajectory of our loan growth weve demonstrated the ability on our deposit growth weve demonstrated that ability to execute on loan initiatives and im expecting that well be able to execute on the deposit initiatives as well but i will say structurally we do have the luxury of being different this time than in coming through that rate cycle right now we have reliance of about on wholesale network deposits versus six years ago where we had a reliance on those deposits so we do have the ability to borrow from the fhlb but our intent is to continue to drive core funding and with the path that were on we feel very good about meeting the deposit betas you can see we had a strong deposit beta coming through this quarter and our forecast is to for the year and we feel like with the mix were right in line to achieve that christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp and timur we would highlight also seasonally wed normally expect to lose deposits through the tax season that happened we saw a stepdown from march into april and then those balances basically held through the second quarter seasonally though we would also expect to generally see an uptick in the third quarter as we move towards the september and the funding cycle for municipal governments and the collection of property taxes later in the year thats historically been a net benefit and a tailwind for us and we have no reason to believe we wont see that this year as well timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good color thank you and then just lastly for me looking at some of the wholesale borrowing that was taken on it looks like balances increased while the cost of that actually declined can you talk through that dynamic was there some incremental duration that was added there yeah just any color on that decline in costs would be appreciated andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah we do have a little color we have a little color around that chris why dont you take that one associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure so in general two things specific to the federal home loan bank advances we did restructure some of our term advances as rates moved up we were able to exit those with no penalty no prepayment fee and moved those into a more advantageous funding profile second we also had the retirement and youll see that in sort of total cost of funds of our senior notes which obviously is flowing through now as a positive to the total wholesale funding costs timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you nice quarter and good luck chris in your retirement christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hi scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey just wanted to get kind of revisit funding a bit so i mean the funding profile theres no question its significantly better you guys have such strong loan growth thats outstripping deposits materially i guess youre sort of getting towards one of the higher loantodeposit ratios so like what kind of loantodeposit ratio do you target i imagine well get there fairly soon so thereafter whats the sort of the plan to fund the strong loan growth and understanding that loan growth overall will probably temper down a bit but just curious for your thoughts andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so ill start this chris if you want to jump in so ending the quarter around in loantodeposit ratio our expectation is that we have multiple areas that were going to be able to attract core deposits so largely wed like to keep that number between and which we expect and hope to do associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 if that is not possible as we know we have some ability to get wholesale funding but i would say just as the loan initiatives got going for us and the execution on that theres a clear path for liquidity management treasury management when you do that you get more commercial deposits from your customers there is a clarity for me when i see the numbers on mass affluent that were underpenetrated in our customer base this will be the third time that ive launched a massaffluent strategy so have a pretty clear indication that theres significant dollars available to us our account opening we will work on a new account opening on digital in the fourth quarter of the year that will only gain momentum as we go into yearend and the first quarter weve added resources on the hsa side of things that business starts to ramp up towards the end of the year and the first quarter so well continue to get balances there so while wed like to stay at the and below range we also think the deposit initiatives which weve been working on for quite some time will continue to kick in in the fourth quarter in the first quarter in the second quarter of next year as loan growth i think dampens i mean it was a very good quarter for us but it dampens r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp a little bit in second half of the year and the first half of next year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co got it christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp and scott the only thing i would add to that is if you look back at some of our prior earnings deck and investor decks we used to highlight the seasonal factors that drove our loantodeposit ratio r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp and the second quarter has historically been our peak loantodeposit ratio period and usually our fourth quarter is ph a low and so we have no reason to believe that some of those seasonal deposits arent going to swing the way they usually do and that will contribute to an improving profile there r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 okay perfect thanks andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp but even with wholesale funding we believe strongly we can hold the margins that we forecasted r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then i guess as we continue to go do you just sort of naturally become a little less assetsensitive than if the loan growth still get grip some things i mean its going to be great and i have trajectory here through the remainder of the year just trying to get a sense for what the rate sensitivity profile will look like as we go into next year andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah thats one of the things we really like is on the way up were very assetsensitive and you can see that that has worked to our benefit but the initiatives that we have are larger on the fixed rate side whether that be assetbased lending whether that be equipment finance whether that be auto lending so as were taking advantage of getting a peak in rates we expect that there is a dampening to asset sensitivity as we reach that peak and have a potential for a decrease in interest rates at some point in christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp scott i think internally weve sometimes discussed it as sort of the traditional bond portfolio laddering weve been laddering into higher rate fixed rate assets as the market has been moving higher and were going to be the beneficiary of that laddering up in this cycle here over the next couple of quarters and if the cycle turns will we have the benefit those are less prepaymentsensitive asset classes than our historical reliance on mortgage to play that part in our portfolio r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right well thank you guys very much for the color and again chris best wishes christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks scott operator our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw sic kbw please proceed with your question associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks chris maybe a question i think weve asked in the past what each basis points means i know were moving in chunks but weve all got different rate assumptions just trying to see if our rate forecast is a little bit different than yours and what the incremental benefit could be christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so as weve said its roughly million per month for each 25basispoint increment above our forecast so were calling for basis points here at the end of july thats baked in and basis points at each remaining meeting thats baked into the millionplus but to extent you had an extra basis points because it was basis points here in july or because one of the subsequent meetings ended up being basis points it would be million per month in the period following that rate increase christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks and then andy maybe one for you just a bigger picture question youve got a lot of momentum on the initiatives can you just remind us like the longterm targets roe roa efficiency obviously rates dictate a lot of that but just how youre thinking about levels and timing thanks christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure so i think maybe ill jump in initially we said were driving towards a margin over the near term in the month of june we got to so that feels like were going to be hitting that goal here pretty soon weve also said wed be driving towards a to efficiency ratio the fully taxequivalent efficiency ratio came in at so we feel like were moving in the right direction on that one and our adjusted efficiency ratio at just over is consistent with that move and finally wed say weve targeted midteens rotce on a consistent basis and we came in at again this quarter so i feel pretty confident that were on the right trajectory to get to a midteens level christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect thanks chris andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp chris i thought chris niles took the softball on that one by on the margin one at with a forecast of christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks again associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of daniel tamayo with raymond james please proceed with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good afternoon everybody i guess first just a clarification on the impact in the second quarter of the excess cash deployment obviously that was because of the tremendous loan growth you had in the quarter but are you able to strip out kind of the what the impact of the mix shift was on the margin relative to just the rate hike christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i think the way we think about it again roughly using that million per month the million per month we had previously guided to a benefit and obviously we saw more than that in the may and june action so those sort of stacked on top of each other drove a good portion of the outperformance but yes part of it was from cash utilization the balance sheet growth factor and the other part was from the rates but i think if you back out the million a month for the rate bumps you can solve for the residual which is sort of the balance effects daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then my second question is on the expense guidance the guidance assumes kind of a rampup in the back half of the year in terms of annualized growth from last year just curious how we should think about growth kind of in the fourth quarter or that base in the fourth quarter entering if the number should just flow freely into or do you think annualized expense growth once we get past the fourth quarter is a better way to look at it thanks andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp i would refer you back to our prior investor presentations where we said that over the horizon we expected to keep overall expense growth in that zone weve delivered this year our baseline is that were going to try and be disciplined about expenses going forward as well so were going to hit the range that weve given to you and were going to see expense growth next year we think itll be in line with our overall long term guidance and i would say that it is in a ramp up but in part its ramping up because a number of the technology initiatives that weve been working on for the last nine months are going to come into play and be put into service here and that will start amortizing through our expense base and weve still got hiring that were working our way through that is going to come online and have a fullyear effect thats going to roll into the third and fourth quarters so we continue to invest in technology we continue to invest in people those will bump the numbers but were growing revenues even faster and well be disciplined about how that grows christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp and what weve said before with regards to expenses wed only spend that money if were driving revenue and so we are hitting the revenue targets and exceeding them of course its a combination now of both growth and margin due to the accelerated rate environment what i would say though when we look at fourth quarter well try to do is well position ourselves as weve said wed do every single year to acknowledge that theres a change associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 in the industry theres a change in the marketplace and we will try to make strategic cuts to redeploy that expense back into the business so as we look at that in the fourth quarter we took action on real estate last year well look across whatever we think is a lessproducing asset and what we can put back into the revenue producing and the support groups and the technology initiatives that we have as a company daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc all right terrific i appreciate that color its exactly what i was looking for thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks daniel operator our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp good afternoon terry christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp afternoon terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc maybe the first question just to dig back into the expenses you continue to hire new teams theres the equipment finance team last week and so i guess just to be clear the fourth quarter expense run rate do you think thatll capture the team building the run rate or will there continue to be growth off that fourth quarter as you continue to kind of opportunistically add commercial lenders and build out those teams andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp therell continue to be puts and takes as we build the expense but we feel a lot of confidence that were still in that range that weve said i feel like the number for next year with our longterm forecasting is still in that range so weve been able to steadily build one of the other questions that weve been asked is are you committed to growing the same number of relationship managers and what i would say to that is weve had a lot of success bringing in talent and getting our own relationship managers productivity up and so we will be selective in who we bring in well bring in if theres a talented rm out there wed hire them i dont feel pressure to be at a to because we have the run rate that we need to hit our midterm targets associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 so theres no pressure on adding but now were in a position where we can decide where we add and make sure that we have the discipline around the expense approach and stay within those targets that we stated from the beginning terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then as a followup could you maybe comment on any market disruption in chicago or milwaukee which are two important markets for you and whether youve been able to capitalize on any of that in terms of talent or customers and what your strategy is given the window to possibly gain share thank you andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp weve been able to add new names weve gotten relationship managers from almost every major national and regional bank in our footprint so the answer is yes i believe weve been able to take advantage of that and we brought in some folks that have immediately come in and started producing and our existing group is bringing in new names as well so i feel very good about the core franchise in our footprint and bringing in relationships so the answer is yes we feel like weve been able to take advantage of some of the disruption but i feel very optimistic throughout the footprint weve added very talented players in our northeast wisconsin weve added folks in minneapolis weve added people key people in milwaukee and chicago christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp and terry the only thing ill add to that is when we look at our commercial and business loan portfolio quarter overquarter and we think about where do we add the most wisconsin illinois were at the top of the list when we think about the specific commercial banking little sub markets where we operate milwaukee chicago and minneapolis basically led the commercial banking pack thats exactly where we want to be thats exactly where were seeing the uptick and i think that speaks to the diversification of growth that we saw across the franchise terry mcevoy q analyst stephens

associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 thanks operator thank you our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp good afternoon jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc once youre gone chris were just going to ask derek to do the work for us but were going to have to wait for you indiscernible question on for pat we havent talked about credit at all i think because its so clean but on slide theres an up arrow for qualitative and economic factors in your reserving can you talk a little bit about that and what you have built in there in terms of some of your assumptions patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp well i think what we tried to capture there is just the unknowns that we talked about in the marketplace and obviously theres a lot of macroeconomic factors that are creating some uncertainty were not blind to that and we wanted to build that in and acknowledge that looking forward i think what were doing now theres nothing i wouldnt say theres any overarching issues or concerns being raised right now but theres clearly inflation continued supply chain rising interest rates these are all things that point toward potential recession risk and we wanted to be able to capture that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay that knocked out one of my questions in terms of not really seeing any stress but one other question i had was on auto can you just remind us of some of the risk management factors you built in on auto and then touch a little bit on pricing not being critical but it looks kind of flattish and im just curious what youre seeing on pricing and do you expect yields to rise there christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes i think slide jon has some of the core credit discipline factors around that and pat i think youve got ltv factors and fico factors and then ill jump in just on pricing to your comment yes weve seen pricing be relatively tight there we would expect that to rise broadly as rates overall rise so i would expect to see that drift higher as we move to the back half of the year but let me turn it back to pat for credit patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 yeah i think from a from a risk management standpoint were constantly watching the valuation of whats going on in the marketplace were reacting in terms of new applications and what were seeing to what trends may or may not be happening weve got a lot of internal monitoring processes in place to deal with not only customers that were lending to but also dealerships that were working with so were constantly monitoring and weve got a lot of internal scorecards that kind of give us leading indicators of whats going on there in that marketplace andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp jon if you remember we actually this is andy we actually bought this the legacy data customer information so that we had a balanced scorecard that was tested with the back test with customer information already so it wasnt a matter of us just using the go forward information to build our models and with that id tell you were prime and super prime were super jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it and then just one if i can squeeze in one more a kind of a nonfinancial question but you talked about bryan your new marketing and product officer what are you charging him with andy and what kind of goals would you set for somebody like that as you continue to try to grow the company thanks andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah yeah great question so bryan is somebody i know pretty well and what he is is he has a strength on the data analytics the customer insights and success in driving growth via understanding customer and differentiation on product he also led much of the digital sales work that we did on the consumer side of the bank so when you think about understanding what matters to people that switch on the marketing side when you think about building a product that matters and you think about doing that digitally to me thats where the industry is going on the consumer side of the business in particular but he also had awareness on the commercial side of the business and so when you marry the ability to understand liquidity and how to drive and capture customers with the ability to work with our new cfo who has expertise on liquidity management and fpa im really very excited about each one of them individually and im probably even more excited about the combination and how they work together jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it i appreciate that chris best of luck im looking at your age here and snl and youre younger than i am and i kind of wonder what im doing wrong and youre retiring but i just i do wish you the best of luck okay andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director
