next phase of success and continue our profitable growth trajectory i look forward to working with andy as he takes over and serving in an advisory capacity to support the company let me now turn to our first quarter results its almost trite to say that the past months have been unlike anything weve experienced before but during the first quarter of weve seen steadily increasing availability of covid19 vaccinations throughout our markets businesses have started to reopen and encouraged by these trends our frontline teams are back in front of clients and working directly with our customers weve also continued to invest in and deploy technologies to meet our customers banking needs when and where they need us with the economy showing signs of improvement credit dynamics have continued to improve across all of our portfolios our customers remain liquid continue to pay down their credit lines and are positioning themselves for the expected economic recovery later this year as we celebrate our 160th year as a company we see many signs of a strengthening economy in our markets the first quarters highlights are detailed on slide our first quarter earnings per share were up from the fourth quarter we saw a strong fee income trends in the first quarter mortgage banking income capital markets and wealth management all grew taken together this strength in fee income offset the impacts of libor compression and mortgage refinancing activity which weighed on our net interest margin we also continued to see record levels of checking account deposit inflows driven by additional government stimulus while this added liquidity also compressed margins we continued to grow our lowest cost deposits which accounted for of total deposits at the end of the quarter this liquidity positions us to meet what we expect will be rising loan demand later this year shifting to credit weve been very pleased with the rapidly improving credit environment in early which speaks to the strength of our markets in the upper midwest nonaccrual loans were down quarterover quarter while net chargeoffs fell to just million or down about from the fourth quarter we also posted a negative provision for the quarter together chargeoffs and the negative provision drove a net reserve release of million we finished the quarter with strong capital and repurchased million of common stock during  our tangible book value per share increased to as of the end of the month and all our capital ratios improved year overyear on slide weve provided a summary of our quarterly pretax preprovision income which has remained relatively flat quarteroverquarter adjusting for the branch and other sales activity the quarteroverquarter change is even flatter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 turning to slide we highlight changes in quarterly loan trends compared to the first quarter of average first quarter loans increased billion or on a sequential quarterend of period basis we saw solid growth in our specialty lending and construction portfolios along with renewed ppp activity however we continued to see liquiditydriven paydown activity impact our general commercial portfolio driven by lower line utilization similarly while mortgage warehouse and our own mortgage banking group benefited from the ongoing refi wave the same activity drove our residential mortgage and heloc balances lower during the quarter we continued to enjoy strong mortgage originations but as weve discussed previously weve been reluctant to add lowrate mortgages to our balance sheet looking forward we remain optimistic around loan growth going into the latter part of this year specifically on commercial real estate lending we expect construction lending to continue at a strong pace and to drive increasing average cre balances by to during in addition while we expect most of our outstanding ppp loans from rounds one and two to be paid off or forgiven during the first half of the year weve seen good traction on round three ppp activity where weve supported nearly customers as of today we expect round three originations to peak in  at about million in total we expect to have supported over small and mediumsized businesses with more than billion in loans we remain optimistic about commercial loan demand in the back half of the year and still expect fullyear commercial loan growth that is cre and ci combined excluding the ppp loans of approximately to with respect to residential mortgage we continue to expect balance contraction from the ongoing refinancing activity however we expect any revenue contraction will be offset by incremental mortgage banking fee income as we saw in  wed also like to update you on our new auto lending initiative were expanding our consumer lending platform to add indirect auto lending to our product set to date weve hired over people from keybank including all the senior leadership and expect to end the year with a total of to fulltime equivalent employees as we build out this business we expect to begin originating indirect auto paper by the fall with production of million or more in adding to and diversifying our total consumer portfolio we expect the portfolios net yields to exceed those in our residential mortgage book as we achieve scale we expect the indirect auto financials will be more or less run rate neutral by yearend with income derived from  loan volumes offsetting the ongoing costs we expect this business to be accretive in and of course beyond we aspire to grow our indirect auto outstandings into a multibillion dollar loan portfolio over time moving to slide we continue to see alltime record deposit levels for associated customers reflecting our ability to retain our core customers in a low rate and largely remote banking environment our retention rates have been improving now for seven years and reflecting more than half of attrition over that time period our customer interaction and call center survey data continues to suggest our customers have been well served despite the challenges posed by the pandemic im particularly excited to tell you that we are currently in first place and leading the upper midwest region in the jd power retail banking study and we expect to be recognized by jd power as number one for the upper midwest when final results are released next week these positive customer dynamics are reflected in the strong growth of first quarter average deposits which were up billion or over the first quarter of this growth reflects strong trends in our lowest cost deposit categories which grew by approximately billion from the same period a year ago while we continued to reduce higher cost network and time deposits by over billion associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 from a quarteroverquarter standpoint endofperiod noninterestbearing checking and savings were up million and million respectively from the fourth quarter driving our lowcost deposits to their highest levels ever at the end of the first quarter lowcost deposits accounted for approximately of our balances marked by steady growth in checking and savings categories specifically turning to slide six we had previously indicated that dollar net interest income would be reduced by day count libor and refinancing pressures during  and in fact first quarter net interest income was million down million from the fourth quarter as you can see from the chart on the right the most significant drop in our realized yields was in our residential mortgage portfolio which came down by basis points reflecting the impact of prepayments and refi activity on the books the declining asset yields were partially offset by continuing improvement on the interest expense side where the additional influx of lowcost customer deposits combined with lower levels of borrowing continued to drive our interest expense lower while the 10basispoint quarterly drop in margin was more than we had expected as we look forward we continue to expect our net interest margin to gradually expand over the course of the second through fourth quarters slide shows a breakdown of the specific factors that impacted net interest income in  as we indicated on the prior slide key factors for the quarter were mortgage refinancedriven impacts such as premium and origination cost amortization which depressed net interest income by approximately million for the quarter however these costs were offset by an increase in net mortgage banking income over the course of the quarter and we expect mortgage yields to rebound as the current refinance wave slows in  on the commercial side our liborbased loans were impacted by day count the libor rate compression in february and march and slower ppp forgiveness relative to  while these impacts played a significant role in  we expect them to moderate as we move through the year further we expect spreads to widen on our liborbased commercial loans as we continue to implement new libor floors into our new and renewing loans this will happen over time or in conjunction with other refinance repricing or credit actions including the anticipated migration to sofr or other indices later this year we also still have over million in consumer cds with weighted average rates above set to mature by the end of the third quarter given the first quarters margin current rates and ongoing refi activity were revising our margin outlook for the full year to to turning to slide first quarter noninterest income came on at million up over from the fourth quarter reflecting the positive side of the mortgage refinance wave expanding feebased revenues and strong capital markets activity as can be seen on the right side of this slide mortgage banking income was up million quarteroverquarter as we recovered much of the msr valuation we wrote down last year in the declining rate environment we anticipate  will reflect continued strength in mortgage banking income but we expect this activity to moderate as we move later into the year capital markets fees came in at million an increase of quarteroverquarter reflecting an active syndications and risk management market wealth management fees also increased slightly for the first quarter buoyed by strong equity markets we note that the sale of whitnell are closed on march and we still ended the quarter with over billion of assets under management and more than yearoveryear growth rate as a further positive weve seen increasing card activity and purchase levels throughout our customer base including record credit and debit card spend in the month of march we also recorded gains on the sale of associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 whitnell to rockefeller the further disposition of branches during the quarter and other investments which totaled nearly million given the above we are updating and increasing our fullyear fee income outlook by million to reflect noninterest income expectations of million to million in on slide we highlight our expenses the first quarter came in at million a slight increase from the fourth quarter personnel expenses rose by million for the quarter driven by increased compensation and incentives higher mortgage commission expense and the addition of the team we brought in to support our new indirect auto lending initiative as a partial offset other core expenses continued to trend lower driven by a reduction of expense following the sale of whitnell and an additional branch sale that closed during the quarter after combining the added expenses tied to compensation and incentives mortgage commissions and the indirect auto initiative were revising our initial fullyear expense outlook from approximately million to between million and million the allowance update is shown on slide we utilized the moodys march baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the moodys baseline forecast assumes additional stimulus a continuing low rate environment and widely available and effective covid vaccines following the net reserve release of million in the fourth quarter we posted a further net reserve release of an additional million in the first quarter of this net release was driven by gross reductions in our allowance for all of our core business units with a million gross reduction in our allowance related to our general commercial and business lending portfolio a million reduction in our cre allowance and a million reduction in retail lending as of march our total allowance was million down from million in the prior quarter similarly our ratio of reserves to loans declined to from during the quarter we expect the allowance for loans to drop back down to approximately cecl day one levels by the end of our quarterly credit trends are presented on slide potential problem loans nonaccrual loans and net charge offs all declined during the quarter our key covid commercial exposures also continued to decline notably oil and gas retail and restaurant exposures all declined year in the quarter after peaking at billion in the second quarter of our quarterly active loan deferrals have continued to decline and fell to a total of just million across all our core business units in the first quarter total deferrals now make up just basis points of total loans at quarterend weve continued to see positive trends here very pleased with where weve ended most customers who received deferrals have not needed additional assistance and have been able to resume making normal payments assuming the positive credit dynamics continue we would expect a very nominal net provision for the year as shown on slide our regulatory capital levels remain strong our common equity tier ratio increased basis points from the fourth quarter and has grown basis points from the first quarter of as we conserved capital in light of economic uncertainty well continue to target tce levels at or above and cet1 at or above and so on slide we recap our updated guidance for were revising our net interest margin guidance down to reflect the ongoing prepayment dynamics to reflect a fullyear margin of approximately to were revising our noninterest income guidance up by million reflecting our positive fee income trends we now expect the full year to come in between million and million we expect this additional strength in our fee businesses to outpace the downward pressure on the margin associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 were revising our expense guidance upward to approximately million to million driven by additional incentive and compensation expense additional mortgage commissions and additional personnel expense to support our new indirect auto initiative given the credit trends we continue to see and assuming the economy continues to perform positively as we generally expect we now believe that full year provision will be very nominal finally given higher levels of profitability we expect our annual tax rate to normalize in the to range assuming no change in the corporate tax rate with that id be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys thank you for taking the question and i guess before we get started so phil best of luck i will miss on the conference calls and best wishes in whatever you choose to do in the future philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah you bet first question just the sort of the nuance of the factors in the fee improvement i think just doing the math it looks like a lot of the improvement we kind of already captured it in the reported first quarter numbers just curious how you guys are thinking about the remainder of the year is there any sort of core improvement to the way youre thinking things will trend it certainly sounds like mortgage will stay strong at least through the second quarter but just sort of on a goforward basis curious how you guys are thinking about that fee momentum philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so mortgage banking is going to remain strong for a while as you said our capital markets business should continue to perform very well we think that consumer spending is going to drive debit and credit we already saw record levels and i would imagine were going to start breaking records month after month going forward we of course do think that were going to have significant loan demand in the back half and that will add some fee income as well so we feel very good about our noninterest income outlook which is why we raised that guidance by million for the year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 okay all right perfect thank you and just one on pardon me ppp do you guys have the remaining ppp fees from both last years rounds as well as the most recent round and how those would be sort of bifurcated christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes scott so those are presented on slide of the tables theres million at the end of the year roughly million from the first two rounds and million from the new round here in  r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect thank you guys very much appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of elan zanger with jefferies please proceed with your question q hey good afternoon and best of luck phil on the next chapter this is indiscernible for casey haire just wanted to touch on auto what kind of credit box are you looking at for this product maybe can you tell us a little bit about the fico and potential loss rates and i appreciate i think you mentioned million by the fourth quarter or in the fourth quarter as you build out to get to make this a several billion dollar item kind of what are you thinking for for this product philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so little early to give you that much specific detail yet i can tell you that given our own credit appetite that youre probably familiar with or casey is that were going to be operating in the higher credit quality area in the prime and nearprime zip code weve hired as i mentioned the team from keybank and weve also actually bought some of the intellectual property from keybank to be able to jumpstart this business and operate within what was their we think relatively conservative and successful credit box so more detail to come as we get this going we still have work to do on systems to be able to stand up the business but well give you updates as the year goes on as far as where were going to be next year probably a little too early to give you that information but well certainly share that as the year goes on q okay and separately just on capital youre still well above your cet1 ratio i guess whats holding you back from maybe doing a little bit bigger buybacks going forward philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well nothing is necessarily holding us back we have a significant authorization still remaining from the board and as you know we have a new ceo starting next week so how we implement future buybacks will be reviewed and as always we will be thoughtful about how we deploy that capital doing it in an opportunistic way and beyond that we also never tell anyone exactly when were going to do it associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 q okay fair thank you operator our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your question christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks for the question maybe chris for you im kind of interested in more on the outlook for nii and maybe i missed it but given the downward draft in margin i guess excluding the ppp how should we think about the trajectory of net interest income from current levels indiscernible christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes so we do think the quarterly nii has bottomed we do believe as i draw your attention to page the net interest walkforward dynamics we believe the mortgage refinancedriven dynamics will abate and turn from the strong negative they were this quarter to with the sort of decrease in premium amortization and origination cost amortization move to a better level we believe the commercial and business lending volumes will drive that to a more positive place obviously well have a few more days in future quarter day counts and we continue to believe we will manage the interest expense lower as we move through the year and you sort of bring that all together and we see a positive bridge to  and a further positive in particular bridge into  when we expect well see more of the loan growth particularly on the commercial side i would note that our commercial and business core customers are at decadelow line utilization levels and so what you have is a mix going on where our traditional core yield and spread customer base is at a low point and we think as we move certainly into the third and certainly into the fourth they will return to a more normal high borrowing levels maybe not normal immediately but they will start to normalize and that spread will start to reemerge which is what we typically would see during the recovery or expansion cycle christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great color thank you and on the provision just given where we i guess started how negative it was and the constructive comments i hate to parse words but nominal provision would suggest that theres a meaningful positive provisions and im just trying to get a sense of the element of conservatism philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well what i said was very nominal so look credit has improved dramatically and from cecl day one through the first two quarters we were ramping up our reserves youve seen us start to release now in the fourth quarter and the first quarter were getting remarkable outcomes in credits that we were concerned about stuff that we thought we had lost content in has been fully repaid weve seen that now twice just in the last month sizable credits so the provision is going to be very low how is that associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats fair and then can you just i probably have it in my notes but the day one cecl reserve what was that percentage i just dont have it in front of me christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yes its shown on page of our deck of christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks chris christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah operator and our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good afternoon philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc couple of followups just on the debit and credit spend what do the numbers look like in january and february versus march philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah we were up in march over february i believe on transaction volume and on dollar volume so a dramatic step up in march jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then you may have touched on it and i think i missed it but on slide the general commercial decline what was the driver there associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp its line utilization were sitting right now jon at about which is the lowest its ever been we would normally run in the mid so i mean if nothing else since things tend to revert back to where to the mean theres a significant amount of untapped outstandings there that i believe youre going to start to see come on pretty hard as we get into the later part of the year with the business activity that were seeing and the conversations were having with our customers around the upper midwest inventories are going to have to start to build receivables are going to start to be generated and that stuff is going to have to be financed so we do believe that line utilization alone is going to drive significant pickup in ci as we get into the year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i guess it ties to the next question the periodend noninterestbearing in savings and money market growth so much higher than your average is every bank has experienced it but do you expect that to come back down when the line utilization starts to pick up or do you expect this stuff to stick around for a while philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well a lot of its sitting in retail accounts of course with all the stimulus money that went out so i expect consumers will start to spend money and that those dollars will come down our commercial borrowers arent sitting on all that money its mostly out on the retail side jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then just a random one but you talked about the jd power ranking philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc where were you in the past i mean we dont have to go back to but what philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp we were kind of average i mean we were we did fine but we werent a standout on that measure and weve made huge efforts over the years to really become a customerfacing and customercentric organization and i have to tell you that on my last earnings call its kind of gratifying to be able to say that were going to be number one in the upper midwest for retail customer satisfaction jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i remember the first call i think it was january and its kind of a mess so this is something to be proud of phil for sure so well thanks for everything phil good luck associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you and it did snow a little here yesterday but we didnt have to plow or anything because it melted operator our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon and i remember that call in it was a mess to jons point and the banks significantly healthier today on your last call phil so enjoyed working with you philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc i guess just circling back on the indirect auto and i apologize my phone line broke up a little bit when you were talking about that business could you just run through i guess did you evaluate any other lending verticals or was this the team presented itself and you had an interest the incoming ceo his bank has a strong history in that business did that come into play and then just the last part the expenses and i appreciate the update will there be incremental expenses next year that we should contemplate as we model out philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes great questions probably little early for me to give you much guidance on expenses but i can tell you that and as we talked about we have built a conservative credit book here for many years which also is a relatively lowyielding credit book i mean those things obviously go hand in hand weve been looking for another asset class to enter that we were comfortable with that has higher yields attached to it and so we settled in on the indirect auto lending business because after home lending in its various forms and the credit card biz its the next asset class for consumers that makes a difference just based on the size of the market and the size of those purchases for the average household so we had actually settled on pursuing this business the keybank team presented itself fortuitously as we were thinking this through and so we went after that aggressively and all of that was underway actually before the board hired andy so its fortuitous but coincidental that hes coming from a bank that does have a large presence in the indirect auto space terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thats great that is it on my list thanks everyone thanks phil philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 thank you operator our next question comes from the line of michael young with truist please proceed with your question michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thanks for taking the question sorry for another followup on the indirect auto but first of all would that be a regional book and really kind of crosssell within the core customer base initially and then walked out further or how do you kind of look at that philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp actually our intention is to be active in originating this indirect auto paper from the northeast all the way through to our footprint so thats the initial footprint that were looking at and that lines up basically with the team that weve hired from key michael young q analyst truist securities inc right okay and then maybe just a philosophical question there weve seen a lot of banks exit that business or get out back when losses were a little higher a couple of years back and there were some worry or concern there so is there anything that you all view differently when you were kind of reviewing it whether it be a scale issue or cecl impacts anything like that that kind of led you to believe this was a good business to be in whereas others have kind of exited at different times philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah as i was describing to terry a moment ago we do feel the need to seek some asset classes with higher yield and something that could make a difference we think that conservatively and properly run this is a perfectly fine business that will generate appropriate rarocs but critical to making that decision was finding an experienced team with a proven track record of success to run it for us and thats what we were able to find with the keybank team if you think about the history of this bank expanding outside of its footprint into other areas for example our loan production offices that have focused on commercial real estate in places like dallas and michigan and ohio and other places we are always very careful to make sure that the most important aspect was find the right leadership team to run those operations with experience in those markets and its a different asset class than commercial real estate but the same philosophy applies here we have found a great senior leadership team and we have found they have the ability to bring along significant amount of the rest of their team with us so were not trying to as novices get into this business were bringing experienced people on to help us do that its also true that many of us here whether its myself or dave stein or others in previous organizations have been involved in the business so although i wouldnt certainly call any of us experts compared to the people that we brought on we have significant familiarity with it associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay and maybe one last one if i could sneak it in just on kind of the potential infrastructure bill you talked about the positivity and kind of outlook in commercial and i guess ramping production have you had a lot of just anecdotal conversations where people are getting prepared or ramping up supplies et cetera for that already or are people kind of taking a waitandsee approach philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp no our borrowers who are in that space for example we have a decentsized portfolio of heavy civil contractors that we run out of minneapolis theyre of course eager and willing and anxious to get going and were there to support them so yeah i mean our customers are gearing up i mean this is still its still conversation right now in dc we would certainly expect to see something happening and our customers expect it to happen as well michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay that is all for me thanks and congrats phil on your time philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you appreciate it operator our final question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hi guys just a couple of followups first so looking at the guidance i think it implies costs are going to actually come down from the first quarter run rate so are the auto buildout costs already embedded in there or like where are the i guess where are the savings coming from that would allow you to have down costs through the remainder of the year visàvis the firstquarter run rate philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure so weve already hired more than half of that team during the course of the first quarter so some of those costs are already in there and our guidance of course takes into account all of the costs for the rest of the year know that our first quarter expenses usually are a little bit higher just from compensation activity and incentive activity and such so yeah i mean at million to million its a little less than the million run rate but that would be not unexpected given the normal seasonal pattern of our expenses r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay good all right and then just on the margin guidance of to are we talking there a reported margin like including the impact of the ppp fees or are we thinking sort of off that sort of core base of ive estimated around or so excluding the ppp fees associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp so that includes christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp its fully loaded reported number r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thats great thank you guys very much philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks scott operator and with that this concludes our questionandanswer session and i would like to turn the call back over to mr flynn for closing remarks philip b flynn president chief executive officer director associated banccorp great well thank you and in closing i do want to thank the analysts and investors who are on the call for the trust youve placed in me over these years i know andy looks forward to talking with you all later as he gets on board and i certainly would expect that hell continue to carry on our tradition of investor transparency and accessibility so if you have any questions in the meantime give us a call call me until wednesday after that call niles and andy harmening thanks again for your interest in associated banc operator with that this concludes
