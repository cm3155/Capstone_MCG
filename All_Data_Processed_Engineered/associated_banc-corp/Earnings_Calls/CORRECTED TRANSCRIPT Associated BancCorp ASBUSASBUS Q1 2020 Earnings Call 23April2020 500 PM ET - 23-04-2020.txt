joining me today are chris niles our chief financial officer and pat ahern our chief credit officer as you can see from our materials associated continued to meet the needs of our customers grow and generate net profit during the first three months of the year we continue to benefit from a resilient core funding base a strong market presence and a high quality lending portfolio but ill start by discussing our response to the radically changed environment we are now experiencing the past two months were extraordinary let me highlight the actions weve taken to help our customers and protect our colleagues we closed our branch lobbies on march becoming one of the first banks to transition to drivethrough and by appointmentonly service our branch operations and it teams have responded wonderfully to meet the needs of our customers we began to send people to work remotely on march and now have about of our colleagues performing their jobs from home we are continuing to pay all of our colleagues including those whose jobs were curtailed by our social distancing measures we were also quick to offer our own covid19 relief program providing customers waivers of certain fees and deferrals of loan and mortgage payments through tuesday approximately primarily consumer and small business loan customers have been granted some form of payment or fee relief from a financial perspective we were ready to meet all of our customers needs with both lending availability and transactional liquidity as our core deposits increased even faster than loans our loantodeposit ratio strengthened during the quarter in addition since quarter end weve continued to support our small business customers through the sba paycheck protection program as of april we have funded nearly million of loans for more than businesses we are ready to support our customers in the second round of the ppp program and other programs that may come from the fed the treasury or the sba weve also continued to support our communities in these difficult times we continue to donate over million a year to support local housing programs food banks and other essential services in addition we recently donated to the united way and other local covid19 relief efforts in our footprint standing up new loan programs and processes while working remotely has been hard but weve met these challenges and stand ready to help our customers get through this difficult period so now let me turn to the financial results on slide our first quarter gaap earnings were per share driven by resilient net interest income and reduced expenses excluding first on the first staunton acquisitionrelated costs our earnings were per share we had a strong loan growth particularly in our commercial and business lending portfolio as customers drew on lines of credit for their own liquidity the line draws in turn drove increased deposits as customers built up cash positions the first staunton acquisition which closed on february also contributed to loan and core deposit growth our net interest margin increased basis point from the fourth quarter driven by a lower cost of funds and elevated libor rates the slightly higher margin coupled with loan growth resulted in a million increase in our pretax preprovision income from the fourth quarter our cet1 ratio was giving us ample capital to fund our commitments and support additional loan growth even after repurchasing million of common stock in the quarter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 we also implemented cecl as of january resulting in a onetime million increase to our allowance for credit losses and a first quarter provision of million reflecting our economic outlook going forward average loan balances are shown on slide total loan balances were up million from the fourth quarter as we saw increases in residential mortgages commercial and business lending and commercial real estate residential mortgage growth was driven by solid origination trends and lower payoffs in the first two months of the quarter while we anticipate payoffs to be elevated in the second quarter due to lower rates our pipeline continues to be strong weve taken about billion in mortgage applications this year through midapril which is about double the pace we saw over the same period last year growth in our commercial and business portfolio was driven by our power utilities vertical additionally general commercial lending and reits had strong growth in the quarter while customer drives in march contributed to the increase we also had strong pipeline production offsetting these gains were a seasonal decline in mortgage warehouse through much of the quarter and the purposeful runoff of our oil and gas portfolio we expect to continue the reduction of our oil and gas book as we pursue additional credit risk mitigation opportunities we also saw solid results from our focus on growing commercial real estate term debt particularly in january and february commercial real estate construction loans also increased as we funded construction loans in our pipeline turning to slide we show end of period loan trends which highlights activity we saw in march and april in mid march we began experiencing a significant uptick in general commercial lending as customers drew on lines of credit and built up cash we also had a large increase in mortgage warehouse loans as lower mortgage rates induced a refinancing wave in march in cre customers increased line draws and delayed payoffs in march and we expect cre balances to remain elevated through the rest of the year customer demands for liquidity and refinancing activity have subsided in april as shown in the righthand graph this chart also highlights the impact of our participation in the paycheck protection program that we further detail on slide we began taking applications for the ppp on april the first day it was offered by the sba standing up a new loan program is always difficult and this one was made more so by the tight timeline change in guidance and by working remotely through great effort and dedication of several hundred of our colleagues we created all the forms and processes and modified systems to support the program in a matter of days through april we had funded over customers for nearly million of loans representing about of the dollars and about of the loans that were applied for we have taken advantage of the feds ppp lending facility to fund these loans we expect our customers will begin applying for loan forgiveness in late june and anticipate a bulk of the loans will be forgiven during the third quarter with the expected extension of the ppp program we expect to fund the remaining applications we received representing an additional million of loans weve already taken all those applications through the process so that well be ready to get sba authorization as soon as their portal opens in turn we expect to access the funds ppp lending facility to fund these loans as well on march we initiated our covid19 relief program by offering loan deferrals and fee waivers to our business and consumer customers through april weve approved deferrals or modifications for over loans totaling approximately million which is about of our total loans the approved loans include associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 million or about of the commercial real estate book mostly driven by our hotel and retailoriented borrowers million or of our commercial and business lending book and million of residential and consumer loans we hold in our own portfolio additionally in the first days of our covid19 release program we waived or refunded in fees for consumers and small businesses we are pleased to be able to help relieve some of our customers financial stress and to be part of the economic solution to this crisis turning to slide the current environment has introduced new risks on slide weve laid out our exposures to several categories of commercial loans potentially impacted by covid19 and lower hydrocarbon prices these balances represent or billion of outstanding loans at the end of the first quarter weve increased portfolio monitoring activities across the bank and are proactively working with our borrowers to help them navigate the current environment our largest likely area of exposure representing nearly of the loan book is to retailers and shopping centers approximately million of the retailer category is in cre in addition we have approximately million loan to predominantly investmentgrade retaileroriented reits we continue to monitor our oil and gas portfolio which now accounts for less than of our loan book with demand disruptions pushing the cost of oil down dramatically weve set aside additional loan last reserves against our oil and gas portfolio during the first quarter while many of our customers have hedged their positions over the near term and it may take a while for losses to develop we expect a prolonged period of lower prices that will stress the industry our exposure to the hospitality industry is fairly limited with just over million of loans to hotels representing less than of total loans we also carry approximately million in loans to restaurants and other food service companies beyond that we have limited exposures with just one customer in each of the casino movie theater or fracking sand mining business turn to slide weve outlined the banks transition to cecl in the first quarter we implemented cecl leveraging moodys baseline forecasts at both the beginning and the end of the quarter our day allowance for credit losses adjustment came in at million which was reserved as of january the higher level of day one adoption relative to our prior guidance was largely driven by an increase in identified probable troubled debt restructurings in our oil and gas portfolio and the fracking sand mining company with respect to our provision for the quarter we leveraged the moodys march baseline forecast and identified additional probable tdrs in the oil and gas book given changes in price and the dynamics in the industry further in response to the overall economic environment we also added additional reserves for our key commercial loan exposures which we highlighted on the prior slide and bolstered our unfunded commitment provision by million these factors drove the majority of our million provision for the quarter our net  reserve build of million reflects the provision net of chargeoffs and changes in our cecl modeling along with the increased expected prepayments on mortgages in aggregate our total allowance for credit losses on loans was million at quarter end as compared to million at year end we believe this million reserve build a increase adequately reflects the life of loan risks in our portfolio given the economic outlook at march our current allowance levels also cover over of our potential losses as produced in our last internal severely adverse stress test scenario million of the reserve build was specific to our remaining oil and gas portfolio and we ended the quarter with an acll reserve of nearly against oil and gas our overall blended acll represents basis points of total loans with nearly set against our cre exposures and just under set against our predominantly first mortgage consumer loan portfolio associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 turning to slide prior to the outbreak of covid19 the credit environment remained benign outside of oil and gas given the sudden economic downturn in customer relief programs our credit metrics outside of oil and gas remained relatively steady during the quarter potential problem loans increased million to million driven by a few cre credits along with some additional oil and gas names nonaccrual loans saw an million uptick with million coming from oil and gas and the majority of the remaining increase attributed to general ci and residential mortgages net chargeoffs were million with about half coming from oil and gas and the rest in general ci to address the disruption brought on by covid19 the company has taken a proactive approach to monitor customers impacted loan officers have reached out to their customers to understand their capital and liquidity needs this outreach has been an essential component of the companys relief programs as we support our customers through this turbulent time along with our customer outreach weve undertaken a deep examination of our loan portfolio to identify industries with additional risk exposure we continue detailed monitoring of the specific industries in addition to the overall portfolio as we analyze delinquencies and deferrals as leading indicators of credit issues in this evolving environment turning to slide average deposits were up nearly million from the fourth quarter the average deposit balance growth was driven by the first staunton acquisition which added about million of deposits in mid february our endofperiod balances increased nearly billion including billion of lowcost demand and savings deposits that came later in the quarter as our customers still get cash these inflows resulted in a beneficial mix shift and lowcost deposits made up of our overall deposits at the end of the quarter turning to slide the inflow deposits has also enabled us to maintain strong liquidity our wholesale funding ratio has remained stable demonstrating our continuing ability to fund most of our loans with deposits while we expect to continue funding loans with deposits we have billion of wholesale funding available including billion of capacity of the fhlb in chicago these figures do not include the additional liquidity thats available to us through the feds ppp lending facility our loan to deposit ratio was well within our historical range which gives us the flexibility to maintain deposit pricing discipline and we expect to maintain this ratio below turn to slide our net interest income was million an increase of million from the previous quarter and our net interest margin was up basis point from the fourth quarter there were several factors that drove the modest increase in nii and nim on the asset side one month libor remains significantly elevated over fed fund rates particularly in march positively impacting cre and commercial and business lending yields this benefit was offset by a decrease in longterm interest rates resulting in elevated refinancing in the residential mortgage book and the payoff of higher coupon loans in march additionally this increased prepayment rate drove accelerated recognition of deferred origination costs further reducing our mortgage yield on the liability side our total interestbearing deposit cost decreased basis points as we reduced pricing across our full suite of deposit products total interestbearing liabilities decreased basis points aided by a beneficial mix shift toward low cost deposits and reduced wholesale funding costs these factors were most pronounced in march resulting in a nim for for that month looking ahead we expect the commercial loan yields will continue to benefit from elevated libor rates in april and at least somewhat into may we anticipate the libor fed funds spread will normalize later in as economic conditions become less uncertain we also expect our deposit costs to continue to decline in the second quarter as we benefit from ph cd runoff and a full quarter impact from our reduced pricing associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 but note that our monthtodate april cost of interestbearing deposits is already running at approximately basis points turning to slide first quarter noninterest income of million was up million from last quarter and up million year over year our insurance income was seasonally higher as we received property and casualty contingency fees in the quarter and our capital markets groups saw revenue lifts driven by market volatility we also benefited from million of gross mortgage banking revenue in the first quarter but that was partially offset by a million msr impairment resulting in million of net mortgage banking income however most other fee categories were soft during  due in part to our covid19 relief program and lower market levels impacting assets under management and investment activity these declines in other fee categories were largely offset by net gains realized on the further selldown of prepaymentsensitive mortgage backed securities moving to slide noninterest expense of million was down million from the fourth quarter this decrease was primarily due to lower personnel costs as we reduced expected incentive compensation had less hiring in response to the current environment and are seeing the benefits of the restructuring done in the fourth quarter business development and advertising costs were million lower during the quarter due to less business travel and the planned reduction of advertising spend technology costs also decreased million from the reduction of thirdparty consultants which took place at the end of last year turning to slide we look at our customer activity as youd expect branch traffic is down since the pandemic began with april branch transactions about lower than january we also saw a drop in atm transactions for the same time period as our customers increasingly chose to stay home however with the significant investments weve made in digital technology over the last several years our customers were able to shift their activity from our branches to online and mobile we saw an uptick in mobile sessions since january and an increase in the use of our indiscernible application which allows customers to open accounts online or from their mobile devices call center volume has also increased as we move communications with our customers into nonbranch channels as shown on slide our regulatory capital levels remain strong and we have sufficient capital to support further loan growth if our customers continue to seek liquidity cet1 was at the end of the first quarter and we anticipate it will build through the remainder of we repurchased million of common stock in the quarter but suspended our repurchase program on march we expect our repurchase program to remain suspended for the remainder of the year on slide we discuss our outlook given the extraordinary economic uncertainty our previous quantitative guidance should no longer be relied upon however wed like to provide more general expectations for the remainder of the year while we have ample liquidity and funding sources we expect to be able to fund loan growth with deposit growth and expect our loan to deposit ratio will remain under given the lack of attractive investments for our portfolio were now targeting an investmentstototal assets ratio of we expect our mortgage banking business to continue to do well but it will likely be offset by lower service charges as we provide relief to our customers well also face headwinds in wealth management due to lower market valuations associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 we often speak about cost as being one factor that we control we will continue our disciplined approach and expect our expense run rate for the rest of the year to be in line with that of the first quarter as mentioned we suspended our stock repurchase program on march and expect that will remain as suspended for the remainder of the year as we build capital with that id be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from casey haire from jefferies please proceed with your question casey haire q analyst jefferies llc sorry about that yeah thanks guys so i guess focusing first on the energy reserves to it sounds like you guys do present do you expect to prolong ph depressed pricing here can you just just give us a little bit more color there can we expect more more reserve build or do you feel like you have adequate reserves at philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp pat do you want to take that question patrick e ahern a executive vice president chief credit officer associated banccorp sure so i think in general time will tell what we end up doing as the year goes on we feel like were adequately reserved right now however with the kind of unprecedented environment were dealing with oil and gas were going to follow this closely as we get into the second quarter right now our oil and gas portfolio has been reduced almost from a year ago and as weve mentioned it now represents about less than of the total portfolio now the portfolio as it sits today is about oil to gas and we feel good about the fact that about of the portfolio is hedged for and almost hedged for we are just kind of starting into the spring redetermination season right now weve got about a third of our loans have been they have got results on that redetermination and were seeing some reductions in borrowing base of about almost to and our average loan commitments have been reduced by about so casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and on the indiscernible front i think you mentioned a deferral million apologies if i missed this in the script but is that still trending up or is that is that stabilized just getting some color on the pace there philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 there is there is more to come clearly those are the deferrals that weve already granted there are some more to come theyre not going to go at the same pace i wouldnt think that we saw over this past four weeks or so casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just a couple of followups on the nim the libor disconnect with fed funds it sounds like you guys expect that to sort of normalize i guess a little bit towards the end of this quarter just what is sort of baked into your guide just for the quarter here so we can just track that philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so clearly it was elevated in march it stepped down that delta which was north of basis points it stepped down to basis points and we have a stepping down the longterm average is closer to an eighth were not sure its going to get to an eighth necessarily much before the end of the year but we certainly would see it getting down into that much narrower range as we move to the end of the third quarter casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and just last one on the deposit costs at in march how much more room do you have going forward from that level philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp so we mentioned it fell into the in april and it will probably likely fall further slightly given the rollovers and other repricing dynamics that will contribute to that so it probably would be again less than it will be in the in the second quarter and falling and likely less than that in the third quarter unless the environment shifts patrick e ahern a executive vice president chief credit officer associated banccorp yeah we slashed our deposit pricing at the same time that the fed took their last big whack at rates and so youll see the full impact of that as we go through the quarter but even as early as we are today in the second quarter weve dropped another basis points overall casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay thanks very much operator and our next question comes from scott siefers from piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys thanks for taking the questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 patrick e ahern a executive vice president chief credit officer associated banccorp good afternoon scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey i guess first question i wanted to ask was on the reserve to total stress losses i think so you said which is obviously a pretty healthy number i guess if i ph back into what the reserve is relative to the last time you guys did publicly disclosed stress test it would have been closer to i mean also its very healthy but just curious if you guys can maybe walk through what has changed in either the portfolio complexion loss assumptions what have you that would allow that reserve to kind of look better these days philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure scott so i think you can do the math and then infer yes that our total stress losses in the severely adverse scenario from our last public disclosure to our last internal run did come down several hundred million dollars the drivers of that as pat mentioned a little bit in part were more than million reduction in the oil and gas book and then the general mix of our portfolio which has become more overall mortgagecentric which has a lower loss content in our models in general and the continued low levels of risky asset classes in the severe scenarios such as single family construction lending or ph forsale housing construction lending and condorelated activity now our models were obviously geared and tied to the realized outcomes of the prior results so what will be the outcomes next time can shift but based on the models that weve had those numbers as we continue to mix the portfolio away from those higher risk classes into steadier loan categories have moved the total expect loss potential loss down and obviously we moved the reserve up r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thats good color and i appreciate that and then just wanted to ask one question just on capital so common equity tier is still very solid and then i guess whats a little unique about the way this cycle seems to be panning out is whereas tce ratio was like the allimportant ratio last time around presumably this time its got to have much less weight given that youd get penalized on the tce for ppp loans but those are kind of invisible from the standpoint of regulatory ratios i guess in your guys mind how does the tce factor into your thinking in the way you sort of manage things this time around philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well weve always said that we wanted to keep it at about or above and as you recall as we were building toward cecl implementation it had run out so we expected cecl we had first staunton come in what we didnt expect is to have billion loans flow on to the balance sheet at the end of march so that took it down to the that you see but if you exclude the ppp loans that will be sitting here although they are completely funded by the fed it should creep up from here with ppp if you leave that in of course itll be lower r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 yeah philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp because well end up with weve got i mean we have funded as we sit here today we have about another in the queue give or take and weve opened up our inquiry page already in anticipation of congress and the president signing the extension so i dont know where itll end up itll be higher than where it is ph today r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you guys very much philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yes operator and our next question is from terry mcevoy from stephens please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks good afternoon first off i was wondering philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi indiscernible are you seeing i mean experiencing higher modification activity and drawdown activity among those commercial portfolios that you highlighted in the presentation today philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp the reits have drawn their backup lines as you as you know im just trying to get to that page indiscernible philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp page its page so yeah so the reits have drawn and kind of just general ci not necessarily called out on page terry has drawn some and of course we had a runup in mortgage warehouse but thats to be expected associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 patrick e ahern a executive vice president chief credit officer associated banccorp so terry i guess i would add and i apologize i was looking at page so to phils comments just now you can see the general commercial loans is where they draw and the mortgage warehouse and the reit thats all at the end of the quarter and since then which is what we tried to highlight on the right hand side of page we really havent seen incremental activity so the drawdown and liquiditydriven activity we saw in the last three weeks of march really abated when we moved past april and we really havent seen any further of that activity here in the second quarter terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then just as my followup question do you any sense for the average fee on your ppp loans it looks like youre kind of average size is skewed a little bit larger than others which could could impact that or would impact that fee philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah i think were figuring its 3plus weve got a lot of smaller stuff in the queue like a lot of banks i mean we process the loans on a firstcomefirstserve basis but a lot of larger companies with professional finance staffs were ready to go upfront so it tended to skew larger at the beginning and as we wound it down leading up to the money running out the loans tend to get much smaller and whats left in our queue and whats coming in now tends to be smaller as well so itll probably be like 3ish 3plus terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay that makes total sense great thank you operator and our next question is from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good afternoon guys philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hi jon patrick e ahern a executive vice president chief credit officer associated banccorp hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 back on slide just following up on terrys question its probably a good sign that you havent seen more line draws indiscernible but curious how long you expect some of those draws to hang around indiscernible those come back down any thoughts on that philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah we generally feel that that a lot of these draws were just companies wanting to ensure their liquidity in the face of turmoil so things havent calmed down yet theyve calmed down some all of the fed actions have certainly helped a lot in the capital markets so its very hard to predict whats going to happen but my guess would be that as this quarter rolls along and if things continue to stabilize youll probably see some of this money come back just because people wont necessarily feel like theyve got to be sitting on a ton of cash but again its a little hard to predict the fact that we didnt continue to get draws past quarter end to any great degree it feels like there was a little bit of window dressing going on for some of the folks who drew these funds jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then on slide its a good slide i havent seen cecl shown like this by category so i think i understand the movement and everybody but the two negative numbers assuming one is a length of loan and the other is prepaymentdriven but can you can you just kind of address those two so we understand that philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp you are correct terry in both cases so in the day cecl adoption the negative in the commercial and business lending excluding oil and gas is adjusting for the fact that we have tend to have considerably shorter loan terms a lot of 364day type facilities et cetera and therefore our day one adoption was a reduction in the allocation of reserve to those given the termbased nature of cecl and similarly but for different reasons as we move through the quarter and refinance rates fell and therefore prepayment rates expected prepayment rates increased the average life of the expected mortgages at the end of the quarter was and is expected to be shorter than it was at the beginning so that resulted in a net release in the mortgage line which is why you had a net negative reserve build jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc that helps and then the next one is this is just trying to get this out of you chris will be like trying to get the packers ph draft pick early tonight but second quarter loan loss provision what are you watching or kind of what are the nuances for associated what are the things that might be a little different about how you will look at and think through the level necessary in terms of your second quarter provision philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah it is going to be hard to get that and im on the packers board so i do know the ph draft pick i can tell you if you really want it jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc ph ticker associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp we need a indiscernible yeah obviously were going to be looking at well let me think about that so a lot like lets think about hotels almost all of thats been deferred now so thats probably not going to drive much in the second quarter a lot of our oil and gas build up we use the probable troubled debt restructuring concept which i dont think a lot of banks have used this much which was embedded cecl so if we go through continued redetermination periods and we see continued market deterioration in collateral positions you could end up with some more probable tdrs and see some build there what else will be watching obviously delinquencies and such that we havent deferred for one reason or another patrick e ahern a executive vice president chief credit officer associated banccorp and a change in the overall macro environment right so our view at the end of the quarter for cecl has a certain macroeconomic outlook and in our internal discussions that had a fairly high and robust level of recessionary outcomes 20pluspercent type or gdp type drops et cetera and its plausible that two and a half months from now that environment would either be perhaps to be perhaps different and more positive or possibly worst as we work our way there now i would remain optimistic and say im hoping that things get better for the country and for all of us in which case i think there is room that the economic outlook is a positive in addition to the realized outcomes in our portfolio either in oil and gas or hospitality or otherwise philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah and last thing i would say is it certainly is more likely than not that therell be a reserve build in the second quarter just given now the environment here in the second quarter the continued unemployment claims that we saw this morning et cetera but fortunately ppnr looks pretty strong at the moment so i think weve got plenty of other ammunition for that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay yeah thanks for the help i appreciate it philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah operator and our next question is from michael young with suntrust robinson humphrey please proceed with your question michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks for taking the question good evening i wanted to first ask just on kind of balance sheet management and growth from here how youre thinking about that are you sort of hesitant to go out and make associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 new loans to new customers at this point and really focus more internally and how would you look at maybe mortgage in this environment putting that on balance sheet versus selling philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so the first part your question michael we are absolutely here to support our customers needs and we are wellpositioned to do that well continue to do it the second piece we are generally in a position where were going to move the flow of mortgages and thats what were doing now off to fannie or whomever so were not putting a lot of mortgages on our balance sheet on purpose thats not necessarily because of the runups and loan outstandings a lot of it has to do with youre really not encouraged to the cecl methodology to build up a lot of mortgages on your own books so well be in the mode generally speaking of originating and selling those mortgages and retaining service which has pretty much been our standard model michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay so with higher prepayment ph speed maybe on the existing book on the would you expect i guess those to those balances to decline andor would you look to replace those to maintain i guess the overall weighting philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp no we yeah i would guess that our mix i mean our mix already shifted quite dramatically at the end of the first quarter so i think you could expect the mix of our loan book to be less mortgage more ci more cre as the year progresses so were not going to do anything extraordinary to maintain those mortgage balances because theyre being offset by other by growth in other categories and actually strategically we had talked about this before that we felt like our mortgage book was creeping up to a too high of a level against our overall loan book and as things have turned out thats changed rather more rapidly than we thought it would and itll probably continue to evolve at a much slower pace throughout the year michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks and one last one maybe just on loan to values i think thats something that a lot of other banks have brought up relative to their cre book and i guess trying to give confidence to investors that they dont see a lot of loss content there do you have any of that level of disclosure maybe by sector or anything like that philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure i think i think the number that youd be most interested in if you go back to the slide where you see our exposure to retailers which is our largest sector of interest the loan to values in the term book for retailers and most of it is termed its michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and would that be consistent thought with i guess other other areas would be higher maybe any any color associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 indiscernible philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well its going to depend yeah it would depend very much on the individual categories but on this on this page where we called out industries which have been impacted by covid19 which are of our total loan book almost of that is in the category i just just talked about obviously retail reits are a different animal because theyre all a basket of projects so the ltv there ph is to remain oil and gas is depends on their redeterminations and then the rest of the exposures get pretty limited in a hurry so we focused in on whats the ltv on these retaileroriented commercial real estate projects and it turns out its pretty reasonable michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thanks philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure operator operator instructions our next question is from chris mcgratty from kbw please proceed with your question christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp good afternoon chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey chris or phil so just looking at slide on the guidance on the on the fee income isolating the mortgage component can you provide a little more perspective on the magnitude of pressure from some of the actions youre taking to waive fees and also kind of the market impact on your wealth business philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp sure so i mean the issue with wealth asset management and we disclosed that number and you can see it on page wealth aum came down by more than from year end to the end of the first quarter so that will have a drag on those fees as we move through the year now some of those fees are on a lag so theyll basically take effect here in the second quarter based on the downdraft we saw in the first quarter so its going to be an impact with regard to the waivers and fee charges we partially disclosed that on the slide with the indiscernible we are doing for our customers and thats already over indiscernible and it will likely associated banccorp asb corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2020 become more as we continue through the quarter if thats earlier we would expect there to be probably additional requests for waivers and such over the course of the quarter and so that will likely increase christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp now there is the potential that a lot of this maybe all of it will be offset by the fees we ultimately collect from the ppp program depending on what those turn out to be i mean theyre likely to be somewhere in the range im guessing of million to million fees that of course we had in they werent even a figment of our imagination at the start of the year so that should offset im guessing quite a bit of our concern about wealth as well as some of the waivers patrick e ahern a executive vice president chief credit officer associated banccorp and just for clarity for geography those fees will show up in net interest income over the course of the next six months likely as soon the loans come off not in fees just for clarity christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah got it got it and maybe maybe one more if i could so obviously dividends are a big topic in europe and making a way to the us i mean youre payout ratio is not glaringly just thoughts on dividend sustainability given the sharp change in the macro a sure so ill give you the jamie dimon answer which is we fully expect to continue to pay our dividend we feel comfortable that we should be able to but if we end up in a severe prolonged recession you know almost anything is on the table for almost any company christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks operator and we have reached the end of our questionandanswer session and i will now turn the call back to philip flynn for closing remarks philip b flynn president chief
