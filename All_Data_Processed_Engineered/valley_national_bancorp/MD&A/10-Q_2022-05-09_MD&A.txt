including the risk factors section in part i item of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december critical accounting policies and estimates valleys accounting policies are fundamental to understanding managements discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations at march we identified our policies on the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical accounting policies because management has to make subjective andor complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions management has reviewed the application of these policies and estimates with the audit committee of valleys board of directors our critical accounting policies are described in detail in part ii item in valleys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december and there have

our acquisition activities impact of covid19 covid19 infection rates declined during the first quarter and consumer and business activities remained robust these factors combined with global supply chain disruptions labor shortages and other factors contributed to higher inflation in the us w e continue to monitor the impact of covid19 including the emergence of any new variants closely including its impact on our employees customers communities and results of operations and other government or federal reserve actions see the operating environment section of mda for more details the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act and additional legislation that followed including the consolidated appropriations act and the american rescue plan act of provided funding for the sbas paycheck protection program ppp and established rules for qualifying borrowers to receive loan forgiveness by the sba under this program valley extended a total of billion ppp loans under the program of which billion of these loans have received forgiveness from the sba as of march we had million of ppp loans still outstanding in response to the covid19 pandemic and its economic impact on certain customers and in accordance with provisions set forth by the cares act valley implemented shortterm loan modifications such as payment deferrals fee waivers extensions of repayment terms or delays in payment that are insignificant when requested by customers vall ey had million of outstanding loans remaining in their payment deferral period under shortterm modifications at march as compared to million at december quarterly results net income for the first quarter was million or per diluted common share as compared to million or per diluted common share for the first quarter the million increase in quarterly net income as compared to the same quarter one year ago was largely due to following changes a million increase in net interest income mainly due to i higher average loan balances driven by strong organic growth and loans acquired from the westchester bank holding corporation westchester on december ii higher average investment securities iii a continued customer shift to deposits without stated maturities and the runoff of higher cost time deposits iv lower average other borrowings driven by repayment of maturing fhlb advances partially offset by v an million decrease in ppp loan related interest and fees an million increase in noninterest income mainly due to a million increase in fee income related to derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial lending customers fees generated by dudley ventures our tax credit advisory subsidiary acquired in the fourth quarter partially offset by a decrease in net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and a million decrease in our provision for credit losses mostly due to lower expected loss rates for the commercial real estate portfolio partially offset by a million increase in noninterest expense mainly due to increases in salary and employee benefits net occupancy and equipment and professional and legal fees expense categories driven in part by our expansion of business operations due to acquisitions and targeted growth in our lending and technology teams as well as merger related expenses totaling million for the first quarter see the net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense and income taxes sections below for more details on the items above impacting our first quarter results operating environment during the first quarter real gross domestic product at an annual rate decre ased percent compared to a percent increase in the fourth quarter largely as a result of a slowdown in inventory restocking and trade household demand and fixed investment from businesses and households improved modestly despite an acceleration in overall prices in march the federal reserve raised the federal funds rate percent to a target range of percent to percent following its meeting in may the federal reserve raised the federal fund rate by another percent to a target range of percent to percent to tame building inflationary pressures further interest rate hikes are expected during the remainder of largely due to the federal reserves efforts to curtail the current high level of inflation which has reached a 40year high in addition the federal reserve slowed its purchase of treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities and the federal reserve indicated at its recent meeting that it expects to reduce its securities holdings starting in june as securities reach their maturities the 10year us treasury note yield ended the first quarter at percent basis points higher compared with december the spread between the and 10year us treasury note yields ended the first quarter at percent which is basis points lower as compared to december the industry reported that demand for most commercial loan products continued to increase during the first quarter the increase was broadbased across commercial real estate lending and loans to middle market firms our loan originations increased sharply across most products in the first quarter primarily driven by increases in commercial real estate loans however anticipated higher market interest rates persistent inflation the lingering impact of the pandemic on supply chains and business opportunities labor market conditions and fallout from the russiaukraine war among other factors add a high level of uncertainty to the future path of the us economy should economic conditions deteriorate causing business activity spending and investment to slow it would adversely impact the banks financial results as highlighted below in this mda loans total loans increased billion to billion at march from december despite a million decrease in commercial and industrial ppp loans our nonppp loan portfolio increased billion or percent on an annualized basis largely due to wellbalanced commercial loan production across our primary markets and an uptick in new residential mortgage loans originated for investment rather than sale see further details on our loan activities under the loan portfolio section below asset quality total nonperforming assets npas consisting of nonaccrual loans other real estate owned oreo and other repossessed assets decreased million to million at march as compared to december nonaccrual loans decreased million to million at march as compared to december partly due to lower commercial real estate nonaccruals reflecting one loan payoff partly offset by two loans which were moved to nonaccrual status in addition commercial and industrial along with residential mortgage nonaccrual loans decreased partly due to loan payoffs during the first quarter nonaccrual loans represented percent of total loans at march compared to percent at december total a ccruing past due loans ie loans past due days or more and still accruing interest increased million to million or percent of total loans at march as compared to million or percent of total loans at december commercial real estate loans past due to days and to days increased million and million respectively to million and million respectively at march as compared to december mainly due to two loans totaling million and million included in these respective delinquency categories at march commercial and industrial loans past due to days and days or more increased million and million respectively as compared to december mainly due to a few additional loans that are considered wellsecured and in the process of collection see further details in the nonperforming assets section below deposits and other borrowings overall average deposits increased by billion to billion for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter mostly due to increased quarterly average balances related to deposits assumed from westchester on december av erage noninterest bearing deposits savings now and money market deposits and time deposits represented approximately percent percent and percent of total deposits as of march respectively our mix of average deposits for the first quarter continued to shift away from higher cost time deposits to the nonmaturity deposit categories as compared to the fourth quarter the shift has been aided by normal cd maturities and our ability to increase commercial and retail nonmaturity deposits actual ending balances for deposits increased million to approximately billion at march from december largely due to increases of million and million in the nonmaturity noninterest bearing deposit and interest bearing deposit categories respectively mostly offset by a million decrease in time deposits the decrease in time deposits was driven by runoff of maturing retail cds with some continued migration to the more liquid deposit product categories total brokered deposits consisting of money market deposit accounts decreased approximately million to billion at march as compared to billion at december as our funding mix continued to shift to commercial and retail deposit customers while we believe the current operating environment will likely continue to be favorable for valleys deposit gathering initiatives we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain deposit levels at or near those reported at march the following table presents average shortterm and longterm borrowings for the three months ended march december and march three months ended march december march in

sold under repurchase agreements junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts total average shortterm borrowings decreased million during the first quarter as compared to the first quarter mostly due to our repayment of maturing fhlb advances funded with excess cash liquidity average longterm borrowings including junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts which are presented separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition decreased million from the first quarter largely due to the combination of prepayments of fhlb advances during the second quarter repayments at maturity of several fhlb advances and million of longterm repurchase agreements which matured during the third quarter partially offset by our issuance of million subordinated notes in the second quarter actual ending balances for shortterm borrowings decreased by million to million at march as compared to december largely due to normal repayments of maturing fhlb advances

net income as adjusted a included in losses gains on securities transactions net c merger related expenses are primarily within salary and employee benefits expense and professional and legal fees in addition to the items used to calculate net income as adjusted in the table above our net income is from time to time impacted by fluctuations in the level of net gains on sales of loans and swap fees recognized from commercial loan customer transactions these amounts can vary widely from period to period due to among other factors the amount of residential mortgage loans originated for sale loan

first quarter increased million as compared to the fourth quarter and increased million from the first quarter interest income on a tax equivalent basis in the first quarter increased thousand to million as compared to the fourth quarter the increase was mainly due to increases in average loans and taxable investments totaling billion and million respectively largely offset by a million decrease in ppp loan related interest and fees during the first quarter caused by the significant winddown of our remaining ppp loan portfolio over the last several quarters interest expense of million for the first quarter decreased million as compared to the fourth quarter as we reduced our cost of funding from deposits and borrowings average interest earning assets increased billion to billion for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter primarily due to strong organic loan growth over the 12month period ended march loans acquired from westchester on december purchases of taxable investment securities and higher interest bearing overnight funds due to fluctuations in the timing of loan and investment activity as well as deposit growth compared to the fourth quarter average interest earning assets increased by billion during the first quarter the increase was primarily driven by a billion increase in average loan balances due to continued organic loan growth mainly in the commercial and residential mortgage loan categories and loans acquired from westchester average interest bearing liabilities increased million to billion for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter mainly due to the general solid growth in commercial and retail customer deposits without stated maturities and million of interest bearing deposits assumed from westchester partially offset by repayments of other borrowings during the last 12month period as compared to the fourth quarter average interest bearing liabilities increased by million in the first quarter mainly due to continued growth in average nonmaturity deposits balances including supplemental growth from relatively new niche product efforts targeting cannabis companies and professional service firms partially offset by continued runoff of higher cost time deposits and lower utilization of shortterm fhlb advances as a funding source total average deposits including noninterest bearing deposits increased billion to billion for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter see additional information under deposits and other borrowings in the executive summary section above our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis of percent for the first quarter decreased by basis points and increased by basis points from percent and percent for the fourth quarter and first quarter respectively the yield on average interest earning assets decreased by basis points on a linked quarter basis mostly due to the lower yield on loans and two less days in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter the yield on average loans decreased by basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter largely due to the decrease in ppp loan related interest and fees the overall cost of average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter the decrease was mainly due to a basis point decrease in the cost of average longterm borrowings the continued runoff of maturing higher cost time deposits and the moderately lower cost of our average nonmaturity interest bearing deposits our cost of total average deposits was percent for the first quarter as compared to percent for the fourth quarter in march the federal reserve increased the federal funds target rate by percent to percent and projected as many as six more similar interest rate hikes during the remainder of higher levels of market interest rates would benefit certain interest earning assets on our balance sheet and likely provide us the opportunity to reinvest any excess cash including normal repayments of loans and investments at higher rates under this scenario we continue to anticipate a certain lag in higher funding costs given the current liquidity present in the us banking system based upon our estimates at march we anticipate net interest income for the full months of to be approximately to percent higher than reported net interest income in excluding the impact of our recent acquisition of bank leumi usa on april on may the federal reserve increased the federal funds target rate by percent to a range of percent to percent this increase was generally anticipated in the interest rate backdrop used to forecast our net interest income as of march and as such our

deposit accounts losses gains on securities transactions net fees from loan servicing gains on sales of loans net bank owned life insurance other total noninterest income trust and investment services income increased by million for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in mostly due to additional revenues generated by our new advisory firm dudley ventures llc specializing in the investment and management of tax credit investments which we acquired in october net losses on securities transactions of million for the three months ended march were mostly due to net trading losses including the fair value mark at march related to our trading municipal bond portfolio net gains on sales of loans for each period are comprised of both gains on sales of residential mortgages and the net change in the mark to market gains and losses on our loans originated for sale and carried at fair value at each period end net gains on sales of loans decreased million for the three months ended march as compared to the same period of mostly due to lower loan sales volume and spreads ie margin on individual loan sales during the first quarter we sold approximately million of residential mortgage loans as compared to million during the first quarter in addition the mark to market loss on loans held for sale carried at fair value resulted in net losses totaling million and million for the three months ended march and respectively our ability to generate net gains on sales of loans could continue to be challenged by a number of factors including increases in market interest rates lower customer demand and our potential decision to change the mix of loans originated for investment in our loan portfolio rather than sale see further discussion of our residential mortgage loan origination activity under the loan portfolio section of this mda below other noninterest income increased million for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in primarily due to higher fee income from derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial lending customers caused by a greater volume of transactions swap fee income totaled million and million

assurance that our swap fees will remain at the level reported for the first quarter noninterest expense noninterest expense increased million to million for the three months ended march as compared

net occupancy and equipment expense fdic insurance assessment amortization of other intangible assets professional and legal fees amortization of tax credit investments telecommunications expense other total noninterest expense salary and employee benefits expense increased million for the three months ended march as compared to the same period of primarily due to strategic increases in our headcount to enhance lending and operations including additions to staff due to the westchester acquisition increases in our branch compensation to preserve staffing and service levels and to keep pace with the increases in wage demand across the industry in addition salary and employee benefits expense included approximately million in merger expense primarily consisting of severance during the first quarter net occupancy and equipment expense increased million for the three months ended march as compared to the same period of mainly due to higher technology related expense and repair and maintenance costs amortization of other intangible assets decreased million f or the three months ended march as compared to the s ame period of mostly due to lower amortization expense on mortgage servicing rights during the first quarter the higher level of amortization expense was partly caused by the acceleration of loan prepayments from customer refinance activity partially offset by thousand of net recoveries of impairment charges on certain loan servicing rights see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information professional and legal fees increased million f or the three months ended march as compared to the same period of the increase was largely attributable to higher third party managed services expense increased consulting expense mainly related to technology transformation and new product initiatives and to a lesser extent merger related expenses of thousand duri ng the three months ended march other noninterest expense increased million f or the three months ended march as compared to the same period of the increase was largely due to higher data processing costs oreo expense meals and entertainment advertising and other incrementally higher operating expenses due to the expansion of our operations including the acquisition of westchester on december the first quarter also included million of merger related expenses efficiency ratio the efficiency ratio measures total noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus total noninterest income we believe this nongaap measure provides a meaningful comparison of our operational performance and facilitates investors assessments of business performance and trends in comparison to our peers in the banking industry our overall efficiency ratio and its comparability to some of our peers is negatively impacted primarily by the amortization of tax credit investments as well as infrequent charges within noninterest income and expense including

first quarter fourth quarter and first quarter respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter was mainly due to an increase in excess stock compensation benefit recognized within income tax expense for the period us gaap requires that any change in judgment or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period be recognized as a discrete event in the quarter in which it occurs rather than being recognized as a change in effective tax rate for the current year our adherence to these tax guidelines may result in volatile effective income tax rates in future quarterly and annual periods factors that could impact managements judgment include changes in income tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies based on the current information available we anticipate that our effective tax rate will range from percent to percent for business segments we have four business segments that we monitor and report on to manage our business operations these segments are consumer lending commercial lending investment management and corporate and other adjustments our reportable segments have been determined based upon valleys internal structure of operations and lines of business each business segment is reviewed routinely for its asset growth contribution to income before income taxes and return on average interest earning assets and impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount expenses related to the branch network all other components of retail banking along with the back office departments of the bank are allocated from the corporate and other adjustments segment to each of the other three business segments interest expense and internal transfer expense for general corporate expenses are allocated to each business segment utilizing a transfer pricing methodology which involves the allocation of operating and funding costs based on each segments respective mix of average earning assets andor liabilities outstanding for the period the financial reporting for each segment contains allocations and reporting in line with our operations which may not necessarily be comparable to any other financial institution the accounting for each segment includes internal accounting policies designed to measure consistent and reasonable financial reporting and may result in income and expense measurements that differ from amounts under us gaap furthermore changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data the following tables present the financial data for each business segment for the three months ended march and three months ended

average interest earning assets before tax na three months ended march consumer lending commercial lending investment management corporate and other adjustments total in thousands average interest earning assets income loss before income taxes annualized return on average interest earning assets before tax na see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details consumer lending this consumer lending segment represented percent of our loan portfolio at march and was mainly comprised of residential mortgage loans and automobile loans and to a lesser extent home equity loans secured personal lines of credit and other consumer loans including credit card loans the duration of the residential mortgage loan portfolio which represented percent of our loan portfolio at march is subject to movements in the market level of interest rates and forecasted prepayment speeds the weighted average life of the automobile loans representing percent of total loans at march is relatively unaffected by movements in the market level of interest rates however the average life may be impacted by new loans as a result of the availability of credit within the automobile marketplace and consumer demand for purchasing new or used automobiles the consumer lending segment also includes the wealth management and insurance services division comprised of trust asset management insurance and tax credit advisory services average interest earning assets in this segment increased million to billion for the three months ended march as compared to the first quarter the increase was largely due to solid new and refinanced residential mortgage loan volumes over the last 12month period as well as growth in automobile loans and secured personal lines of credit loans acquired from westchester on december did not materially impact this business segment income before income taxes generated by the consumer lending segmen t decreased million to million for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter largely due to a million increase in the provision for loan losses and a million increase in the internal transfer expense the negative impact of these items was partially offset by a million decrease in noninterest expense the increase in the provision for loan losses was mainly due to reserves related to residential loan growth and deterioration in our economic forecast in the first quarter from december and a negative credit provision in the first quarter caused by improvement in the economic forecast component of the reserves at march the higher internal transfer expense was mostly driven by general increases related to organic growth in our business noninterest expense was higher in the period partly due to the mark to market impact of mortgage banking derivatives see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our mortgage bank derivative activities the net interest margin on the consumer lending portfolio decreased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter mainly due to a basis point decrease in the yield on average loans partially offset by a basis point decrease in the costs associated with our funding sources the basis point decrease in loan yield was largely due to lower yielding new loan volumes and normal loan repayments over the last 12month period the decrease in our funding costs was mainly due to continued runoff of higher cost time deposits greater mix of noninterest bearing deposits and our ability to reprice most deposit products at lower interest rates see the executive summary and the net interest income sections above for more details on our net interest margin and funding sources commercial lending the commercial lending segment is comprised of floating rate and adjustable rate commercial and industrial loans and construction loans as well as fixed rate owner occupied and commercial real estate loans due to the portfolios interest rate characteristics commercial lending is valleys business segment that is most sensitive to movements in market interest rates commercial and industrial loans totaled approximately billion and represented percent of the total loan portfolio at march commercial real estate loans and construction loans totaled billion and represented percent of the total loan portfolio at march average interest earning assets in this segment increased approximately billion to billion for the three months ended march as compared to the first quarter mostly due to strong new organic loan originations primarily concentrated in the commercial real estate loan portfolio and acquired loans from westchester partially offset by runoff of commercial and industrial ppp loans due to sba loan forgiveness for the three months ended march income before income taxes for the commercial lending segment increased million to million as compared to the first quarter mainly driven by increases in both net interest income and noninterest income as well as a lower provision for loan losses partially offset by higher internal transfer expense net interest income for this segment increased million to million for the first quarter as compared to the same period in primarily due to additional income generated on higher average loans and lower funding costs noninterest income increased million to million for the three months ended march as compared to the first quarter mainly due to a million increase in swap fee income from derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial loan customers the provision for loan losses decreased by million mainly due to lower reserves in the commercial real estate loan category attributed primarily to lower loss rates as compared to march internal transfer expense increased million for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter due to general increases related to both organic and acquired growth in our business the net interest margin for this segment increased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter due to a basis point decrease in the cost of our funding sources which was largely offset by a basis point decrease in the yield on average loans i nvestment management the investment management segment generates a large portion of our income through investments in various types of securities and interestbearing deposits with other banks these investments are mainly comprised of fixed rate securities and depending on our liquid cash position federal funds sold and interestbearing deposits with banks primarily the federal reserve bank of new york as part of our assetliability management strategies the fixed rate investments are one of valleys least sensitive assets to changes in market interest rates however a portion of the investment portfolio is invested in shorterduration securities to maintain the overall asset sensitivity of our balance sheet see the assetliability management section below for further analysis average interest earning assets in this segment increased million during the first quarter as compared to the first quarter mainly due to increases in average investment securities and interest bearing deposits with banks totaling million and million respectively the higher average investment securities balance was mainly driven by purchases of residential mortgage backed securities classified as held to maturity funded largely funded by deposit growth over the last 12month period the increase in overnight investments and deposits with other banks was mostly due to fluctuations in the timing of loan and investment activity and excess cash liquidity resulting from the solid growth in commercial and retail customer deposits during the first quarter income before income taxes for the investment management segment increased million to million as compared to million for the first quarter the increase was mainly due to higher net interest income largely offset by an increase in internal transfer expense the increase in net interest income totaled million and was mostly driven by higher yields and average investment balances as well as lower cost of funding internal transfer expense increased million for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter the net interest margin for this segment increased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the same quarter in largely due to a basis point decrease in our cost of funding coupled with a basis point increase in the yield on average investments the increase in the yield on average investments as compared to the first quarter was largely driven by the higher amortization expense in the prior year caused in part by acceleration of principal repayments in the low interest rate environment corporate and other adjustments the amounts disclosed as corporate and other adjustments represent income and expense items not directly attributable to a specific segment including net gains and losses on available for sale and held to maturity securities transactions not reported in the investment management segment above interest expense related to subordinated notes amortization and impairment of tax credit investments as well as noncore items including merger expenses the corporate and other adjustments segment recognized pretax losses of million and million for the three months ended march and respectively the million increase in the pretax loss during the period was mainly driven by an increase in noninterest expense and to a much lesser extent lower noninterest income mostly offset by an increase in internal transfer income noninterest expense increased million to million during the three months ended march as compared to the same period a year ago largely due to increases in salaries and employee benefits expense and professional and legal fees for the three months ended march see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda the internal transfer income increased by million to million for the three months ended march as compared to the same period year ago mostly due to general increases related to our growth assetliability management interest rate sensitivity our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to the movement in interest rates our assetliability management committee is responsible for managing such risks and establishing policies that monitor and coordinate our sources and uses of funds assetliability management is a continuous process due to the constant change in interest rate risk factors in assessing the appropriate interest rate risk levels for us management weighs the potential benefit of each risk management activity within the desired parameters of liquidity capital levels and managements tolerance for exposure to income fluctuations many of the actions undertaken by management utilize fair value analysis and attempt to achieve consistent accounting and economic benefits for financial assets and their related funding sources we have predominantly focused on managing our interest rate risk by attempting to match the inherent risk and cash flows of financial assets and liabilities specifically management employs multiple risk management activities such as optimizing the level of new residential mortgage originations retained in our mortgage portfolio through increasing or decreasing loan sales in the secondary market product pricing levels the desired maturity levels for new originations the composition levels of both our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as several other risk management activities we use a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a 12month and 24month period the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumptions of certain assets and liabilities as of march the model assumes immediate changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the composition or size of the balance sheet or other future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk in the model the forecasted shape of the yield curve remains static as of march the impact of interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps is also included in the model our simulation model is based on market interest rates and prepayment speeds prevalent in the market as of march although the size of valleys balance sheet is forecasted to remain static as of march in our model the composition is adjusted to reflect new interest earning assets and funding originations coupled with rate spreads utilizing our actual originations during the first quarter the model also utilizes an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates at march the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the table below due to the frequency and timing of changes in interest rates and changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories overall our net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios we actively manage these cash flows in conjunction with our liability mix duration and interest rates to optimize the net interest income while structuring the balance sheet in response to actual or potential changes in interest rates additionally our net interest income is impacted by the level of competition within our marketplace competition can negatively impact the level of interest rates attainable on loans and increase the cost of deposits which may result in downward pressure on our net interest margin in future periods other factors including but not limited to the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows will impact our net interest income results and may increase or decrease the level of asset sensitivity of our balance sheet convexity is a measure of how the duration of a financial instrument changes as market interest rates change potential movements in the convexity of bonds held in our investment portfolio as well as the duration of the loan portfolio may have a positive or negative impact on our net interest income in varying interest rate environments as a result the increase or decrease in forecasted net interest income may not have a linear relationship to the results reflected in the table below management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income the following table reflects managements expectations of the change in our net interest income over the next month period considering the aforementioned assumptions while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this simulation model we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact than shown in the table below estimated change in future net interest income changes in interest rates dollar change percentage change in basis points in thousands as noted in the table above a basis point immediate increase in interest rates combined with a static balance sheet where the size mix and proportions of assets and liabilities remain unchanged is projected to increase net interest income over the next month period by percent management believes the interest rate sensitivity remains within an acceptable tolerance range at march however the level of net interest income sensitivity may increase or decrease in the future as a result of several factors including potential changes in our balance sheet strategies the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows liquidity and cash requirements bank liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due a banks liquidity reflects its ability to meet loan demand to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate opportunities in the marketplace liquidity management is carefully performed and routinely reported by our treasury department to two board committees among other actions treasury reviews historical funding requirements our current liquidity position sources and stability of funding marketability of assets options for attracting additional funds and anticipated future funding needs including the level of unfunded commitments our goal is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover current and potential funding requirements the bank has no required regulatory liquidity ratios to maintain however it adheres to an internal liquidity policy the current policy maintains that we may not have a ratio of loans to deposits in ex cess of percent or reliance on wholesale funding greater than percent of total funding the bank was in compliance with the foregoing policies at march valleys short and longterm cash requirements include contractual obligations under borrowings deposits payment related to leases capital expenditures and other purchase commitments in the ordinary course of operations the bank also enters into various financial obligations including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments management believes the bank has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its shortterm and longterm obligations as they come due by utilizing various cash resources described below on the asset side of the balance sheet the bank has numerous sources of liquid funds in the form of cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits with banks including the federal reserve bank of new york investment securities held to maturity that are maturing within days or would otherwise qualify as maturities if sold ie percent of original cost basis has been repaid investment securities classified as trading and available for sale loans held for sale and from time to time federal funds sold and receivables related to unsettled securities transactions total liquid assets were approximate ly billion representing percent of earning assets at march and billion representing percent of earning assets at december of the billion of liquid assets at march approximately million of various investment securities were pledged to counterparties to support our earning asset funding strategies we anticipate the receipt of approx imately million in principal payments from securities in the total investment portfolio at march over the next month period due to normally scheduled principal repayments and expected prepayments of certain securities primarily residential mortgagebacked securities additional liquidity is derived from scheduled loan payments of principal and interest as well as prepayments received loan principal payments from total loans and loans held for sale at march are projected in accordance with their scheduled contractual terms to be approximately billion over the next month period as a contingency plan for any liquidity constraints liquidity could also be derived from the sale of conforming residential mortgages from our loan portfolio or alleviated from the temporary curtail ment of lending activities on the liability side of the balance sheet we utilize multiple sources of funds to meet liquidity needs including retail and commercial deposits brokered and municipal deposits and shortterm and longterm borrowings our core deposit base which generally excludes fully insured brokered deposits and both retail and brokered certificates of deposit over thousand represents the largest of these sources average core deposits totaled approximately billion and billion for the three months ended march and for the year ended december respectively representing percent and percent of average earning assets for the respective periods the level of interest bearing deposits is affected by interest rates offered which is often influenced by our need for funds and the need to match the maturities of assets and liabilities additional funding may be provided through deposit gathering networks and in the form of federal funds purchased through our well established relationships with numerous banks while these lending lines are uncommitted management believes that the bank could borrow approximately billion from these banks on a collective basis the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb and has the ability to borrow from them in the form of fhlb advances secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral including but not limited to us government and agency mortgagebacked securities and a blanket assignment of qualifying first lien mortgage loans consisting of both residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans additionally valleys collateral pledged to the fhlb may be used to obtain municipal letters of credit muloc to collateralize certain municipal deposits held by valley at march valley had billion of mulocs outstanding for this purpose furthermore we can obtain overnight borrowings from the federal reserve bank of new york via the discount window as a contingency for additional liquidity at march our borrowing capacity under the federal reserve banks discount window was billion we also have access to other shortterm and longterm borrowing sources to support our asset base such as repos ie securities sold under agreements to repurchase shortterm borrowings consisting of fhlb advances repos and from time to time federal funds purchased decreased approximately million to million at march as compared to december largely due to normal repayments of fhlb advances partially offset by million of federal funds purchased at march corporation liquidity valleys recurring cash requirements primarily consist of dividends to preferred and common shareholders and interest expense on subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts as part of our ongoing assetliability management strategies valley could also use cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock under its share repurchase program or redeem its callable junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes valleys cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the bank projected cash flows from the bank are expected to be adequate to pay preferred and common dividends if declared and interest expense payable to subordinated note holders and capital trusts given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of the bank in addition to dividends received from the bank valley can satisfy its cash requirements by utilizing its own cash and potential new funds borrowed from outside sources or capital issuances valley also has the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarterly periods up to five years but not beyond the stated maturity dates and subject to other conditions investment securities portfolio as of march we had million million billion and billion in equity trading debt available for sale and held to maturity debt securities respectively the equity securities consisted of one publicly traded mutual fund cra investments and several other equity investments we have made in companies that develop new financial technologies and in a partnership that invests in such companies our cra and other equity investments are a mix of both publicly traded entities and privately held entities our trading debt securities portfolio wholly consists of investment grade municipal bonds the available for sale and held to maturity debt securities portfolios which comprise the majority of the securities we own include us treasury securities us government agency securities taxexempt and taxable issuances of states and political subdivisions residential mortgagebacked securities singleissuer trust preferred securities principally issued by bank holding companies and high quality corporate bonds among other securities our available for sale debt securities include securities such as bank issued and other corporate bonds as well as municipal special revenue bonds that may pose a higher risk of future impairment charges to us as a result of the uncertain economic environment and its potential negative effect on the future performance of the security issuers allowance for credit losses and impairment analysis available for sale debt securities available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly in assessing whether a credit loss exists we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded limited to the amount the fair value is less than amortized cost basis declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses such as declines due to changes in market interest rates are recorded through other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes we have evaluated all available for sale debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of march and december and determined that the declines in fair value were mainly attributable to changes in market volatility due to factors such as interest rates and spread factors but not attributable to credit quality or other factors based on a comparison of the present value of expected cash flows to the amortized cost management recognized no impairment charges during the three months ended march and the year ended december as a result there was no allowance for credit losses for available for sale debt securities at march and december held to maturity debt securities valley estimates the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party valley has a zero loss expectation for certain securities within the held to maturity portfolio including us treasury securities us agency securities residential mortgagebacked securities issued by ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac and collateralized municipal bonds to measure the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations valley estimates the expected credit losses using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party assumptions used in the model for pools of securities with common risk characteristics include the historical lifetime probability of default and severity of loss in the event of default with the model incorporating several economic cycles of loss history data to calculate expected credit losses given default at the individual security level held to maturity debt securities were carried net of an allowance for credit losses totaling approximately million at both march and december there were no net chargeoffs of held to maturity debt securities for the three months ended march and investment grades the investment grades in the table below reflect the most current independent analysis performed by third parties of each security as of the date presented and not necessarily the investment grades at the date of our purchase of the securities for many securities the rating agencies may not have performed an independent analysis of the tranches owned by us but rather an analysis of the entire investment pool for this and other reasons we believe the assigned investment grades may not accurately reflect the actual credit quality of each security and should not be viewed in isolation as a measure of the quality of our investment portfolio the following table presents the held to maturity and available for sale debt securities portfolios by investment grades at march march amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross

million and million of net unearned fees related to ppp loans at march and december respectively commercial and industrial loans decreased million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at march as compared to december mostly due to million of ppp loans that were forgiven ie repaid during the first quarter ppp loan forgiveness will likely continue to negatively impact our ability to grow total commercial and industrial loans during the second quarter nonppp commercial and industrial loans increased by million at march or percent on an annualized basis as compared to december mainly resulting from the solid new loan pipeline in most of our markets driven by several factors including direct calling efforts of our growing commercial lending team commercial real estate loans excluding construction loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at march from december reflecting solid organic growth across most of our geographic footprints construction loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at march from december largely due to a higher volume of advances on preexisting loan projects during the first quarter residential mortgage loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis during the first quarter mainly due to new loan activity in the purchased home market and to a lesser extent refinance loan volumes new and refinanced residential mortgage loans totaled million for the first quarter as compared to million and million for the fourth quarter and first quarter respectively florida originations totaled approximately million and represented percent of total originations of the total originations in the first quarter million of residential mortgage loans were originated for sale rather than held for investment as compared to million during the first quarter during the first quarter we retained over percent of the total residential mortgages originations in our held for investment loan portfolio we sold approximately million of residential mortgage loans held for sale during the first quarter while we retained a higher percentage of new loan volumes during the first quarter we may continue to sell a large portion of our loan originations during the second quarter based upon normal management of the interest rate risk and mix of the interest earning assets on our balance sheet additionally refinanced loan applications have decreased significantly in the early stages of the second quarter due to the recent increase in mortgage interest rates and may challenge our ability to grow this loan category home equity loans decreased by million to million at march compared to december new home equity loan volumes and customer usage of existing home equity lines of credit continue to be modest and may be further challenged by a less favorable rising interest rate environment automobile loans decreased by million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at march as compared to december as loan repayments outpaced origination volumes in the first quarter car manufacturers have continued to struggle with low inventories of new vehicles caused by supply chain disruptions which have slowed auto production we originat ed million in auto loans through our dealership network during the first quarter as compared to million in the fourth quarter of the total originations our florida dealership network contributed million in auto loan originations representing approximately percent of new loans during the first quarter the current low levels of new and used automobile inventories may continue to negatively impact our auto loan growth during the second quarter other consumer loans decreased million to million at march as compared to billion at december most of our lendin g is in northern and central new jersey new york city long island florida and alabama except for smaller auto and residential mortgage loan portfolios derived from other neighboring states of new jersey to mitigate our geographic risks we make efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to guard against a potential downward turn in any one economic sector for the remainder of we anticipate strong organic commercial and industrial nonppp and commercial real estate loan growth in the early stages of the second quarter we are encouraged that our commercial loan origination pipelines remain robust and overall loan growth should remain welldiversified across our markets in our commercial loan categories due to the exceptional growth generated in the first quarter and an improved outlook for the rest of the year we currently project that our organic loan growth will range from to percent for the full year of excluding the impact of our recent acquisition of bank leumi usa on april however there can be no assurance that those positive trends will continue or balances will not decline from march given the uncertainty in the us economy due to several factors including the russiaukraine war persistently high inflation and the impact of the federal reserves monetary policy actions nonperforming assets nonperforming assets npa include nonaccrual loans other real estate owned oreo and other repossessed assets which primarily consists of automobiles and taxi medallions at march loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal or interest exceptions to the nonaccrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection oreo is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate oreo and other repossessed assets are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell our npas decreased million to million at march as compared to december largely due to loan payoffs net of new nonaccrual loans in several categories during the first quarter npas as a percentage of total loans and npas totaled percent and percent at march and december respectively as shown in the table below we believe our total npas has remained relatively low as a percentage of the total loan portfolio and the level of npas is reflective of our consistent approach to the loan underwriting criteria for both valley originated loans and loans purchased from third parties for additional details see the credit quality indicators section in note to the consolidated financial statements our lending strategy is based on underwriting standards designed to maintain high credit quality and we remain optimistic regarding the overall future performance of our loan portfolio during and the first quarter our overall credit trends remained stable and our business and borrowers continued to demonstrate resilience and growth despite the continuing challenges of the covid19 pandemic however management cannot provide assurance that the nonperforming assets will not increase substantially from the levels reported at march due to the continuing economic uncertainty and potential for credit deterioration in addition a few borrowers are still performing under forbearance agreements at march as discussed under the loan forbearance section below the following table sets forth by loan category accruing past due and nonperforming assets at the dates indicated in conjunction with our

included in this delinquency category at march loans past due to days increased million to million at march as compared to december commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans within this delinquency category increased million and million respectively at march mainly due to a few additional loans that are considered wellsecured and in the process of collection reported at march loans past due days or more and still accruing interest increased million to million at march as compared to december the increase was mainly driven by a million increase in commercial and industrial loans category as well as a moderate increase in residential mortgage delinquencies all of the loans past due days or more and still accruing interest reported at march are considered to be wellsecured and in the process of collection nonaccrual loans decreased million to million at march as compared to million at december mostly due to decreases of million and million in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans respectively the decrease in commercial real estate loans delinquencies was due in part to the full repayment of a million loan during the first quarter partly offset by two new nonaccrual loans at march the decrease in nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans was also partly due to loan payoffs during the first quarter nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans totaled million at march and largely consist of nonperforming new york city and chicago taxi medallion loans totaling million and thousand respectively at march the taxi medallion loans had related reserves of million or percent of such loans the tax medallion loans and related reserves remained relatively unchanged from december potential declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions and the stressed operating environment mainly within new york city due to the covid19 pandemic could negatively impact the future performance of this portfolio for example a percent decline in our current estimated market value of the taxi medallions would require additional allocated reserves of million within the allow ance for loan losses based upon the taxi medallion loan balances at march see the allowance for credit losses section below for further details on our reserves oreo properties totaled million at march and declined million as compared to december net gains

a premodification weighted average interest rate of percent loan forbearance in response to the c ovid19 pandemic and its economic impact on certain customers valley implemented shortterm loan modifications such as payment deferrals fee waivers extensions of repayment terms or delays in payment when requested by customers generally the modification terms allow for a deferral of payments for up to days which valley could extend for an additional days any extensions beyond this period were provided in accordance with applicable regulatory guidance und er the applicable accounting and regulatory guidance none of these loans were classified as tdrs at march and december vall ey had million of outstanding loans remaining in their payment deferral periods under shortterm modifications at march as compared to million at december allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses acl for loans includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments under cecl our methodology to establish the allowance for loan losses has two basic components a collective reserve component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics and an individual reserve component for loans that do not share risk characteristics consisting of collateral dependent tdr and expected tdr loans valley also maintains a separate allowance for unfunded credit commitments mainly consisting of undisbursed noncancellable lines of credit new loan commitments and commercial standby letters of credit valley estimated the collective acl using a current expected credit losses methodology which is based on relevant information about historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the loan balances in estimating the component of the allowance on a collective basis we use a transition matrix model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan pool by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics the metrics are based on the migration of loans from performing to loss by credit quality rating or delinquency categories using historical lifeofloan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool and the severity of loss based on the aggregate net lifetime losses the models expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative factors among other things these adjustments include and account for differences in i the impact of the reasonable and supportable economic forecast relative probability weightings and reversion period ii other asset specific risks to the extent they do not exist in the historical loss information and iii net expected recoveries of charged off loan balances these adjustments are based on qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses the expected lifetime loss rate is the life of loan loss percentage from the transition matrix model plus the impact of the adjustments for qualitative factors the expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the models expected lifetime loss rate by the exposure at default at period end on an undiscounted basis valley utilizes a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a oneyear period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the loan on a straightline basis the forecasts consist of a multiscenario economic forecast model to estimate future credit losses and is governed by a crossfunctional committee the committee meets each quarter to determine which economic scenarios developed by moodys will be incorporated into the model as well as the relative probability weightings of the selected scenarios based upon all readily available information the model projects economic variables under each scenario based on detailed statistical analyses we have identified and selected key variables that most closely correlated to our historical credit performance which include gdp unemployment and the caseshiller home price index for the first quarter we incorporated a probability weighted threescenario economic forecast including moodys baseline s3 and s4 scenarios at march valley maintained the majority of its probability weighting to the moodys baseline scenario with less emphasis on the s3 downside and s4 most adverse scenarios the baseline weighting reflects a positive economic outlook including higher gdp growth and lower unemployment levels that are expected to improve labor market conditions and promote stronger economic growth during during the first quarter we removed our modest weighting to the moodys s1 upside scenario used at december and added weighting to the s4 adverse scenario due to the greater uncertainty caused by recent developments including but not limited to persistently high inflation the federal reserves monetary policy actions the russiaukraine war and the unknown impact of economic sanctions on russia that may further negatively impact the supply chain in the us and abroad at march the moodys baseline forecast included the following specific assumptions gdp expansion by over percent in the second quarter unemployment of percent in the second quarter and improving to percent over the remainder of the forecast period ending in the first quarter and strong us economic growth driven by continued consumer spending see more details regarding our allowance
