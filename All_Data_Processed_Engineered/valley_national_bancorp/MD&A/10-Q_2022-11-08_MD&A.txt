performance or achievements critical accounting policies and estimates valleys accounting policies are fundamental to understanding managements discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations at september we identified our policies on the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical accounting policies because management has to make subjective andor complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions management has reviewed the application of these policies and estimates with the audit committee of valleys board of directors our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in detail in part ii item in valleys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december and there have been no material changes in such policies and estimates since the date of such report new authoritative accounting guidance see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new authoritative accounting guidance including the

consolidation activity we have significantly grown both in asset size and locations over the past several years both through organic efforts and bank acquisitions our most recent bank acquisition is discussed below bank leumi leisrael corporation on april valley completed its acquisition of bank leumi leisrael corporation the us subsidiary of bank leumi leisrael bm and parent company of bank leumi usa collectively referred to as bank leumi usa at the acquisition date bank leumi usa had approximately billion in assets billion of loans and billion of deposits after purchase accounting adjustments valley issued approximately million shares of common stock and paid million in cash in the transaction the consideration for the acquisition totaled approximately billion inclusive of the value of stock options the transaction resulted in million of goodwill and million of combined core deposit and other intangible assets subject to amortization see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the acquisition of bank leumi usa and other recent acquisition activities impact of covid19 during the third quarter worldwide inflationary concerns continued to outweigh the other negative impacts of covid19 among other factors chinas zero covid policy has created disruption of chinas manufacturing industry which could have prolonged negative consequences for the global economy as china exports up to onethird of the worlds intermediate goods w e continue to monitor the impact of covid19 including the emergence of new variants closely including its impact on our employees customers communities and results of operations and other government or federal reserve actions see the operating environment section of mda for more details the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act and additional legislation that followed including the consolidated appropriations act and the american rescue plan act of provided funding for the sbas paycheck protection program ppp and established rules for qualifying borrowers to receive loan forgiveness by the sba under this program valley extended a total of billion ppp loans under the program of wh ich billion have received forgiveness from the sba as of september we had million includi ng mi llion acquired from bank leumi usa of ppp loans still outstanding quarterly results net income for the third quarter was million or per diluted common share as compared to million or per diluted common share for the third quarter the million increase in quarterly net income as compared to the same quarter one year ago was mainly due to the following changes a million increase in net interest income mainly due to higher average loan balances driven by both acquired and organic loan volumes and increased yields on new and adjustablerate loans a million increase in noninterest income primarily driven by increases in wealth management and trust fees service charges on deposit accounts and other income totaling million million and million respectively related to additional income resulting from the bank leumi usa acquisition partially offset by lower net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and a million decrease in our provision for credit losses partially offset by an million increase in noninterest expense largely due to increases in salary and employee benefits technology furniture and equipment expenses and net occupancy caused by our expanded banking operations resulting from the acquisitions of bank leumi usa on april and the westchester bank holding corporation westchester on december and a million increase in income tax expense mostly due to higher pretax income in the third quarter see the net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense and income taxes sections below for more details on the impact of the items above on our third quarter results operating environment during the third quarter of real gross domestic product increased percent compared to a decline of percent in the second quarter of the increase in economic activity was driven in large part by household spending on goods and services and a favorable mix of export activity outpacing imports residential fixed investments declined as mortgage rates increased markedly which weighed on the headline result business fixed investment inventory restocking and government spending increased at a tepid rate during the third quarter the federal reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points to a target range of percent to percent at the end of the third quarter following its meeting in november the federal reserve raised the federal fund rate by another basis points to a target range of percent to percent in addition the federal reserve has continued to reduce its holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and mortgagebacked securities consistent with its previously announced plan the federal reserve targeted a reduction of its treasury and agency securities portfolio by billion per month through september and effective september raised its target reduction of securities to billion per month these actions reflect the federal reserves strong commitment to returning inflation to its percent objective the 10year us treasury note yield ended the third quarter of at percent basis points higher compared to june the spread between the and 10year us treasury note yields ended the quarter at negative percent a basis point decline from june for all commercial banks in the us loans and leases increased approximately percent from june to september while loan growth moderated somewhat during the quarter survey data from the industry reported that demand for most commercial and industrial loan products increased alternatively demand for most real estate related loans declined particularly for commercial real estate loans with construction and land development purposes during the third quarter valleys new loan originations decreased across most product types as compared to the second quarter but loan growth remained at robust levels partly due to slower paydowns on existing loans due to the rising market interest rate environment while confident in our commercial loan pipelines we expect a more challenging overall loan origination environment moving forward especially in the residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios due to the impact of higher market interest rates on customer demand and selective tightening of certain underwriting standards by valley further expected increases in market interest rates persistently high inflation the lingering impact of supply chain issues tight labor market conditions and global economic fallout from the russiaukraine war among other factors has added a higher level of uncertainty to the future path of the us economy and an elevated risk of a recession should economic conditions deteriorate causing business activity spending and investment to decline it would adversely impact our financial results as highlighted below in this mda loans total loans increased billion to billion at september from june primarily due to strong organic loan growth our loan portfolio increased percent on an annualized basis during the third quarter from the second quarter as a result of solid commercial loan volumes and a continued increase in new residential mortgage loans originated for investment rather than sale during the third quarter we sold only million of residential mortgage loans see further details on our loan activities under the loan portfolio section asset quality nonaccrual loans represented percent and percent of total loans at september and june respectively net recoveries of loan chargeoffs totaled million for the third quarter as compared to net loan chargeoffs of million for the second quarter total accruing past due loans increased million to million or percent of total loans at september as compared to million or percent of total loans at june see further details in the nonperforming assets section below deposits and other borrowings overall average deposits increased by billion to billion for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter mostly due to growth in our retail and brokered cd portfolios the retail growth resulted from strategic cd campaigns while the brokered cd growth resulted from our increased utilization of brokered deposits as a favorable funding alternative during the third quarter average noninterestbearing deposits savings now and money market deposits and time deposits represented approximately percent percent and percent of total deposits as of september respectively actual ending balances for deposits increased billion to approximately billion at september from june largely due to the increased utilization of brokered deposits consisting of both money market and time deposit accounts in our funding mix total brokered deposits increased to billion at september as compared to billion at june noninterest bearing deposits decreased million at september as compared to june largely due to fluctuations in certain commercial customer balances as well as some migration of both commercial and retail balances to interest bearing deposit products while our overall deposit levels increased during the third quarter w e believe the current operating environment will likely remain very challenging for valleys deposit gathering initiatives as a result we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain deposit levels at or near those reported at september the following table presents average shortterm and longterm borrowings for the periods indicated three months ended nine months ended september june september

subordinated debt securities sold under repurchase agreements junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts total average shortterm borrowings increased million during the third quarter as compared to the third quarter mostly due to an increase in the balance of federal funds purchased as a part of our overall funding strategy partially offset by less utilization of fhlb advances average longterm borrowings including junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts which are presented separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition decreased million from the third quarter largely due to the repayment of longterm repurchase agreements during the third quarter and to a lesser extent maturities of fhlb advances over the last months actual ending balances for shortterm borrowings decreased million to million at september as compared to june largely due to the maturity of fhlb advances during the third quarter and our increased utilization of broker deposits as a favorable alternative funding source in our funding mix at september longterm borrowings increased to approximately billion at september as compared to billion at june primarily due to the issuance of new subordinated notes during the third quarter on september valley issued million of percent fixedtofloating rate subordinated notes due september at september the subordinated notes had a carrying value of million net of unamortized debt issuance costs nongaap financial measures the table below presents selected performance indicators their comparative nongaap measures and

the second quarter and increased million from the third quarter interest income on a tax equivalent basis in the third quarter increased million to million as compared to the second quarter the increase was mostly due to higher average loan balances driven by our organic loan growth and increased yields on both new originations and adjustable rate loans in our portfolio interest expense of million for the third quarter increased million as compared to the second quarter largely due to higher interest rates on both nonmaturity deposits and shortterm borrowings as well as a billion increase in average interest bearing liabilities average interest earning assets increased billion to billion for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter primarily due to the acquisitions of bank leumi usa and westchester on april and december respectively as well as strong organic loan growth over the 12month period ended september compared to the second quarter average interest earning assets increased by billion during the third quarter the increase was primarily driven by a billion increase in average loan balances due to organic loan growth mainly in the commercial loan categories as well as residential mortgage loans average interest bearing liabilities increased billion to billion for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter mainly due to billion of interest bearing deposits assumed from bank leumi usa growth in commercial and retail customer deposit balances without stated maturities and brokered deposits and million of interest bearing deposits assumed from westchester as compared to the second quarter average interest bearing liabilities increased by billion in the third quarter mainly due to growth in our retail and brokered cd portfolios partially offset by maturities and less use of shortterm borrowings as a funding source the retail growth resulted from successful targeted cd campaigns while the brokered cd growth resulted from our increased utilization of such deposits as a costeffective funding alternative total average deposits including noninterest bearing deposits increased billion to billion for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter see additional information under deposits and other borrowings in the executive summary section above our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis of percent for the third quarter increased by basis points and basis points from percent and percent for the second quarter and third quarter respectively the yield on average interest earning assets increased by basis points on a linked quarter basis mostly due to the aforementioned higher yields on new and adjustable rate loans in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter the yield on average loans increased by basis points to percent for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter largely due to the higher level of market interest rates the yields on average taxable and nontaxable investments also increased basis points and basis points respectively from the second quarter largely due to investment maturities and prepayments redeployed into new higher yielding securities as well as lower premium amortization expense caused by a decline in prepayments on mortgagebacked securities during the third quarter our cost of total average deposits increased to percent for the third quarter from percent for the second quarter the overall cost of average interest bearing liabilities also increased basis points to percent for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter the increased cost of funds was mainly due to higher interest rates on most of our interest bearing deposit products combined with greater utilization of brokered and retail cds in our funding mix during the third quarter the federal reserve continued to raise the federal funds rate by basis points after each of their meetings in july september and november resulting in a current target range of percent to percent the higher levels of market interest rates will benefit certain interest earning assets on our balance sheet and are likely to provide us the opportunity to reinvest any excess cash including normal repayments of loans and investments at higher rates funding costs also increased during the third quarter and the early stages of the fourth quarter however at this time we expect a continued benefit to our net interest income from the immediate repricing of certain earning assets and a degree of lag in higher funding costs due to the current market and our ability to manage the balance sheet while our outlook for our net interest income in the fourth quarter and beyond is positive we cannot provide any assurances with respect to the future trajectory of market interest rates or that our net interest margin or income will remain at the levels reported for the third quarter the following table reflects the components of net interest income for the three

additional revenues generated by our advisory firm dudley ventures llc specializing in the investment and management of tax credit investments which we acquired in october insurance commissions increased million and million for the three and nine months ended september respectively as compared to the same periods in mostly due to stronger business volumes generated by the banks insurance agency subsidiary service charges on deposit accounts increased by million and million for the three and nine months ended september respectively as compared to the same periods in largely related to revenues resulting from deposit accounts acquired from bank leumi usa net losses on securities transactions of million for the nine months ended september were mostly due to net trading losses related

losses on our loans originated for sale and carried at fair value at each reporting period end net gains on sales of loans decreased million and million for the three and nine months ended september respectively as compared to the same periods of the third quarter decrease was mostly due to lower loan sale volumes as we sold approximately million of residential mortgage loans compared to million during the third quarter the mark to market change on loans held for sale at fair value resulted in net losses totaling thousand and thousand for the three months ended september and respectively and million and million for the nine months ended september and respectively our ability to generate net gains on sales of loans could continue to be challenged by a number of factors including increases in market interest rates lower customer demand for conforming loan products and our decision to originate certain residential mortgage loans for investment in our loan portfolio rather than sale see further discussion of our residential mortgage loan origination activity under the loan portfolio section of this mda below other noninterest income increased million and million for the three and nine months ended september as compared to the same periods in respectively partially due to higher fee income from derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial lending customers caused by

professional and legal fees loss on extinguishment of debt amortization of tax credit investments other total noninterest expense salary and employee benefits expense increased million and million for the three and nine months ended september respectively as compared to the same periods of the increases in both periods were primarily due to strategic increases in our headcount to enhance lending

with the increases in wage demand across the industry in addition salary and employee benefits expense included approximately million and mi llion of merger related expenses for the three and nine

increased million and million for the three and nine months ended september respectively as compared to the same periods of mainly due to higher lease expense depreciation expense and repair and maintenance costs as well as million of merger related expense for the third quarter technology furniture and equipment expense increased million and million for the three and nine months ended

approximately million of longterm fhlb advances during the second quarter other noninterest expense increased million and million f or the three and nine months ended september respectively as compared to the same periods of these increases within this expense category mostly related to incrementally higher operating expenses due to the expansion of our operations including acquisitions of

compared to million and million for the second quarter and third quarter respectively our effective tax rate was percent percent and percent for the third quarter second quarter and third quarter respectively the increase in the effective tax rate in the third quarter as compared to the third quarter was partly due to a million excess stock compensation benefit recognized in the period us gaap requires that any change in judgment or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period be recognized as a discrete event in the quarter in which it occurs rather than being recognized as a change in effective tax rate for the current year our adherence to these tax guidelines may result in volatile effective income tax rates in future quarterly and annual periods factors that could impact managements judgment include changes in income tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies based on the current information available we anticipate that our effective tax rate will range from percent to percent for the remainder of exclusive of pending potential tax rate increases operating segments prior to the second quarter valley operated as four reportable

extent home equity loans secured personal lines of credit and other consumer loans including credit card loans the duration of the residential mortgage loan portfolio which represented percent of our loan portfolio at september is subject to movements in the market level of interest rates and forecasted prepayment speeds the weighted average life of the automobile loans representing percent of total loans at september is relatively unaffected by movements in the market level of interest rates however the average life may be impacted by new loans as a result of the availability of credit within the automobile marketplace and consumer demand for purchasing new or used automobiles consumer lending also includes the wealth management and insurance services division comprised of trust asset management brokerage insurance and tax credit advisory services average interest earning assets in consumer lending increased million to billion for the three months ended september as compared to the third quarter the increase was mostly due to new residential mortgage loan volumes originated for investment rather than sale over the last 12month period as well as growth in automobile loans and secured personal lines of credit loans acquired from bank leumi usa on april and westchester on december did not materially impact this operating segment income before income taxes generated by consumer lending decreased million to million for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter largely due to a million increase in the provision for loan losses a million increase in the internal transfer expense and higher noninterest expense the higher internal transfer expense and noninterest expense was mostly driven by general increases related to organic growth in our retail business and the recent bank acquisitions the increase in the provision for loan losses was mainly due to higher quantitative reserves for residential mortgage loans loan growth and qualitative reserve allocations related to hurricane ian in this category the negative impact of these items was partially offset by a million increase in noninterest income for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter largely due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts and brokerage fees within wealth management and trust fees partially o ffset by lower gains on sales of residential mortgage loans the net interest income also increased by a million in the third quarter as compared to the same quarter in the prior year mainly driven by higher average loan balances the net interest margin on the consumer lending portfolio decreased basis points to percent for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter mainly due to a basis point increase in the costs associated with our funding sou rces partially offset by a basis point increase in the yield on average loans the increase in our funding costs was mainly due to the rising market interest rate environment additional funding sourced through brokered deposits and fhlb advances for loan growth and a shift in some customer preference to the interestbearing deposit products from noninterest bearing during the third quarter the basis point increase in loan yield was largely due to higher yielding new loan volumes and normal repayments of lower yielding loans over the last 12month period see the executive summary

at september commercial real estate loans and construction loans totaled billion and represented percent of the total loan portfolio at september average interest earning assets in this segment increased approximately billion to billion for the three months ended september as compared to the third quarter mostly due to acquired loans from bank leumi usa and westchester and strong new organic

million at september as compared to million at september due to sba loan forgiveness income before income taxes for the three months ended september for commercial lending increased million to million as compared to the third quarter the increase was mainly driven by increases in both net interest income and noninterest income and lower provision for loan losses partially offset by an increase in the internal transfer expense net interest income for this segment increased million to million for the third quarter as compared to the same period in primarily due to additional income generated on higher average loan balances and loan yield noninterest income increased million to million for the three months ended september as compared to the third quarter the increase was mostly due to general

bank of new york expenses related to the branch network all other components of retail banking along with the back office departments of the bank are allocated from treasury and corporate other to the consumer lending and commercial lending segments interest expense and internal transfer expense for general corporate expenses are allocated to each business segment utilizing a transfer pricing

disclosed in this segment include net gains and losses on available for sale and held to maturity securities transactions interest expense related to subordinated notes amortization and impairment of tax credit investments as well as other noncore items including merger expenses average interest earning assets in this segment increased million during the three months ended september mainly due to an increase of billion in average taxable investment securities partially offset by lower a verage interest bearing deposits with banks the increase in the average investment securities balance was mainly due to billion of investment securities acquired from bank leumi usa average interest bearing deposits with banks decreased billion as compared to the same period in mainly due to continued funding of loan growth fluctuations in the timing of loan and investment activity and surge deposits from customers that drove higher levels of excess liquidity in the third quarter the pretax loss for this segment totaled million for the three months ended september as compared to a million for the same period in the million increase in the pretax loss during the period was mainly due to increases in noninterest expense that were partially offset by an increase in internal transfer income noninterest expense increased million to million during the three months ended september as compared to the same period a year ago largely due to increases in technology furniture and equipment and occupancy expense as well as higher salaries and employee benefit expenses incurred during the third quarter and our expanded banking operations resulting from the bank leumi usa acquisition see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda the internal transfer income increased by million to million for the three months ended september as compared to the same period a year ago mostly due to general increases related to our growth and recent acquisitions the net interest margin for this segment increased basis points to percent for the for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter due to a basis point increase in the yield on average investments partially offset by a basis point increase in cost of our funding sources the increase in the yield on average investments as compared to the third quarter was largely due to investment maturities and prepayments redeployed into new higher yielding securities as well as lower premium amortization expense caused by a decline in prepayments on mortgagebacked securities

earning assets before tax consumer lending consumer lendings average interest earning assets increased million to billion for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in the

lines of credit income before income taxes generated by consumer lending decreased million to million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in largely due to a million increase in the internal transfer expense coupled with a higher provision for loan losses and higher noninterest expense the provision for loan losses increased million for the nine months ended september from million credit negative provision for the same period of the increase in provision was mainly due to higher reserves related to residential loan growth see further details in the allowance for credit losses section of this mda net interest income increased million primarily due to additional income generated on higher average loan balances noninterest income also increased million mostly due to increases in wealth management and trust fees and service charges on deposit accounts caused by our recent acquisitions partially offset by lower net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in net interest margin on the consumer lending portfolio decreased basis points to percent for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period one year ago mainly due to a basis point decrease in the yield on average loans and a basis point increase in the costs associated with our funding sources the basis point decrease in loan yield was largely due to lower yielding new loan volumes prior to the second quarter and normal loan repayments the increase in our funding costs was mainly due to higher interest rates on most of our interest bearing deposit products including brokered deposits a low er mix of noninterest bearing deposits and higher cost shortterm borrowings due to the rising interest rate environment in commercial lending average interest earning assets in commercial lending increased billion to billion for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to strong organic loan growth over the 12month period ended september as well as loans acquired from bank leumi usa and westchester for the nine months ended september income before income taxes for commercial lending increased million to million as compared to the same period in mainly driven by increases net interest income and noninterest income partially offset by higher i nternal transfer expense and provision for loan losses net interest income increased million to million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in mainly due to higher average commercial loan balances and loan yield during the period noninterest income increased million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in mainly due to a million increase in fee income related to derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial loan customers a million increase in foreign exchange fees and higher service charges on commercial deposit accounts internal transfer expense increased million to million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in largely due to the significant acquired and organic expansion of our operations over the last 12month period t he provision for credit losses increased million to million during the nine months ended september as compared to million for the

million during the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in within the category a billion increase in taxable investment securities was partially offset by a million decrease in average interest bearing deposits with banks the increase in average taxable investment securities was mainly due to billion of investment securities acquired from bank leumi usa the lower levels of excess liquidity were mainly due to the strong organic loan growth over the last 12month period and a reduction in the impact of surge customer deposits as compared to the period the pretax loss for this segment totaled million for the nine months ended september as compared to million for the same period in the million increase in pretax loss was mainly due to an increase in noninterest expense largely offset by higher in internal transfer income and net interest income noninterest expense increased million to million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in partially due to a million increase in merger related expenses as well as other additional expenses related to our expanded banking operations and organic business growth however the comparative period also included an million pretax l oss on extinguishment of debt see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda internal transfer income increased million to million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in due to the higher allocation of noninterest expense over the same period treasury and corporate others net interest margin increased basis points to percent for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in due to a basis point increase in the yield on average investments and a basis point increase in cost of our funding sources the increase in the yield on average investments as compared to the same period in was largely driven by new higher yielding investments and lower premium amortization expense caused in part by slower principal repayments in the rising interest rate environment of assetliability management interest rate sensitivity our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to the movement in interest rates our assetliability management committee is responsible for managing such risks and establishing policies that monitor and coordinate our sources and uses of funds assetliability management is a continuous process due to the constant change in interest rate risk factors in assessing the appropriate interest rate risk levels for us management weighs the potential benefit of each risk management activity within the desired parameters of liquidity capital levels and managements tolerance for exposure to income fluctuations many of the actions undertaken by management utilize fair value analysis and attempt to achieve consistent accounting and economic benefits for financial assets and their related funding sources we have predominantly focused on managing our interest rate risk by attempting to match the inherent risk and cash flows of financial assets and liabilities specifically management employs multiple risk management activities such as optimizing the level of new residential mortgage originations retained in our mortgage portfolio through increasing or decreasing loan sales in the secondary market product pricing levels the desired maturity levels for new originations the composition levels of both our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as several other risk management activities we use a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a 12month and 24month period the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumptions of certain assets and liabilities as of september the model assumes immediate changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the composition or size of the balance sheet or other future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk in the model the forecasted shape of the yield curve remains static as of september the impact of interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps is also included in the model our simulation model is based on market interest rates and prepayment speeds prevalent in the market as of september although the size of valleys balance sheet is forecasted to remain static as of september in our model the composition is adjusted to reflect new interest earning assets and funding originations coupled with rate spreads utilizing our actual originations during the third quarter the model also utilizes an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates at september the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the table below due to the frequency and timing of changes in interest rates and changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories overall our net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios we actively manage these cash flows in conjunction with our liability mix duration and interest rates to optimize the net interest income while structuring the balance sheet in response to actual or potential changes in interest rates additionally our net interest income is impacted by the level of competition within our marketplace competition can negatively impact the level of interest rates attainable on loans and increase the cost of deposits which may result in downward pressure on our net interest margin in future periods other factors including but not limited to the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows will impact our net interest income results and may increase or decrease the level of asset sensitivity of our balance sheet convexity is a measure of how the duration of a financial instrument changes as market interest rates change potential movements in the convexity of bonds held in our investment portfolio as well as the duration of the loan portfolio may have a positive or negative impact on our net interest income in varying interest rate environments as a result the increase or decrease in forecasted net interest income may not have a linear relationship to the results reflected in the table below management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income the following table reflects managements expectations of the change in our net interest income over the next month period considering the aforementioned assumptions while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this simulation model we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact than shown in the table below estimated change in future net interest income changes in interest rates dollar change percentage change in basis points in thousands as noted in the table above a basis point immediate increase in interest rates combined with a static balance sheet where the size mix and proportions of assets and liabilities remain unchanged is projected to increase net interest income over the next 12month period by percent management believes the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet remains within an acceptable tolerance range at september however the level of net interest income sensitivity may increase or decrease in the future as a result of several factors including potential changes in our balance sheet strategies the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows liquidity and cash requirements bank liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due a banks liquidity reflects its ability to meet loan demand to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate opportunities in the marketplace liquidity management is carefully performed and routinely reported by our treasury department to two board committees among other actions treasury reviews historical funding requirements our current liquidity position sources and stability of funding marketability of assets options for attracting additional funds and anticipated future funding needs including the level of unfunded commitments our goal is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover current and potential funding requirements the bank has no required regulatory liquidity ratios to maintain however it adheres to an internal liquidity policy the current policy maintains that we may not have a ratio of loans to deposits in ex cess of percent or reliance on wholesale funding greater than percent of total funding the bank was in compliance with the foregoing policies at september valleys short and longterm cash requirements include contractual obligations under borrowings deposits payment related to leases capital expenditures and other purchase commitments in the ordinary course of operations the bank also enters into various financial obligations including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments management believes the bank has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its shortterm and longterm obligations as they come due by utilizing various cash resources described below on the asset side of the balance sheet the bank has numerous sources of liquid funds in the form of cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits with banks including the federal reserve bank of new york investment securities held to maturity that are maturing within days or would otherwise qualify as maturities if sold ie percent of original cost basis has been repaid investment securities classified as trading and available for sale loans held for sale and from time to time federal funds sold and receivables related to unsettled securities transactions total liquid assets were approximate ly billion representing percent of earning assets at september and billion representing percent of earning assets at december of the billion of liquid assets at september approximately million of various investment securities were pledged to counterparties to support our earning asset funding strategies we anticipate the receipt of approx imately million in principal payments from securities in the total investment portfolio at september over the next 12month period due to normally scheduled principal repayments and expected prepayments of certain securities primarily residential mortgagebacked securities additional liquidity is derived from scheduled loan payments of principal and interest as well as prepayments received loan principal payments from total loans and loans held for sale at september are projected in accordance with their scheduled contractual terms to be approximately billion over the next 12month period as a contingency plan for any liquidity constraints liquidity could also be derived from the sale of conforming residential mortgages from our loan portfolio or alleviated from the temporary curtail ment of lending activities on the liability side of the balance sheet we utilize multiple sources of funds to meet liquidity needs including retail and commercial deposits brokered and municipal deposits and shortterm and longterm borrowings our core deposit base which generally excludes fully insured brokered deposits and both retail and brokered certificates of deposit over thousand represents the largest of these sources average core deposits totaled approximately billion and billion for the nine months ended september and for the year ended december respectively representing percent and percent of average earning assets for the respective periods the level of interest bearing deposits is affected by interest rates offered which is often influenced by our need for funds and the need to match the maturities of assets and liabilities additional funding may be provided through deposit gathering networks and in the form of federal funds purchased through our wellestablished relationships with numerous banks while these lending lines are uncommitted management believes that the bank could borrow approximately billion from these banks on a collective basis the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb and has the ability to borrow from them in the form of fhlb advances secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral including but not limited to us government and agency mortgagebacked securities and a blanket assignment of qualifying first lien mortgage loans consisting of both residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans additionally valleys collateral pledged to the fhlb may be used to obtain municipal letters of credit muloc to collateralize certain municipal deposits held by valley at september valley h ad billion of mulocs outst anding for this purpose furthermore we can obtain overnight borrowings from the federal reserve bank of new york via the discount window as a contingency for additional liquidity at september our borrowing capacity under the federal reserve banks discount window was billion we also have access to other shortterm and longterm borrowing sources to support our asset base such as repos ie securities sold under agreements to repurchase shortterm borrowings consisting of fhlb advances repos and from time to time federal funds purchased increased approximately million to million at september as compared to december mainly due a higher utilization of fhlb advances partially offset by lower repo balances at september corporation liquidity valleys recurring cash requirements primarily consist of dividends to preferred and common shareholders and interest expense on subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts as part of our ongoing assetliability management strategies valley could also use cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock under its share repurchase program or redeem its callable junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes valleys cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the bank projected cash flows from the bank are expected to be adequate to pay preferred and common dividends if declared and interest expense payable to subordinated note holders and capital trusts given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of the bank in addition to dividends received from the bank valley can satisfy its cash requirements by utilizing its own cash and potential new funds borrowed from outside sources or capital issuances valley also has the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarterly periods up to five years but not beyond the stated maturity dates and subject to other conditions investment securities portfolio as of september we had million billion and billion in equity available for sale and held to maturity debt securities respectively there were million of trading debt securities at september consisting of investment grade municipal bonds and us treasury securities the equity securities consisted of two publicly traded mutual funds cra investments and several other equity investments we have made in companies that develop new financial technologies and in partnerships that invest in such companies our cra and other equity investments are a mix of both publicly traded entities and privately held entities the available for sale and held to maturity debt securities portfolios which comprise the majority of the securities we own include us treasury securities us government agency securities taxexempt and taxable issuances of states and political subdivisions residential mortgagebacked securities singleissuer trust preferred securities principally issued by bank holding companies and high quality corporate bonds among other securities our available for sale debt securities include securities such as bank issued and other corporate bonds as well as municipal special revenue bonds which may pose a higher risk of future impairment charges to us as a result of the uncertain economic environment and its potential negative effect on the future performance of the security issuers we acquired million million and million of equity securities available for sale debt and held to maturity debt securities respectively from bank leumi usa on april allowance for credit losses and impairment analysis available for sale debt securities available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly in assessing whether a credit loss exists we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded limited to the amount the fair value is less than amortized cost basis declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses such as declines due to changes in market interest rates are recorded through other comprehensive loss net of applicable taxes we have evaluated all available for sale debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of september and december and determined that the declines in fair value were mainly attributable to changes in market volatility due to factors such as interest rates and spread factors but not attributable to credit quality or other factors based on a comparison of the present value of expected cash flows to the amortized cost management recognized no impairment charges during the three and nine months ended september and the year ended december as a result there was no allowance for credit losses for available for sale debt securities at september and december held to maturity debt securities valley estimates the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party valley has a zeroloss expectation for certain securities within the held to maturity portfolio including us treasury securities us agency securities residential mortgagebacked securities issued by ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac and collateralized municipal bonds to measure the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations valley estimates the expected credit losses using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party assumptions used in the model for pools of securities with common risk characteristics include the historical lifetime probability of default and severity of loss in the event of default with the model incorporating several economic cycles of loss history data to calculate expected credit losses given default at the individual security level held to maturity debt securities were carried net of an allowance for credit losses totaling approximately million and million at september and december respectively there were no net chargeoffs of held to maturity debt securities for the three and nine months ended september and investment grades the investment grades in the table below reflect the most current independent analysis performed by third parties of each security as of the date presented and not necessarily the investment grades at the date of our purchase of the securities for many securities the rating agencies may not have performed an independent analysis of the tranches owned by us but rather an analysis of the entire investment pool for this and other reasons we believe the assigned investment grades may not accurately reflect the actual credit quality of each security and should not be viewed in isolation as a measure of the quality of our investment portfolio the following table presents the held to maturity and available for sale debt securities portfolios by investment grades at september september amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value in thousands available for sale investment grades aaa rated aa rated a

related to residential mortgagebacked securities issued by ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac and continued to be driven by the rising interest rate environment during the third quarter the investment securities held to maturity portfolio included million of investments not rated by the rating agencies with aggregate unrealized losses of million at september mostly related to four

residential mortgage consumer loans total includes net unearned discount and deferred loan fees of million million and million at september june and december respectively the increases from december were largely due to a million net purchase discount associated with the loans acquired from bank leumi usa on april loans increased billion to approximately billion at september from june largely due

percent percent and percent respectively on an annualized basis during the third quarter commercial and industrial loans increased million to billion at september as compared to june excluding ppp loans the commercial and industrial loan organic growth totale d million during the third quarter mainly due to solid organic loan volumes largely amongst our preexisting longterm customer base across most of our primary market areas in addition the new loan pipeline was driven by direct calling efforts of our commercial lending team sba paycheck protection program ppp loans decreased million to million at september compared to million at june mainly due to loan forgiveness repayments commercial real estate loans excluding construction loans increased billion to billion at september from june driven by solid organic growth mainly in the nonowner occupied and multifamily loan portfolios the new loan volumes were generated across most of our geographic footprints construction loans increased million to billion at september from june mainly due to a high volume of advances on new and to a lesser extent preexisting construction projects during the third quarter residential mortgage loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis during the third quarter primarily due to new loan activity in the purchased home market and an increase in such loans originated for investment rather than sale new and refinanced residential mortgage loan originations totaled million for the third quarter as compared to million and million for the second quarter and third quarter respectively florida originations totaled million and represented percent of total residential mortgage loan originations in the quarter of the total originations in the third quarter only million of residential mortgage loans were originated for sale rather than held for investment as compared to million during the second quarter during the third quarter we retained approximately percent of the total residential mortgages originations in our held for investment loan portfolio we sold approximately million of residential mortgage loans held for sale during the third quarter we may continue to retain a higher percentage of new loan volumes during the fourth quarter due to several factors including consumer demand and preferences for certain mortgage products and our management of the interest rate risk and the mix of the interest earning assets on our balance sheet additionally the volume of both new and refinanced loan applications have continued to decline in the early stages of the fourth quarter due to the increase in the level of mortgage interest rates and may challenge our ability to grow this loan category home equity loans increased by million to million at september compared to june however new home equity loan volumes and customer usage of existing home equity lines of credit continue to be modest and we anticipate growth in this loan category to be challenged by the unfavorable rising interest rate environment automobile loans increased by million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at september as compared to june as loan originations volumes continued to outpace loan repayments during the third quarter however loan originations slowed significantly during the third quarter as demand for new and used vehicle financing declined due to the higher interest rate environment w e originated million in auto loans through our dealership network during the third quarter as compared to million in the second quarter of the total originations our florida dealership network contributed million in auto loan originations representing approximately percent of new loans during the third quarter despite increased new automobile inventories available to consumers we anticipate that the impact of inflation on average new vehicle prices coupled with rising interest rates could have a negative impact on our ability to grow this loan category during the fourth quarter other consumer loans increased million to billion at september from june a large part of our lendin g is in northern and central new jersey new york city long island and florida to mitigate our geographic risks we make efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to guard against a potential downward turn in any one economic sector despite the moderate decline in new loan originations for the third quarter we anticipate solid organic commercial and industrial nonppp and commercial real estate loan growth to continue in the fourth quarter based upon current projections we anticipate a range of to percent annualized loan growth for the fourth quarter however there can be no assurance that those positive trends will continue or balances will not decline from september due to several factors including but not limited to persistently high inflation the federal reserves rapid monetary policy tightening and the ongoing negative impact of russiaukraine war on the global economy in addition w e anticipate that residential mortgage and other consumer loan activity will continue to slow meaningfully in the fourth quarter nonperforming assets nonperforming assets npa include nonaccrual loans other real estate owned oreo and other repossessed assets which primarily consists of automobiles and taxi medallions at september loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal or interest exceptions to the nonaccrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection oreo is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate oreo and other repossessed assets are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell our npas decreased million to million at september as compared to june mostly due to declines in nonaccrual commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans mainly caused by a few large loan repayments and to a lesser extent loan chargeoffs during the third quarter npas as a percentage of total loans and npas totaled percent and percent at september and june respectively as shown in the table below we believe our total npas has remained relatively low as a percentage of the total loan portfolio and the level of npas is reflective of our consistent approach to the loan underwriting criteria for both valley originated loans and loans purchased from third parties for additional details see the credit quality indicators section in note to the consolidated financial statements our lending strategy is based on underwriting standards designed to maintain high credit quality and we remain optimistic regarding the overall future performance of our loan portfolio during the nine months ended september our overall credit trends have remained stable and our business and borrowers continued to demonstrate resilience and growth despite the challenges of the global supply chain issues high inflation and overall uncertain economy and the ongoing impact of covid19 however management cannot provide assurance that the nonperforming assets will not materially increase from the levels reported at september due to the aforementioned or other factors potentially impacting our lending customers the following table sets

this delinquency category decreased million due to one loan acquired from bank leumi usa included in this category at june that is reported as to days past due at september commercial real estate loans past due to days decreased million to million at september as compared to june mainly due to one loan that became current as to all contractual payments at september these decreases were largely offset by higher commercial and industrial loans delinquencies mostly driven by matured loans in the process of renewal included in this category at september loans past due to days increased million to million at september as compared to june mainly due to the one aforementioned construction loan that migrated to this delinquency category at september loans past due days or more and still accruing interest increased million to million at september as compared to june the increase was mainly driven by the two commercial real estate loan relationships totaling million and million respectively included in this delinquency category at september all loans days or more past due and still accruing interest are considered wellsecured and in the process of collection nonaccrual loans decreased million to million at september as compared to million at june mainly due to decreases in nonperforming c ommercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans partially offset by one construction loan relationship totaling million put on nonaccrual status at september nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans totaled million at september and included nonperforming taxi medallion loans totaling million nonperforming taxi medallion loans decreased million from million at june mostly due to partial loan chargeoffs totaling million related to one borrower during the third quarter the partial loan chargeoffs were fully reserved for in our allowance for loan losses at june at september the taxi medallion loans primarily collateralized by new york city medallions had related reserve s of million or percent of such l oans potential declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions and the stressed operating environment within new york city due to the covid19 pandemic or general deterioration in economic conditions could negatively impact the future performance of this portfolio for example a percent decline in our current estimated market value of the taxi medallions would require additional allocated reserve s of million within the allow ance for loan losses based upon the taxi medallion loan balances at september see the allowance for credit losses for loans section below for further details on our reserves oreo properties totaled thousand at september and declined thousand as compared to june during the third quarter oreo activity continues to trend downward as sales of owned properties outpaced new foreclosures the sales of oreo properties resulted in net losses of thousand and thousand for the three and nine months ended september respectively

properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process totale d million and million at september and december respectively tdrs represent loan modifications for customers experiencing financial difficulties where a concession has been granted performing tdrs ie tdrs not reported as loans days or more past due and still accruing interest or as nonaccrual loans totaled million at september as compared to million at june performing tdrs consisted of loans at september on an aggregate basis the million in performing tdrs at september had a modified weighted average interest rate of approximately percent as compared to a premodification weighted average interest rate of percent allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses acl for loans includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments under cecl our methodology to establish the allowance for loan losses has two basic components i a collective reserve component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics and ii an individual reserve component for loans that do not share risk characteristics consisting of collateral dependent tdr and expected tdr loans valley also maintains a separate allowance for unfunded credit commitments mainly consisting of undisbursed noncancellable lines of credit new loan commitments and commercial standby letters of credit valley estimated the collective acl using a current expected credit losses methodology which is based on relevant information about historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the loan balances in estimating the component of the allowance on a collective basis we use a transition matrix model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan pool by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics the metrics are based on the migration of loans from performing to loss by credit quality rating or delinquency categories using historical lifeofloan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool and the severity of loss based on the aggregate net lifetime losses the models expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative factors among other things these adjustments include and account for differences in i the impact of the reasonable and supportable economic forecast relative probability weightings and reversion period ii other asset specific risks to the extent they do not exist in the historical loss information and iii net expected recoveries of chargedoff loan balances these adjustments are based on qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses the expected lifetime loss rate is the life of loan loss percentage from the transition matrix model plus the impact of the adjustments for qualitative factors the expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the models expected lifetime loss rate by the exposure at default at period end on an undiscounted basis valley utilizes a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a oneyear period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the loan on a straightline basis the forecasts consist of a multiscenario economic forecast model to estimate future credit losses and is governed by a crossfunctional committee the committee meets each quarter to determine which economic scenarios developed by moodys will be incorporated into the model as well as the relative probability weightings of the selected scenarios based upon all readily available information the model projects economic variables under each scenario based on detailed statistical analyses we have identified and selected key variables that most closely correlated to our historical credit performance which include gdp unemployment and the caseshiller home price index for the third quarter we incorporated a probability weighted threescenario economic forecast including moodys baseline s3 and s4 scenarios at september valley moderately increased its probability weighting to the combined moodys s3 downside and s4 most adverse scenarios from the moodys baseline scenario as compared with such weighting in the june acl analysis our scenario weighting at september as well as the standalone moodys baseline scenario reflects a less optimistic outlook than at june in terms of gdp growth unemployment levels and potential near term negative economic impacts given present uncertain economic conditions at september the moodys baseline forecast included the following specific assumptions gdp expansion by about percent in the fourth quarter unemployment of percent in the fourth quarter and to percent over the remainder of the forecast period ending in the third quarter and us economic growth continues in however it is expected to be challenged by a strained supply chain rising interest rates and elevated inflation that will negatively affect consumer spending see more
