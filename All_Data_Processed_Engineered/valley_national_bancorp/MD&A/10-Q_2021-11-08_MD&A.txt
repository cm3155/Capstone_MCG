including the risk factors section of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december and part ii item of this quarterly report critical accounting policies and estimates valleys accounting policies are fundamental to understanding managements discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations at september we identified our policies on the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical accounting policies because management has to make subjective andor complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions management has reviewed the application of these policies with the audit committee of valleys board of directors our critical accounting policies are described in detail in part ii item in valleys annual report on form 10k for the year ended

noninterest income impact of covid19 economic activity and businesses continued to rebound in the third quarter however the us is experiencing significant global supply chain disruptions and labor shortages which have also increased inflation w e continue to monitor the impact of covid19 closely including its impact on our employees customers communities and results of operations and other government stimulus or federal reserve actions the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our operations and financial results during the fourth quarter and beyond is highly uncertain we continue to closely monitor local conditions in the areas we serve and will take actions as circumstances warrant and will follow proper protocols designed to ensure safety of our employees and customers see the operating environment section of mda for more details the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act and additional legislation that followed including the consolidated appropriations act and the american rescue plan act of provided funding for the sbas paycheck protection program ppp and established rules for qualifying borrowers to receive loan forgiveness by the sba under this program valley extended a total of billion ppp loans under the program of which billion of these loans have received forgiveness from the sba including million during the third quarter as of september we had million of ppp loans still outstanding in response to the covid19 pandemic and its economic impact on certain customers and in accordance with provisions set forth by the cares act valley implemented shortterm loan modifications such as payment deferrals fee waivers extensions of repayment terms or delays in payment that are insignificant when requested by customers as of september vall ey had million of outstanding loans remaining in their payment deferral period under shortterm modifications representing approximately percent of our total loan portfolio at september as compared to million or percent of total loans at december quarterly results net income for the third quarter was million or per diluted common share compared to million or per diluted common share for the third quarter the million increase in quarterly net income as compared to the same quarter one year ago was largely due to a million increase in net interest income mainly due to i lower rates on our deposit products combined with a continued customer shift to deposits without stated maturities ii runoff of higher cost time deposits iii lower average other borrowings and related costs driven by normal maturities of fhlb advances and longterm repos as well as our prepayments of million and million of longterm fhlb borrowings in december and june respectively and a million decrease in our provision for credit losses mainly due to the improved economic forecast component of the reserve as compared to september partially offset by a million decrease in noninterest income mainly due to the combination of lower gains on sales of residential mortgage loans and lower fee income related to derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial lending customers partially offset by moderate increases in other fee categories a million increase in noninterest expense primarily due to higher salary and employee benefits expenses and increased professional and legal fees including an accrual of million for general litigation reserves partially offset by a million decrease in the loss on the early extinguishment as compared to the third quarter and a million increase in income tax expense mainly due to higher income before income taxes see the net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense and income taxes sections below for more details on the items above impacting our third quarter results operating environment during the third quarter real gross domestic product expanded percent compared to percent growth in the second quarter the deceleration in growth was driven by personal consumption and business fixed investment as inflation remained elevated partly offset by inventory restocking and government spending the federal reserve continued to maintain an accommodative stance on monetary policy to keep interest rates low and promote liquidity at their meeting in september the federal open market committee the committee maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between and percent additionally the committee decided to maintain several programs including purchasing us treasury and mortgage backed securities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses in order to promote its maximum employment and price stability goals notwithstanding this the committee indicated that a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted the 10year us treasury note yield ended the third quarter at percent basis points higher as compared with june the spread between the and 10year us treasury note yields ended the third quarter at percent basis points higher as compared to the end of the second quarter and basis points higher as compared to june for all commercial banks in the us loans and leases increased approximately percent in the third quarter as compared to the previous quarter for the industry banks reported more relaxed credit standards for most loan types additionally banks reported that demand had firmed or increased during the third quarter which finally translated into stronger loan growth in the third quarter valley continued to see strong organic growth demand for commercial real estate loans and several other loan types across its geographic footprint inflation has been elevated which could adversely impact companies if they cannot pass along higher input costs to their customers should inflation pressures persist this dynamic among other external factors could challenge our business operations as highlighted throughout the remaining mda discussion below loans total loans increased million to billion at september from june in spite of a million decrease in ppp loans within the commercial and industrial loan category our nonppp loan portfolio increased million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at september from billion at june the increase in nonppp loans was largely driven by increases of million million and million in the commercial real estate construction and residential mortgage categories respectively additionally our third quarter new and refinanced loan originations included approximately million of residential mortgage loans originated for sale net gains on sales of residential loans were million and million in the third quarter and second quarter respectively see further details on our loan activities under the loan portfolio section below asset quality total nonperforming assets npas consisting of nonaccrual loans other real estate owned oreo and other repossessed assets increased million to million at september as compared to june nonaccrual loans increased million to million at september as compared to june mainly due to the million increase in nonaccrual commercial real estate loans from three loan relationships which have million of related allowance reserves as of september nonaccrual loans represented percent of total loans at september as compared to percent at june total accruing past due loans ie loans past due days or more and still accruing interest decreased million to million or percent of total loans at september as compared to million or percent of total loans at june the decrease was driven by the transition of the aforementioned three commercial real estate loan delinquencies from accruing past due loans to nonaccrual loan status see further details in the nonperforming assets section below deposits and other borrowings overall average deposits increased by million to billion for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter due to continued growth in both commercial and retail customer balances av erage noninterest bearing deposits savings now and money market deposits and time deposits represented approximately percent percent and percent of total deposits as of september respectively our mix of average deposits for the third quarter also continued to shift away from time deposits into the nonmaturity deposit categories as compared to the second quarter as some funding from maturing retail cds migrate to the more liquid deposit products and normal growth in such categories actual ending balances for deposits increased million to approximately billion at september from june largely due to increases of million and million in the nonmaturity interest bearing deposit and noninterest bearing deposit categories respectively partially offset by a million decrease in time deposits the decrease of million in time deposits was driven by normal runoff of maturing retail cds with the aforementioned migration of some retail balances to more liquid lower cost deposit product categories total brokered deposits within money market deposit accounts decreased approximately million to billion at september as compared to billion at june as our funding profile has benefited from the surge in commercial and retail deposit balances noninterest bearing deposits savings now and money market deposits and time deposits represented approximately percent percent and percent of total deposits as of september respectively while we believe the current operating environment will likely continue to be favorable for valleys deposit gathering initiatives we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain deposit levels at or near those reported at september average shortterm borrowings decreased million to million for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter due to normal debt maturities funded with excess cash liquidity average longterm borrowings including junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts which are presented separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition decreased by million to billion for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter largely due to combination of i the million of fhlb advances which were prepaid in late june ii repayments upon maturities of fhlb advances and iii million of longterm repurchase agreements which matured during the third quarter with these decreases partially offset by iv the million subordinated notes issued in late may which were outstanding for the full quarter in third quarter actual ending balances for shortterm borrowings decreased by million to million at september as compared to june largely due to repayments of fhlb advances longterm borrowings decreased by million to billion at september as compared to june mainly due to the maturity of million of longterm repurchase agreements and million of fhlb advances which were repaid with excess liquidity during the third quarter

expenses net of tax b add litigation reserves net of tax b net income as adjusted a included in gains on securities transactions net b included in professional and legal fees in addition to the items used to calculate net income as adjusted in the table above our net income is from time to time impacted by fluctuations in the level of net gains on sales of loans and swap fees recognized from commercial loan customer transactions these amounts can vary widely from period to period due to among other factors the amount of residential mortgage loans originated for sale loan portfolio sales

income net interest income consists of interest income and dividends earned on interest earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities and represents the main source of income for valley net interest income on a tax equivalent basis totaling million for the third quarter decreased thousand as compared to the second quarter and increased million from the third quarter interest expense of million for the third quarter decreased million as compared to the second quarter as we continue to reduce our cost of funding from both deposits and our repayment of other borrowings primarily fhlb advances interest income on a tax equivalent basis in the third quarter decreased by million to million as compared to the second quarter largely due to a million decline in ppp loan related interest and fees caused by lower levels of loan forgiveness prepayments in the third quarter and lower yields on nonppp new and renewed loans average interest earning assets increased million to billion for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter primarily due to higher levels of excess liquidity held in overnight investments with banks caused by the surge in customer deposit balances and fluctuations in the timing of loan and investment funding as compared to the second quarter average interest earning assets increased by million from billion mostly driven by higher levels of excess overnight liquidity and purchases of new taxable investments partially offset by principal repayments in both the taxable and nontaxable investment portfolios average interest bearing liabilities decreased billion to billion for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter primarily due to the repayment of borrowings with excess cash liquidity over the last 12month period as compared to the second quarter average interest bearing liabilities decreased by million in the third quarter mainly due to repayments of shortterm and longterm borrowings which were largely offset by the surge in both commercial and retail customer deposits total average deposits increased million to billion for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter see additional information under deposits and other borrowings in the executive summary section above our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis of percent for the third quarter decreased by basis points and increased by basis points from percent and percent for the second quarter and third quarter respectively the yield on average interest earning assets decreased by basis points on a linked quarter basis mostly due to the lower yield on new and renewed loans partially offset by one additional day in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter the yield on average loans decreased by basis points to percent for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter the overall cost of average interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to percent for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter the decrease was mainly due to i the continued runoff of maturing higher cost time deposits ii repayment of maturing fhlb advances and other borrowings during the third quarter iii the prepayment of million of longterm fhlb advances in june and iv the overall lower cost of deposits our cost of total average deposits was percent for the third quarter as compared to percent for the second quarter looking forward we expect moderate ongoing interest rate pressures on our net interest margin for the fourth quarter and beyond due to the low level of market rates and the potential negative impact on the overall yield on new and refinanced loan originations however we are also encouraged by the continued potential opportunity to selectively redeploy low yielding excess cash liquidity into new loans and investments during the fourth quarter as well as repay or reprice at low costs stated maturity deposits totaling approximately billion with an average cost of basis

activity under the loan portfolio section of this mda below bank owned life insurance income increased million for the three months ended september as compared to the same period in the increase was attributable to a mortality contingency reserve adjustment recorded in third quarter other noninterest income decreased million and million for the three and nine months ended september respectively

strategic increases in our headcount to enhance lending and operations and increases in our branch compensation to preserve staffing and service levels and to keep pace with the increases in wage demand across the industry in addition higher cash and stockbased incentive compensation accruals and health insurance costs also contributed to the increases in both periods fdic insurance assessment

profile professional and legal fees increased million and million f or the three and nine months ended september respectively as compared to the same periods of the increases were largely attributable

expenses mostly related to our technology transformation efforts and new product initiati ves loss on extinguishment of debt totaled million for the nine months ended september reflecting the prepayment of approximately million of longterm fhlb advances during the second quarter the loss on extinguishment of debt totaling million during the three and nine months ended september was related to the prepayment of million of longterm institutional repo borrowings all the prepayments were funded by excess cash liquidity at the bank see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our borrowed funds other noninterest expense increased million and million f or the three and nine months ended september respectively as compared to the same periods of these increases were largely due to higher data processing costs oreo related expenses as well as incrementally higher operating expenses in several categories due to the expansion of our

efficiency ratio measures total noninterest expense as a percentage of net interest income plus total noninterest income we believe this nongaap measure provides a meaningful comparison of our operational performance and facilitates investors assessments of business performance and trends in comparison to our peers in the banking industry our overall efficiency ratio and its comparability to some of our peers is negatively impacted primarily by the amortization of tax credit investments as well as infrequent charges within noninterest income and expense including but not limited to

quarter and third quarter respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter and the third quarter was mainly due to the increase in excess stock compensation benefit us gaap requires that any change in judgment or change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period be recognized as a discrete event in the quarter in which it occurs rather than being recognized as a change in effective tax rate for the current year our adherence to these tax guidelines may result in volatile effective income tax rates in future quarterly and annual periods factors that could impact managements judgment include changes in income tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies for the remainder of we currently estimate that our effective tax rate will range from percent to percent business segments we have four business segments that we monitor and report on to manage our business operations these segments are consumer lending commercial lending investment management and corporate and other adjustments our reportable segments have been determined based upon valleys internal structure of operations and lines of business each business segment is reviewed routinely for its asset growth contribution to income before income taxes and return on average interest earning assets and impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount expenses related to the branch network all other components of retail banking along with the back office departments of the bank are allocated from the corporate and other adjustments segment to each of the other three business segments interest expense and internal transfer expense for general corporate expenses are allocated to each business segment utilizing a transfer pricing methodology which involves the allocation of operating and funding costs based on each segments respective mix of average earning assets andor liabilities outstanding for the period the financial reporting for each segment contains allocations and reporting in line with our operations which may not necessarily be comparable to any other financial institution the accounting for each segment includes internal accounting policies designed to measure consistent and reasonable financial reporting and may result in income and expense measurements that differ from amounts under us gaap furthermore changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data the following tables present the financial data for each business segment for the three months ended september and three months ended september consumer lending commercial lending investment management

september consumer lending commercial lending investment management corporate and other adjustments total in thousands average interest earning assets income loss before income taxes annualized return on average interest earning assets before tax na see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information consumer lending this consumer lending segment represented percent of our loan portfolio at september and was mainly comprised of residential mortgage loans and automobile loans and to a lesser extent home equity loans secured personal lines of credit and other consumer loans including credit card loans the duration of the residential mortgage loan portfolio which represented percent of our loan portfolio at september is subject to movements in the market level of interest rates and forecasted prepayment speeds the weighted average life of the automobile loans representing percent of total loans at september is relatively unaffected by movements in the market level of interest rates however the average life may be impacted by new loans as a result of the availability of credit within the automobile marketplace and consumer demand for purchasing new or used automobiles the consumer lending segment also includes the wealth management and insurance services division comprised of trust asset management and insurance services average interest earning assets in this segment increased million to billion for the three months ended september as compared to the third quarter the increase was largely due to loan growth from origination of new residential mortgage loans and automobile loans over most of the last 12month period income before income taxes generated by the consumer lending segmen t increased million to million for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter largely due to a million decrease in the provision for loan losses and lower noninterest expense partially offset by a million decrease in noninterest income coupled with a million increase in the internal transfer expense the decrease of million in noninterest income was partly due to a million decrease in net gains on sales of loans for the three months ended september the decrease in the provision for loan losses was mainly due to the improvement in the economic forecast component of the allowance for loan losses at september as compared to september see further details in the allowance for credit losses section of this mda the net interest margin on the consumer lending portfolio decreased basis points to percent for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter mainly due to a basis point decrease in the yield on average loans partially offset by a basis point decrease in the costs associated with our funding sources the basis point decrease in loan yield was largely due to lower yielding new loan volumes and normal loan repayments the decrease in our funding costs was mainly due to continued runoff of higher cost time deposits some customer migration to lower cost deposits without stated maturities and lower rates offered on deposit products see the executive summary and the net interest income sections above for more details on our net interest margin and funding sources commercial lending the commercial lending segment is comprised of floating rate and adjustable rate commercial and industrial loans and construction loans as well as fixed rate owner occupied and commercial real estate loans due to the portfolios interest rate characteristics commercial lending is valleys business segment that is most sensitive to movements in market interest rates commercial and industrial loans totaled approximately billion and represented percent of the total loan portfolio at september commercial real estate loans and construction loans totaled billion and represented percent of the total loan portfolio at september average interest earning assets in this segment decreased approximately million to billion for the three months ended september as compared to the third quarter mostly due to commercial and industrial ppp loans which were paid off forgiven largely offset by strong new loan originations concentrated in the commercial real estate loan portfolio for the three months ended september income before income taxes for the commercial lending segment increased million to million as compared to the third quarter mainly driven by a million increase in net interest income and a million decrease in the provision for loan losses partially offset by lower noninterest income and higher internal expense net interest income for this segment increased to million for the third quarter as compared to the same period in primarily due to lower funding costs the provision for loan losses decreased by million mainly due to the improvement in the economic forecast component of the allowance for loan losses as compared to september noninterest income decreased million to million for the three months ended september as compared to the third quarter mainly due to a million decrease in swap fee income related to derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial loan customers internal transfer expense increased million for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter partly due to general increases related to organic growth in our business the net interest margin for this segment increased basis points to percent for the third quarter as compared to the third quarter due to a basis point decrease in the cost of our funding sources which was marginally offset by a basis point decrease in the yield on average loans i nvestment management the investment management segment generates a large portion of our income through investments in various types of securities and interestbearing deposits with other banks these investments are mainly comprised of fixed rate securities and depending on our liquid cash position federal funds sold and interestbearing deposits with banks primarily the federal reserve bank of new york as part of our assetliability management strategies the fixed rate investments are one of valleys least sensitive assets to changes in market interest rates however a portion of the investment portfolio is invested in shorterduration securities to maintain the overall asset sensitivity of our balance sheet see the assetliability management section below for further analysis average interest earning assets in this segment increased million during the third quarter as compared to the third quarter due to a million increase in average interest bearing deposits with banks partially offset by a million decrease in average investment securities the increase in overnight investments and deposits with other banks was largely due to our higher levels of excess liquidity during the third quarter as we continued to experience a surge in customer deposits the decrease in average investment securities was mainly driven by principal repayments on securities with a slower rate of reinvestment activity due to the low interest rate environment and our preference to fund loan growth however average investments did increase million as compared to the linked second quarter as we modestly increased our investment purchases in the third quarter during the second quarter income before income taxes for the investment management segment increased million to million as compared to million for the third quarter mostly due to an increase in both net interest income and noninterest income partially offset by higher internal transfer expense the increase in net interest income totaled thousand and was mainly due to the decreased cost of funding partially offset by lower yields on our investments securities and lower average investment balances noninterest income increased million in the third quarter as compared to the third quarter mainly due to higher bank owned life insurance income see the noninterest income section for more details the net interest margin for this segment decreased basis points to percent for the third quarter as compared to the same quarter in largely due to a basis point decrease in the yield on average investments partially offset by a basis point decrease in our cost of funding the decrease in the yield on average investments as compared to the third quarter was largely driven by the lower yielding investment securities and the higher average holdings in low yielding overnight cash investments corporate and other adjustments the amounts disclosed as corporate and other adjustments represent income and expense items not directly attributable to a specific segment including net securities gains and losses not reported in the investment management segment above interest expense related to subordinated notes amortization and impairment of tax credit investments as well as noncore items including merger expenses the corporate segment recognized pretax losses of million an d million for the three months ended september and respectively the million increase in the pretax loss for the third quarter was mainly driven by the million increase in noninterest expense largely caused by higher salaries and employee benefits expense and professional and legal fees for the three months ended september these items were partially offset by increases of million and million in noninterest income and internal transfer income respectively see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda the following tables present the financial data

before tax na consumer lending average interest earning assets in this segment decreased million to billion for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in the decrease was largely due to runoff from principal repayments with a higher percentage of new and refinanced mortgage loans originated for sale rather than held for investment over the last month period however automobile loan demand which was tempered during much of due to the onset of the covid19 pandemic was strong during the nine months ended september due to built up demand for auto purchases by consumers income before income taxes generated by the consumer lending segment increased million to million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in largely due to a lower provision for loan losses and noninterest expense and an increase in net interest income the provision for loan losses decreased million to a credit negative provision of million for the nine months ended september from a million provision for the same period of the lower provision was mainly due to the improved economic forecast component of the allowance for loan losses as compared to september as well as better actual loan performance within these loan categories see further details in the allowance for credit losses section of this mda net interest income increased million primarily due to the lower funding costs which were partially offset by lower loan yields as well as the modest decline in average interest earning assets the higher net interest income was partially offset by a million decrease in noninterest income which was largely attributable to lower net gains on sales of loans for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in the net interest margin on the consumer lending portfolio increased basis points to percent for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period one year ago mainly due to a basis point decrease in the costs associated with our funding sources partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield on average loans the decrease in our funding costs was mainly due to a greater mix of noninterest bearing deposits deposits continuing to reprice at lower interest rates and the repayment of maturing higher cost borrowings the basis point decrease in loan yield was largely due to lower yielding new loan volumes and normal loan repayments commercial lending average interest earning assets in this segment increased billion to billion for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in this increase was mainly due to ppp loan originations during the last months as well as organic commercial real estate loan growth during the nine months ended september for the nine months ended september income before income taxes for the commercial lending segment increased million to million as compared to the same period in mainly driven by an increase in net interest income and a lower

in noninterest inc ome as well as higher noninterest expense and internal transfer expense noninterest income decreased million for the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in

segment increased million during the nine months ended september as compared to the same period in within the category a million increase in average interest bearing deposits with banks was largely offset by million decrease in average investment securities the increase in our excess liquidity held in overnight interest bearing deposits with banks was mainly caused by strong deposits growth over the 12month period and managements lower rate of reinvestment in investment securities for most of the same period for the nine months ended september income before income taxes for the investment management segment decreased million to million as compared to the same period in mainly due to decreases in the net interest income and noninterest income and a higher internal expense transfer the negative impact of these items was partially offset by a decline in the provision for credit losses for held to maturity debt securities from a thousand provision for the nine months ended september

sensitivity our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to the movement in interest rates our assetliability management committee is responsible for managing such risks and establishing policies that monitor and coordinate our sources and uses of funds assetliability management is a continuous process due to the constant change in interest rate risk factors in assessing the appropriate interest rate risk levels for us management weighs the potential benefit of each risk management activity within the desired parameters of liquidity capital levels and managements tolerance for exposure to income fluctuations many of the actions undertaken by management utilize fair value analysis and attempt to achieve consistent accounting and economic benefits for financial assets and their related funding sources we have predominantly focused on managing our interest rate risk by attempting to match the inherent risk and cash flows of financial assets and liabilities specifically management employs multiple risk management activities such as optimizing the level of new residential mortgage originations retained in our mortgage portfolio through increasing or decreasing loan sales in the secondary market product pricing levels the desired maturity levels for new originations the composition levels of both our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as several other risk management activities we use a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a 12month and 24month period the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumptions of certain assets and liabilities as of september the model assumes immediate changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the composition or size of the balance sheet or other future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk in the model the forecasted shape of the yield curve remains static as of september the impact of interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps is also included in the model our simulation model is based on market interest rates and prepayment speeds prevalent in the market as of september although the size of valleys balance sheet is forecasted to remain static as of september in our model the composition is adjusted to reflect new interest earning assets and funding originations coupled with rate spreads utilizing our actual originations during the third quarter the model also utilizes an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates at september the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the table below due to the frequency and timing of changes in interest rates and changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories overall our net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios we actively manage these cash flows in conjunction with our liability mix duration and interest rates to optimize the net interest income while structuring the balance sheet in response to actual or potential changes in interest rates additionally our net interest income is impacted by the level of competition within our marketplace competition can negatively impact the level of interest rates attainable on loans and increase the cost of deposits which may result in downward pressure on our net interest margin in future periods other factors including but not limited to the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows will impact our net interest income results and may increase or decrease the level of asset sensitivity of our balance sheet convexity is a measure of how the duration of a financial instrument changes as market interest rates change potential movements in the convexity of bonds held in our investment portfolio as well as the duration of the loan portfolio may have a positive or negative impact on our net interest income in varying interest rate environments as a result the increase or decrease in forecasted net interest income may not have a linear relationship to the results reflected in the table below management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income the following table reflects managements expectations of the change in our net interest income over the next month period considering the aforementioned assumptions while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this simulation model we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact than shown in the table below estimated change in future net interest income changes in interest rates dollar change percentage change in basis points in thousands as noted in the table above a basis point immediate increase in interest rates combined with a static balance sheet where the size mix and proportions of assets and liabilities remain unchanged is projected to increase net interest income over the next month period by percent management believes the interest rate sensitivity remains within an acceptable tolerance range at september however the level of net interest income sensitivity may increase or decrease in the future as a result of several factors including potential changes in our balance sheet strategies the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows liquidity and cash requirements bank liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due a banks liquidity reflects its ability to meet loan demand to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate opportunities in the marketplace liquidity management is carefully performed and routinely reported by our treasury department to two board committees among other actions treasury reviews historical funding requirements current liquidity position sources and stability of funding marketability of assets options for attracting additional funds and anticipated future funding needs including the level of unfunded commitments our goal is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover current and potential funding requirements the bank has no required regulatory liquidity ratios to maintain however it adheres to an internal liquidity policy the current policy maintains that we may not have a ratio of loans to deposits in ex cess of percent or reliance on wholesale funding greater than percent of total funding the bank was in compliance with the foregoing policies at september valleys short and longterm cash requirements include contractual obligations under borrowings deposits payment related to leases capital expenditures and other purchase commitments in the ordinary course of operations the bank also enters into various financial obligations including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments management believes the bank has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its shortterm and longterm obligations as they come due by utilizing various cash resources described below on the asset side of the balance sheet the bank has numerous sources of liquid funds in the form of cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits with banks including the federal reserve bank of new york investment securities held to maturity that are maturing within days or would otherwise qualify as maturities if sold ie percent of original cost basis has been repaid investment securities classified as trading and available for sale loans held for sale and from time to time federal funds sold and receivables related to unsettled securities transactions total liquid assets were approximate ly billion representing percent of earning assets at september and billion representing percent of earning assets at december of the billion of liquid assets at september approximately million of various investment securities were pledged to counterparties to support our earning asset funding strategies we anticipate the receipt of approx imately million in principal payments from securities in the total investment portfolio over the next month period due to normally scheduled principal repayments and expected prepayments of certain securities primarily residential mortgagebacked securities additional liquidity is derived from scheduled loan payments of principal and interest as well as prepayments received loan principal payments including loans held for sale at september are projected in accordance with their scheduled contractual terms to be approximately billion over the next month period as a contingency plan for any liquidity constraints liquidity could also be derived from the sale of conforming residential mortgages from our loan portfolio or alleviated from the temporary curtail ment of lending activities on the liability side of the balance sheet we utilize multiple sources of funds to meet liquidity needs including retail and commercial deposits brokered and municipal deposits and shortterm and longterm borrowings our core deposit base which generally excludes fully insured brokered deposits and both retail and brokered certificates of deposit over thousand represents the largest of these sources average core deposits totaled approximately billion and billion for the nine months ended september and for the year ended december respectively representing percent and percent of average earning assets for the respective periods the level of interest bearing deposits is affected by interest rates offered which is often influenced by our need for funds and the need to match the maturities of assets and liabilities additional funding may be provided through deposit gathering networks and in the form of federal funds purchased through our well established relationships with numerous banks while these lending lines are uncommitted management believes that the bank could borrow approximately billion from these banks on a collective basis the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb and has the ability to borrow from them in the form of fhlb advances secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral including but not limited to us government and agency mortgagebacked securities and a blanket assignment of qualifying first lien mortgage loans consisting of both residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans additionally valleys collateral pledged to the fhlb may be used to obtain municipal letters of credit muloc to collateralize certain municipal deposits held by valley at september valley had billion of mulocs outstanding for this purpose furthermore we can obtain overnight borrowings from the federal reserve bank of new york via the discount window as a contingency for additional liquidity at september our borrowing capacity excluding added capacity available to us by pledging ppp loans under the federal reserve banks discount window was billion we also have access to other shortterm and longterm borrowing sources to support our asset base such as repos ie securities sold under agreements to repurchase shortterm borrowings consisting of fhlb advances repos and from time to time federal funds purchased decreased approximately million to million at september as compared to december due to normal fhlb advance repayments corporation liquidity valleys recurring cash requirements primarily consist of dividends to preferred and common shareholders and interest expense on subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts as part of our ongoing assetliability management strategies valley could also use cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock under its share repurchase program or redeem its callable junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes valleys cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the bank projected cash flows from the bank are expected to be adequate to pay preferred and common dividends if declared and interest expense payable to subordinated note holders and capital trusts given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of the bank in addition to dividends received from the bank valley can satisfy its cash requirements by utilizing its own cash and potential new funds borrowed from outside sources or capital issuances valley also has the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarterly periods up to five years but not beyond the stated maturity dates and subject to other conditions during the second quarter valley redeemed million of callable subordinated notes and issued million of percent subordinated notes see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information investment securities portfolio as of september we had million million billion and billion in equity trading debt available for sale and held to maturity debt securities respectively our trading securities portfolio wholly consists of investment grade municipal bonds the equity securities consisted of one publicly traded mutual fund cra investments and several other equity investments we have made in companies that develop new financial technologies and in a partnership that invests in such companies our cra and other equity investments are a mixture of both publicly traded entities and privately held entities held to maturity and available for sale debt securities portfolios include us treasury securities us government agency securities taxexempt and taxable issuances of states and political subdivisions residential mortgagebacked securities singleissuer trust preferred securities principally issued by bank holding companies and high quality corporate bonds among other securities our available for sale debt securities include securities such as bank issued and other corporate bonds as well as municipal special revenue bonds that may pose a higher risk of future impairment charges to us as a result of the uncertain economic environment and its potential negative effect on the future performance of the security issuers there were no securities in the name of any one issuer exceeding percent of shareholders equity except for residential mortgagebacked securities issued by ginnie mae and fannie mae certain securities with limited marketability andor restrictions such as federal home loan bank and federal reserve bank stocks are carried at cost and are included in other assets allowance for credit losses and impairment analysis available for sale debt securities available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly in assessing whether a credit loss exists we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded limited to the amount the fair value is less than amortized cost basis declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses such as declines due to changes in market interest rates are recorded through other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes we have evaluated all available for sale debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of september and determined that the declines in fair value are mainly attributable to changes in market volatility due to factors such as interest rates and spread factors but not attributable to credit quality or other factors based on a comparison of the present value of expected cash flows to the amortized cost management recognized no impairment charges during the three and nine months ended september and as a result there was no allowance for credit losses for available for sale debt securities at september there was no allowance for credit losses for available for sale debt securities at december held to maturity debt securities valley estimates the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third party valley has a zero loss expectation for certain securities within the held to maturity portfolio including us treasury securities us agency securities residential mortgagebacked securities issued by ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac and collateralized municipal bonds which are excluded from the model assumptions used in the model for pools of securities with common risk characteristics include the historical lifetime probability of default and severity of loss in the event of default with the model incorporating several economic cycles of loss history data to calculate expected credit losses given default at the individual security level held to maturity debt securities were carried net of allowance for credit losses totaling million and million at september and december respectively there were no net chargeoffs of held to maturity debt securities for the three and nine months ended september and investment grades the investment grades in the table below reflect the most current independent analysis performed by third parties of each security as of the date presented and not necessarily the investment grades at the date of our purchase of the securities for many securities the rating agencies may not have performed an independent analysis of the tranches owned by us but rather an analysis of the entire investment pool for this and other reasons we believe the assigned investment grades may not accurately reflect the actual credit quality of each security and should not be viewed in isolation as a measure of the quality of our investment portfolio the following table presents the held to maturity and available for sale debt securities portfolios by investment grades at september september amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value in thousands available for sale investment grades aaa rated aa rated a

included million million million million and million of net unearned fees related to ppp loans at september june march december and september respectively commercial and industrial loans decreased million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at september as compared to june mostly due to million of ppp loans that were forgiven ie repaid during the third quarter as of september nearly percent of the ppp loan balances from the first two rounds of our funding under the sba program have been forgiven valley expects the majority of the remaining million of ppp loans on september to qualify for forgiveness under the guidelines of the sba program which is expected to negatively impact our ability to grow the commercial and industrial loan portfolio nonppp commercial and industrial loans modestly increased by million at september as compared to june commercial real estate loans excluding construction loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at september from june reflecting solid organic growth mainly due to strong demand for nonowner occupied loans across our geographic footprint driven by low interest rates construction loans increased million to billion at september from june partially due to higher demand for commercial and residential construction projects residential mortgage loans increased million or percent on an annualized basis during the third quarter due to continued strong origination of new and refinanced residential mortgage loans totaling million for the third quarter as compared to million and million for the second quarter and third quarter respectively florida originations totaled approximately million and represented percent of total originations of the total originations in the third quarter approximately million of residential mortgage loans were originated for sale rather than held for investment as compared to million during the second quarter during the third quarter we retained over percent of the total residential mortgages originations in our held for investment loan portfolio we sold approximately million of residential mortgage loans held for sale during the third quarter and may continue to sell a large portion of our new fixed rate residential mortgage loan originations during the fourth quarter based upon normal management of the interest rate risk and mix of the interest earning assets on our balance sheet home equity loans decreased by million to million at september from june new home equity loan volumes and customer usage of existing home equity lines of credit continue to be modest despite the favorable low interest rate environment automobile loans increased by million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at september as compared to june consumer demand seen across the auto industry was solid during the first half of but started to slow in the third quarter we originated million in auto loans through our dealership network during the third quarter as compared to million in the second quarter of the total originations our florida dealership network contributed million in auto loan originations representing approximately percent of new loans during the third quarter strong auto loan originations experienced in the first half of slowed during the third quarter due to inventory and auto part shortages caused by supply chain disruptions affecting auto industry in the early stages of the fourth quarter vehicle inventories are near record lows driving prices higher this trend may negatively impact our auto loan growth in fourth quarter and beyond other consumer loans increased million to million at september as compared to million at june mainly due to higher new loan originations and consumer usage of collateralized personal lines of credit most of our lendin g is in northern and central new jersey new york city long island florida and alabama except for smaller auto and residential mortgage loan portfolios derived from other neighboring states of new jersey to mitigate our geographic risks we make efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to guard against a potential downward turn in any one economic sector for the remainder of we continue to believe that our nonppp loan growth will remain strong in the early stages of the fourth quarter we are encouraged that our loan origination pipelines remain robust during the third quarter approximately percent of our commercial real estate loan growth came from the new york and new jersey market area however there can be no assurance that those positive trends will continue or balances will not decline from september given the effects of the covid19 pandemic and the potential for unforeseen changes in consumer confidence and the economy and other market conditions and supply chain issues we believe that many of our sba ppp loans will continue to be forgiven in the fourth quarter in accordance with the rules of this program resulting in further reduction in these loan balances nonperforming assets nonperforming assets npa include nonaccrual loans other real estate owned oreo and other repossessed assets which primarily consists of automobiles and taxi medallions at september loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal or interest exceptions to the nonaccrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection oreo is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate oreo and other repossessed assets are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell our npas increased million to million at september as compared to june mainly due to a million increase in nonaccrual commercial real estate loans see table below npas as a percentage of total loans and npas totaled percent and percent at september and june respectively as shown in the table below we believe our total npas has remained relatively low as a percentage of the total loan portfolio over the past months despite the uptick in nonaccrual borrowers mainly caused by covid19 pandemic the level of npas is reflective of our consistent approach to the loan underwriting criteria for both valley originated loans and loans purchased from third parties for additional details see the credit quality indicators section in note to the consolidated financial statements our lending strategy is based on underwriting standards designed to maintain high credit quality and we remain optimistic regarding the overall future performance of our loan portfolio however due to the potential for future credit deterioration caused by the uncertain path of the recovery from the covid pandemic and some of our borrowers that are still performing under forbearance agreements management cannot provide assurance that our nonperforming assets will not increase substantially from the levels reported at september the following table sets forth by loan category accruing past due and nonperforming assets at the dates indicated in conjunction with our asset

compared to june largely due to two loan relationships totaling million that migrated to nonaccrual loan status at september loans past due to days decreased million to million at september as compared to june commercial real estate loans in this delinquency category decreased million to million at september mainly as a result of one million loan negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic that migrated to nonaccrual status at september partially offset by the addition of a million matured commercial real estate loan in the process of renewal in this delinquency category at september loans past due days or more and still accruing interest totaled million at september as compared to million at june a ll of the loans past due days or more and still accruing reported at september are considered to be well secured and in the process of collection nonaccrual loans increased million to million at september as compared to million at june mostly driven by a million increase in the commercial real estate loans this increase was caused by two loans totaling million and one loan totaling million that migrated to nonaccrual status from the days and to days past due categories reported at june respectively these nonaccrual loans totaling million have allocated reserves of million within our allowance for loan losses at september we continue to closely monitor our nonperforming new york city and chicago taxi medallion loans totaling million and thousand respectively within the commercial and industrial loan category at september due to continued negative trends in estimated fair valuations of the underlying taxi medallion collateral a weak operating environment for ride services and uncertain borrower performance all of the taxi medallion loans are on nonaccrual status at september the taxi medallion loans totaling million had related reserves of million or percent of such loans the related reserves were relatively unchanged as compared to june potential declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions and the stressed operating environment mainly within new york city due to the covid19 pandemic could negatively impact the future performance of this portfolio for example a percent further decline in our current estimated market value of the taxi medallions would require additional allocated reserves of million within the allowance for loan losses based upon the taxi medallion loan balances at september see the allowance for credit losses section below for further details on our reserves oreo properties totaled million at september and declined thousand as compared to june net losses and gains from the sales of oreo properties to taled a thousand loss and a thousand net gain fo r the three and nine months ended

of approximately percent as compared to a premodification weighted average interest rate of percent loan forbearance in response to the c ovid19 pandemic and its economic impact on certain customers valley implemented shortterm loan modifications such as payment deferrals fee waivers extensions of repayment terms or delays in payment when requested by customers all of which were insignificant under the applicable guidance none of these loans were classified as tdrs at september and december the following table presents the outstanding loan b alances and number of loans in an active payment deferral period under shortterm modifications as of september september amount number of loans in thousands commercial and industrial commercial real estate residential mortgage consumer total as of september valley had approximately million of outstanding loans remaining in their payment deferral period under shortterm modifications as compared to million of loans in deferral at june commercial real estate forbearances representing approximately percent of the active deferrals at september decreased million from million at june mainly due to loans being returned to normal interest accrual status following the end of their forebearance periods during the third quarter allowance for credit losses for loans the allowance for credit losses acl for loans includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments under cecl our methodology to establish the allowance for loan losses has two basic components a collective reserve component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics and an individual reserve component for loans that do not share risk characteristics consisting of collateral dependent tdr and expected tdr loans valley also maintains a separate allowance for unfunded credit commitments mainly consisting of undisbursed noncancellable lines of credit new loan commitments and commercial standby letters of credit valley estimated the collective acl using a current expected credit losses methodology which is based on relevant information about historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the loan balances in estimating the component of the allowance on a collective basis we use a transition matrix model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan pool by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics the metrics are based on the migration of loans from performing to loss by credit quality rating or delinquency categories using historical lifeofloan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool and the severity of loss based on the aggregate net lifetime losses the models expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative factors among other things these adjustments include and account for differences in i the impact of the reasonable and supportable economic forecast relative probability weightings and reversion period ii other asset specific risks to the extent they do not exist in the historical loss information and iii net expected recoveries of charged off loan balances these adjustments are based on qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses the expected lifetime loss rate is the life of loan loss percentage from the transition matrix model plus the impact of the adjustments for qualitative factors the expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the models expected lifetime loss rate by the exposure at default at period end on an undiscounted basis valley utilizes a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a oneyear period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the loan on a straightline basis the forecasts consist of a multiscenario economic forecast model to estimate future credit losses and is governed by a crossfunctional committee the committee meets each quarter to determine which economic scenarios developed by moodys will be incorporated into the model as well as the relative probability weightings of the selected scenarios based upon all readily available information the model projects economic variables under each scenario based on detailed statistical analyses we have identified and selected key variables that most closely correlated to our historical credit performance which include gdp unemployment and the caseshiller home price index for the third quarter we continued to incorporate a probability weighted threescenario economic forecast including moodys baseline s3 and s1 scenarios at september valley maintained the majority of its weighting to the moodys baseline scenario and modestly reduced its combined emphasis on the moodys s3 downside and s1 upside scenarios as compared to june the baseline weighting and the s1 scenario reflect the positive economic developments including federal stimulus and increasing vaccination levels that are expected to improve labor market conditions and promote stronger economic growth during the remainder of however this positive outlook could still be tempered by among other factors the uncertain ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic on the economic recovery as well as supply chain constrains contributing to inventory shortages and longer than anticipated elevated levels of inflation at september the moodys baseline forecast included the following specific assumptions gdp expansion by over percent in the fourth quarter unemployment of percent in the fourth quarter and improving to percent by the third quarter and strong us economic growth driven by continued consumer spending and congressional passage of another fiscal stimulus package see more details regarding our allowance for credit losses for
