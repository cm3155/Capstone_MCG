below before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing valley additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently believes are immaterial may also impair valleys business operations the value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks and you could lose all or part of your investment this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors risks related to our pending merger with bank leumi usa valley is expected to incur significant costs related to the merger and integration valley has incurred and expects to incur certain nonrecurring costs associated with the pending merger these costs include legal financial advisory accounting consulting and other advisory fees severanceemployee benefitrelated costs public company filing fees and other regulatory fees printing costs and other related costs some of these costs are payable by valley regardless of whether or not the merger is completed valley is expected to incur substantial costs in connection with the integration of valley and bank leumi usa there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that may need to be integrated including purchasing accounting and finance payroll compliance treasury management vendor management risk management lines of business pricing and benefits valley has assumed that a certain level of costs will be incurred however there are many factors beyond valleys control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration costs moreover many of the costs that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these integration costs may result in valley taking charges against earnings following the completion of the merger and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present while valley provided an assumption about the amount and timing of cost synergies when it announced the merger those assumptions have not been updated and the amount of actual cost synergies may differ from amounts previously disclosed combining valley and bank leumi usa may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and valley may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from the merger valley and bank leumi usa must successfully integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits those synergies to be realized if valley and bank leumi usa are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected in addition the actual synergies and anticipated benefits of the merger could be less than anticipated and integration may result in additional unforeseen expenses valley and bank leumi usa have operated and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate independently the success of the merger will depend in part on valleys ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of both companies in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer relations or result in decreased revenue or reputational harm it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of either companys ongoing businesses difficulties in integrating operations and systems including communications systems administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger any disruption to either companys business could cause its customers to remove their accounts and move their business to a competing financial institution integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources these integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of valley and bank leumi usa during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger on valley table start form 10k table end valley may be unable to retain valley or bank leumi usa personnel successfully while the merger is pending or after the merger is completed the success of the merger will depend in part on valleys ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by valley and bank leumi usa it is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with valley or bank leumi usa as applicable while the merger is pending or with valley after the merger is consummated if valley and bank leumi usa are unable to retain key employees including management who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies valley and bank leumi usa could face disruptions in their operations loss of existing customers loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment costs in addition if key employees terminate their employment valleys business activities may be adversely affected and managements attention may be diverted from successfully integrating valley and bank leumi usa to hiring suitable replacements all of which may cause valleys or bank leumi usas businesses to suffer in addition valley and bank leumi usa may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company regulatory approvals may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on valley following the merger various consents approvals and authorizations must be obtained from certain governmental authorities as a condition to closing of the merger these approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all including due to any or all of the following an adverse development in either partys or its affiliates regulatory standing or any other factors considered by regulators in granting such approvals governmental political or community group inquiries investigations or opposition or changes in legislation or the political environment including as a result of changes in regulatory agency leadership even if the specified regulatory approvals are granted they may impose terms and conditions limitations obligations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of valleys business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions limitations obligations or restrictions and that such conditions limitations obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of valley following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe in addition there can be no assurance that any such conditions limitations obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger the market price of valley common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of valley common stock currently valleys business differs from that of bank leumi usa accordingly the results of operations of valley and the market price of valley common stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of valley and bank leumi usa the future results of valley following the merger may suffer if valley does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the merger the size of the business of valley will increase beyond its current size valleys future success will depend in part upon its ability to manage this expanded business which may pose challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity valley may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the increase in the size of its business there can be no assurances that valley will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the merger bank leumi usa is subject to regulatory risks in connection with its international private banking business and these risks may adversely affect valley after completion of the merger bank leumi usa operates a private banking business with domestic clients and international clients primarily domiciled in latin america the risk of noncompliance with the usa patriot act the bank secrecy act and other antimoney laundering laws and regulations collectively aml laws and the rules of the us treasury departments office of foreign assets control ofac can be heightened for financial institutions that have a significant number of international customers and can be particularly acute for financial institutions that have a significant number of customers from or do business in latin america aml laws and ofac rules and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision table start form 10k table end following the completion of the merger valley will be responsible for maintaining a compliance program that is effective in combating the increased legal and regulatory risks associated with bank leumi usas international private banking business valley will evaluate on an ongoing basis whether enhancements are appropriate so that valley continues to maintain an effective compliance program following the completion of the merger valley may not be able to eliminate all attempts by customers to use valley to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities if valleys policies procedures and systems are deemed deficient or fail to prevent violations of applicable laws or regulations the occ along with other banking agencies have the authority to impose fines and other penalties and sanctions on valley and valleys business and reputation could suffer failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on valleys business results of operations and financial condition bank leumi usa and its subsidiaries are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings the results of which could have an adverse effect on valley after completion of the merger bank leumi usa and its subsidiaries are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings and may from time to time be involved in government and regulatory investigations and inquiries relating to matters that arise in connection with the conduct of their businesses for example bank leumi usa is a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the district of columbia captioned bassem altamimi et al v sheldon adelson et al docket no 116cv00445 the plaintiffs both palestinian nationals and palestinian americans generally allege that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to expel all nonjews from a territory in the middle east bank leumi usa believes that this lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend against this action vigorously however the ultimate outcome of this matter any future similar matters and any other legal proceedings in which bank leumi usa is or may become involved cannot be predicted with certainty adverse judgments fines or penalties in one or more of the legal proceedings in which bank leumi usa and its subsidiaries are or may become involved could have a material adverse effect on valleys business financial condition or results of operations risks related to the covid19 pandemic we anticipate that the covid19 pandemic will continue to adversely affect us and our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers the full extent and duration of the adverse impacts on our business financial position results of operations and prospects are currently unknown and could be significant the spread of covid19 has created a global publichealth crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility and deterioration in business economic and market conditions and household incomes including in the states of new jersey new york florida and alabama where we conduct nearly all of our business the extent of the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic on our capital and liquidity and on our business results of operations financial position and prospects generally will depend on a number of evolving factors including t he duration extent and severity of the pandemic covid19 has not yet been contained and could affect significantly more households and businesses the duration and severity of the pandemic future resurgences of covid19 including the delta and omicron variants and any future variants in our primary market areas the efficacy of vaccines and the timing of the distribution and public acceptance of such vaccines or other treatments continue to be impossible to predict there remains substantial uncertainty surrounding the pace of economic recovery and the return of business and consumer confidence the response of governmental and nongovernmental authorities while many responsive measures such as curtailing household and business activity to contain covid19 and deploying fiscal and monetarypolicy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses have been eliminated or curtailed due to the availability of vaccines we cannot predict whether such measures will be reintroduced furthermore vaccine and mask mandates throughout our market areas are inconsistent and may inhibit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel these measures are not always coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions we cannot predict whether and to what extent governmental and nongovernmental authorities will continue to implement policy measures to assist us and our customers and the failure to do so could have adverse effects on our business the effect on our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers covid19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties including inflationary pressure supply chain challenges unemployment labor market shortages and vaccine mandates are affecting individuals households and businesses differently and unevenly and we anticipate will continue to do so as a result our credit operational and other risks have generally increased and for the foreseeable future are expected to remain elevated or increase further the effect on economies and markets whether current andor future actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of covid19 in the future is unclear national regional and local economies including the local economies in the markets areas which we serve recovered in but could deteriorate in table start form 10k table end and beyond due to the delta and omicron variants and any future variants markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting governmental actions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we can provide no assurance that governmental or nongovernmental mitigation efforts will continue or be effective in the future in our provision expense for credit losses decreased significantly as compared to however with recent increases in covid19 infection rates in our market areas the level of our provision expense remains subject to meaningful uncertainty governments have taken unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their containment measures for example on march the cares act was enacted to inject more than trillion of financial assistance into the us economy the frb has taken decisive and sweeping actions as well since march these have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of treasury securities and agency mortgagebacked securities and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses however given the increase in inflation in it is expected that the frb will raise interest rates and wind down us treasury securities purchases in while there is evidence that our actions and those of governments and others have assisted our customers counterparties and thirdparty service providers and advanced our business and the economy generally it is uncertain what the effect will be once those policies are discontinued for example while the frbs monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by supporting economic activity among our customers this policy and sudden shifts may inhibit our ability to grow or sustain net interest income and effectively manage interest rate risk in order to safeguard the health and wellness of our customers and employees and to comply with applicable government directives we modified our business practices while many of these restrictions were lifted in we still have not lifted all safeguards and we may choose or be required to implement new restrictions in the future including vaccine and mask mandates these measures and further actions we may take as required by government authorities or that we otherwise determine are in the best interests of our customers and employees could increase certain risks including cybersecurity risks impair our ability to perform critical functions and adversely impact our results of operations we are unable to estimate the nearterm and ultimate impacts of covid19 on our business and operations at this time the pandemic could cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio additional increases in our allowance for credit losses impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets diminished access to capital markets and other funding sources further reduced demand for our products and services and other negative impacts on our financial position results of operations and prospects in addition sustained adverse effects may impair our capital and liquidity positions require us to take capital actions prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements result in downgrades in our credit ratings and the reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend in future periods we may be required to consult with the federal reserve bank frb before declaring cash dividends on our common stock which ultimately may delay reduce or eliminate such dividends and adversely affect the market price of our common stock holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so we may reduce or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future depending upon our results of operations financial condition or other metrics which could be adversely impacted by the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic which remains unknown in july the frb updated its supervisory guidance to provide greater clarity regarding the situations in which bank holding companies like valley may expect an expedited consultation in connection with the declaration of dividends that exceed quarterly earnings to qualify amongst other criteria total commercial real estate loan concentrations cannot represent percent or more of total capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio cannot increase by percent or more during the prior months currently we believe that valley does not meet the standard for expedited consultation and approval of its dividend should it be required as a result valley could be subject to a lengthier and possibly more burdensome review process by the frb when considering paying dividends that exceed quarterly earnings the delay reduction or elimination of our quarterly dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock see additional information regarding our quarterly cash dividend and the current rate of earnings retention in the capital adequacy section of the mda table start form 10k table end risks associated with our business model our investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations we invest in certain taxadvantaged investments that support qualified affordable housing projects community development and prior to renewable energy resources our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits over specified time periods third parties perform diligence on these investments for us on which we rely both at inception and on an ongoing basis we are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level may fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and may not be able to be realized the possible inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits may have a negative impact on our financial results the risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside our control including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed we previously invested in mobile solar generators sold and leased back by dc solar and its affiliates dc solar dc solar had its assets frozen in december by the us department of justice dc solar and related entities are in chapter bankruptcy a group of investors who purchased mobile solar generators from and leased them back to dc solar including us received tax credits for making these renewable resource investments during the fourth quarter several of the coconspirators pleaded guilty to fraud in the ongoing federal investigation based upon this new information valley deemed that its tax positions related to the dc solar funds did not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold in valleys tax reserve assessment at december as a result our net income for the year ended december included an increase to our provision for income taxes of million reflecting the reserve for uncertain tax liability positions related to tax credits and other tax benefits previously recognized from the investments in the dc solar funds plus interest the principals pled guilty to fraud in early during the internal revenue service commenced an audit connected with our investment in dc solar while we believe that valley was fully reserved for the tax positions related to dc solar at december we continue to evaluate all our existing tax positions each quarter under us gaap we recently implemented new deposit services for businesses in the state licensed cannabis industry which could expose us to additional liabilities and regulatory compliance costs in we implemented specialized deposit services intended for a limited number of state licensed medicaluse cannabis business customers medical use cannabis as well as recreational use businesses are legal in numerous states and the district of columbia including our primary markets of new jersey new york and florida however such businesses are not legal at the federal level and cannabis remains a schedule i drug under the controlled substances act of in the us department of the treasurys financial crimes enforcement network fincen published guidelines for financial institutions servicing state legal cannabis businesses we have implemented a comprehensive control framework that includes written policies and procedures related to the onboarding of such businesses and the monitoring and maintenance of such business accounts that comports with the fincen guidance additionally our policies call for due diligence review of the cannabis business before the business is onboarded including confirmation that the business is properly licensed and maintains the license in good standing in the applicable state throughout the relationship our policies call for continued monitoring of the business including site visits to determine if the business continues to meet our requirements including maintenance of required licenses and calls for undertaking periodic financial reviews of the business the banks program originally was limited to offering depository products to medical cannabis businesses deposit transactions are monitored for compliance with the applicable state medical program rules and other regulations before approval and acceptance by the banks bsaaml department more recently the bank has agreed to limited lending on real estate and expanded to licensed recreational dispensaries the bank may offer additional banking products and services to such customers in the future while we believe our policies and procedures will allow us to operate in compliance with the fincen guidelines there can be no assurance that compliance with the fincen guidelines will protect us from federal prosecution or other regulatory sanctions federal prosecutors have significant discretion and there can be no assurance that the federal prosecutors will not choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis any change in the federal governments enforcement position could potentially subject us to criminal prosecution and other regulatory sanctions while we also believe our bsaaml policies and programs for this new business are sufficient the medical and recreational cannabis business is considered highrisk thus increasing the risk of a regulatory action against our bsaaml program that has adverse consequences including but not limited to preventing us from undertaking mergers acquisitions and other expansion activities table start form 10k table end the loss of or decrease in lowercost funding sources within our deposit base including our inability to achieve deposit retention targets under our branch transformation strategy may adversely impact our net interest income and net income checking and savings now and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments such as the stock market or money market or fixed income mutual funds as providing a better riskreturn tradeoff additionally our customers largely bank with us because of our local customer service and convenience for certain customers this convenience could be negatively impacted by recent branch consolidation activity undergone as part of our branch transformation strategy if customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments valley could lose a lowcost source of funds increasing its funding costs and reducing valleys net interest income and net income a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate and events that negatively impact the real estate market could adversely affect our asset quality and profitability for those loans secured by real property and increase the number of defaults and the level of losses within our loan portfolio a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate as of december approximately percent of our total loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and could deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended a downturn in the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values our earnings and shareholders equity could be adversely affected any declines in home or commercial real estate prices in the new jersey new york and florida markets we primarily serve along with the unpredictable longterm impact and path of the economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic also may result in increases in delinquencies and losses in our loan portfolios unexpected decreases in home or commercial real estate prices coupled with slow economic growth and elevated levels of unemployment could drive losses beyond those which are provided for in our allowance for loan losses in that event our earnings could be adversely affected we could incur future goodwill impairment if our estimates of the fair value of our goodwill change as a result of changes in our business or other factors we may determine a goodwill impairment charge is necessary estimates of the fair value of goodwill are determined using several factors and assumptions including but not limited to industry pricing multiples and estimated cash flows based upon valleys goodwill impairment testing the fair values of its four reporting units wealth management consumer lending commercial lending and investment management were in excess of their carrying values no assurance can be given that we will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in the future and any such impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition at december our goodwill totaled billion see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information our market share and income may be adversely affected by our inability to successfully compete against larger and more diverse financial service providers digital fintech startup firms and other financial services providers which have advanced technological capabilities valley faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than valley to deal with the potential negative changes in the financial markets and regulatory landscape many of these competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints broader geographic service areas greater capital and in some cases lower cost structures valley competes with other providers of financial services such as commercial and savings banks savings and loan associations credit unions money market and mutual funds mortgage companies title agencies asset managers insurance companies and a large list of other local regional and national institutions which offer financial services additionally the financial services industry is facing a wave of digital disruption from fintech companies and other large financial services providers the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services which increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs these competitors provide innovative webbased solutions to traditional retail banking services and products fintech companies tend to have stronger operating efficiencies and fewer regulatory burdens than their traditional bank counterparts including valley regulatory changes may continue to allow new entrants into the markets in which we operate the result of these regulatory changes will likely cause other nontraditional financial services companies to compete directly with valley many table start form 10k table end of the companies have stronger operating efficiencies and fewer regulatory burdens than their traditional bank counterparts including valley our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as a result of covid19 customers have become more reliant on and their expectations have increased with respect to this technology we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers and service interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws many of valleys competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements valley may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on valleys business and in turn valleys financial condition and results of operations failure to successfully implement our growth strategies could cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses which may not be recouped and adversely affect our future profitability from time to time valley may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed valley may invest significant time and resources to develop and market new lines of business andor products and services initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting customer preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service additionally any new line of business andor new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of valleys system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on valleys business results of operations and financial condition we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property during the ordinary course of business we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans in doing so there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if hazardous or toxic substances are found we may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property in addition future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review prior to originating certain commercial real estate loans as well as before initiating any foreclosure action on real property these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we may incur future losses in connection with repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market we engage in the origination of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market while typically retaining the loan servicing in connection with such sales we make representations and warranties which if breached may require us to repurchase such loans substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans the aggregate principal balances of residential mortgage loans serviced by the bank for others approximated billion and billion at december and respectively over the past several years we have experienced a nominal amount of repurchase requests and only a few of which have actually resulted in repurchases by valley only five and two loan repurchases in and respectively none of the loan repurchases resulted in a material loss as of december no reserves pertaining to loans sold were established on our financial statements while we currently believe our repurchase risk remains low based upon our careful loan underwriting and documentation standards it is possible that requests to repurchase loans could occur in the future and such requests may have a negative financial impact on us table start form 10k table end net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans are a significant component of our noninterest income and could fluctuate in future periods net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans represented approximately percent and percent of our noninterest income for the years ended december and respectively our net gains on sales of loans for each period are comprised of both gains on sales of residential mortgages and the net change in the mark to market gains and losses on our loans held for sale carried at fair value at each period end our ability or decision to sell a portion of our mortgage loan production in the secondary market is dependent upon amongst other factors the levels of market interest rates consumer demand marketable loans our sales and pricing strategies the economy and our need to maintain the appropriate level of interest rate risk on our balance sheet a change in one or more of these or other factors could significantly impact our ability to sell mortgage loans in the future and adversely impact the level of our noninterest income and financial results we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them in particular due to an increasingly competitive labor market the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel including but not limited to the executive officers disclosed in item of this annual report could have a material adverse impact on our business because we would lose the employees skills knowledge of the market and years of industry experience and may have difficulty promptly finding qualified replacement personnel climate change and severe weather could significantly impact our ability to conduct our business there is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters the physical risks of climate change include discrete events such as flooding and wildfires and longerterm shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat seal level rise and more frequent and prolonged drought such events could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from market volatility additionally transitioning to a lowcarbon economy may entail extensive policy legal technology and market initiatives a significant portion of our primary markets is located near coastal waters which could generate naturally occurring severe weather or in response to climate change that could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business many areas in new jersey new york florida and alabama in which our branches operate are subject to severe flooding from time to time and significant disruptions related to the weather may become common events in the future heavy storms and hurricanes can also cause severe property damage and result in business closures negatively impacting both the financial health of retail and commercial customers and our ability to operate our business the risk of significant disruption and potential losses from future storm activity exists in all of our primary markets risks related to our industry we may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis which could expose us to additional liability and could have a material adverse effect on us we are required to comply with antimoney laundering antiterrorism and other laws and regulations in the united states these laws and regulations require us among other things to adopt and enforce knowyourcustomer policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities these laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision while we have adopted policies and procedures aimed at detecting and preventing the use of our banking network for money laundering and related activities those policies and procedures may not completely eliminate instances in which we may be used by customers to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities to the extent we fail to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations the occ along with other banking agencies have the authority to impose fines and other penalties and sanctions on us in addition our business and reputation could suffer if customers use our banking network for money laundering or illegal or improper purposes changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings valleys earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and investment securities and interest expense paid on table start form 10k table end interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond valleys control including general economic conditions competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the policies of the frb changes in interest rates driven by such factors could influence not only the interest valley receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect i valleys ability to originate loans and obtain deposits ii the fair value of valleys financial assets including the held to maturity and available for sale investment securities portfolios and iii the average duration of valleys interestearning assets and liabilities this also includes the risk that interestearning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interestbearing liabilities or vice versa repricing risk the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period basis risk and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interestearning asset and interestbearing liability maturities yield curve risk the frb has maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between and percent during although the frb is expected to increase the target federal funds rate and effectively increase interest rates in we can give no assurances that market interest rates will increase decrease or remain unchanged any substantial or unexpected change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on valleys financial condition and results of operations see additional information in the net interest income and interest rate sensitivity sections of our mda the replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate may have an impact on valleys business financial condition or results of operations certain loans made by us and financing extended to us are made at variable rates that use libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate in addition we also have investments interest rate derivatives and borrowings that reference libor on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after subsequently on november the ice benchmark administration announced its plan to extend the date most us dollar libor values would cease being computed to june on the same date the frb fdic and occ issued a joint statement instructing banks to cease entering into new liborbased loan agreements by no later than december in the united states efforts to identify a set of alternative us dollar reference interest rates are ongoing and the alternative reference rate committee arrc has recommended the use of a sofr on april the state of new york enacted legislation which provides that any contract governed by new york law and which references libor and which does not contain effective fallback provisions will be deemed to be replaced by therecommended benchmark replacement under the statute the recommended benchmark replacement should be based on the sofr similar legislation which would cover all us contracts was passed by the us house of representatives in december sofr is different from libor in that it is a backwardlooking secured rate rather than a forwardlooking unsecured rate these differences could lead to a greater disconnect between the banks costs to raise funds for sofr as compared to libor the implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may cause us to incur significant expenses in effecting the transition may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to libor of the substitute index or indices any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations these reforms may cause new methods of calculating libor to be established or the establishment of multiple alternative reference rates these consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us higher chargeoffs and weak credit conditions could require us to further increase our allowance for credit losses through a provision charge to earnings the process for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is critical to our financial results and conditions it requires difficult subjective and complex judgments about the future including the impact of national and regional economic conditions on the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans if our judgment proves to be incorrect our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover the lifetime credit losses inherent in our loan and held to maturity debt securities portfolios as well as unfunded credit commitments deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses additionally bank regulators review the classification of our loans in their examination of us and we may be required in the future to change the internal classification on certain loans which may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan chargeoffs if actual net chargeoffs were to exceed valleys allowance its earnings would be negatively impacted by additional provisions for credit losses any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan chargeoffs as required by the occ or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition table start form 10k table end an increase in our nonperforming assets may reduce our interest income and increase our net loan chargeoffs provision for loan losses and operating expenses nonperforming assets including nonaccrual loans other real estate owned and other repossessed assets totaled million at december our nonaccrual loans increased from percent of total loans at december to percent of total loans at december partially due to a significant increase in nonaccrual taxi medallion loans within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio due to continued negative trends in estimated fair valuations of the underlying taxi medallion collateral a weak operating environment for ride services and uncertain borrower performance the remainder of our previously accruing taxi medallion loans were placed on nonaccrual status during the first quarter at december the nonaccrual taxi medallion loans totaling million had related reserves of million or percent of such loans within the allowance for loan losses these nonperforming assets can adversely affect our net income mainly through decreased interest income and increased operating expenses incurred to maintain such assets or loss charges related to subsequent declines in the estimated fair value of foreclosed assets adverse changes in the value of our nonperforming assets or the underlying collateral or in the borrowers performance or financial conditions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition potential further declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions and the stressed operating environment within both new york city and chicago due to the covid19 pandemic could also negatively impact the future performance of this portfolio there can be no assurance that we will not experience increases in nonperforming loans in the future or that our nonperforming assets will not result in lower financial returns in the future general commercial operational and financial and regulatory risks our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented which may result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition management periodically reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we rely on our systems of controls and procedures and if our system fails our operations could be disrupted we face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures including those to mitigate the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders may prove to be inadequate or are circumvented thereby causing delays in detection of errors or inaccuracies in data and information we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we may also be subject to disruptions of our systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control including for example electrical or telecommunications outages which may give rise to losses in service to customers and to financial loss or liability we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as us and to the risk that our or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate we maintain a system of comprehensive policies and a control framework designed to monitor vendor risks including among other things i changes in the vendors organizational structure or internal controls ii changes in the vendors financial condition iii changes in the vendors support for existing products and services and iv changes in the vendors strategic focus while we believe these policies and procedures help to mitigate risk the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations our financial results and condition may be adversely impacted by changing economic conditions financial institutions can be affected by changing conditions in the real estate and financial markets weak economic conditions could result in financial stress on our borrowers that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations volatility in the housing markets real estate values and unemployment levels could result in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions the majority of valleys lending is in northern and central new jersey the new table start form 10k table end york city metropolitan area florida and alabama as a result of this geographic concentration a significant broadbased deterioration in economic conditions in these areas could have a material adverse impact on the quality of valleys loan portfolio results of operations and future growth potential adverse economic conditions in our market areas can reduce our rate of growth affect our customers ability to repay loans and adversely impact our financial condition and earnings general economic conditions including inflation unemployment and money supply fluctuations also may adversely affect our profitability our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the outbreak of pandemic disease acts of terrorism and other external events the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics such as covid19 could lead to additional quarantines business shutdowns labor shortages disruptions to supply chains and overall economic instability additionally new york city and new jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism against the united states such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses although we have established and regularly test disaster recovery policies and procedures the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our ability to make opportunistic acquisitions is subject to significant risks including the risk that regulators will not provide the requisite approvals we may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks branches financial institutions or related businesses from time to time that we expect may further our business strategy any possible acquisition will be subject to regulatory approval and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approval in a timely manner or at all even if we obtain regulatory approval these acquisitions including our recent acquisition of the westchester bank and pending acquisition of bank leumi usa could involve numerous risks including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs difficulties related to integration diversion of managements attention from other business activities changes in relationships with customers and the potential loss of key employees in addition we may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates integrating acquired institutions or preventing deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at acquired institutions competition for acquisitions can be intense and we may not be able to acquire other institutions on attractive terms there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing or will even pursue future acquisitions or if such transactions are completed that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses into operations ability to grow may be limited if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future the future impact of changes to the internal revenue code is uncertain and may adversely affect our business the us congress passed significant reform of the internal revenue code known as the tax cuts and jobs act of tax act at the end of while the decline in the federal corporate tax rate from percent to percent lowered valleys income tax expense as a percentage of its taxable income in and subsequent years other provisions of the tax act negatively impacted valleys consolidated financial statements and it may adversely affect valley in the future for example under the provisions of the tax act the million million and million of the banks total fdic insurance assessment for the years ended december and respectively was nontax deductible based upon the asset size of the bank if valleys total assets were to exceed billion at any yearend which is likely at the end of due to the pending acquisition of bank leumi usa its entire fdic insurance assessment would be nontax deductible in that fiscal year the future impact of the tax act or subsequent amendments to the tax rates and laws on our business may be adverse our adoption of the cecl model for determining our allowance for credit losses has added volatility and could add additional volatility to our provision for credit losses and earnings effective january valley adopted the fasbs new accounting guidance on the impairment of financial instruments commonly known as the current expected credit loss cecl model the cecl model requires the allowance for credit losses for certain financial assets including loans held to maturity securities and certain offbalance sheet credit exposures to be calculated based on current expected credit losses over the lives of the assets rather than incurred losses as of a point in time our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses accordingly our actual allowance for credit losses may be materially different than the amounts reported due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process including future loss table start form 10k table end estimates based upon our reasonable and supportable economic forecasts also the future amount could differ materially from those estimates due to changes in values and circumstances after the balance sheet date we may be unable to adequately manage our liquidity risk which could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due capitalize on growth opportunities or pay regular dividends on our common stock liquidity risk is the potential that valley will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise or pay regular dividends on our common stock because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances liquidity is required to fund various obligations including credit commitments to borrowers mortgage and other loan originations withdrawals by depositors repayment of borrowings dividends to shareholders operating expenses and capital expenditures liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention principal and interest payments on loans principal and interest payments on investment securities sale maturity and prepayment of investment securities net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources such as the fhlb and certain brokered deposit channels established by the bank our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general factors that could have a detrimental impact to our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to persistent weakness or downturn in the economy or adverse regulatory action against us our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not necessarily specific to us such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole cyber attacks could compromise our information or result in the data of our customers being improperly divulged or our systems being disrupted which could expose us to liability losses and escalating operating costs valley regularly collects processes transmits and stores confidential information regarding its customers employees and others for whom it services loans in some cases this confidential or proprietary information is collected compiled processed transmitted or stored by third parties on valleys behalf information security risks have increased because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks many financial institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data denialofservice or sabotage systems often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyber attacks and other means in addition recently there have been wellpublicized ransomware attacks against various us companies with the intent to materially disrupt their computer network and services valley frequently experiences attempted cybersecurity attacks against its systems in there was a breach by a threat actor of a legacy network from an acquired bank the breach resulted in the unauthorized access of certain data stored on the legacy network the legacy network was isolated from valleys network which was not affected by the incident there can be no assurances that valley will not incur breaches of our systems or that of our vendors which may expose the data of our customers or disrupt our services exposing us to significant damage ongoing operational costs andor reputational harm cyber risk exposure will remain elevated or increase in the future due to among other things the increasing size and prominence of valley in the financial services industry our expansion of internet and mobile banking tools and new products based on customer needs and the system and customer account conversions associated with the integration of merger targets successful attacks on any one of many our thirdparty service providers may adversely affect our business and result in the disclosure or misuse of our confidential information or that of our customers there can be no assurance that we or our thirdparty service providers will not suffer a cyber attack that exposes us to significant damages operational costs or reputational harm extensive regulation and supervision have a negative impact on our ability to compete in a costeffective manner and may subject us to material compliance costs and penalties valley primarily through its principal subsidiary and certain nonbank subsidiaries is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole many laws and regulations affect valleys lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy and growth among other things they encourage valley to ensure a satisfactory level of lending in defined areas and establish and maintain comprehensive programs relating to antimoney laundering and customer identification congress state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies for possible changes changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies could affect valley in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject valley to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products it may offer andor table start form 10k table end increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products among other things failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on valleys business financial condition and results of operations valleys compliance with certain of these laws will be considered by banking regulators when reviewing bank merger and bank holding company acquisitions in addition we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny from the current presidential and congressional administrations as compared to prior administrations changes in key personnel at our federal regulators may result in differing interpretations of existing rules and guidelines and potentially more stringent enforcement and more severe penalties than was previously the case we are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers including the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions the community reinvestment act the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose community investment and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions the consumer financial protection bureau the department of justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations a successful regulatory challenge to an institutions performance under the community reinvestment act the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act or other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions including damages and civil money penalties injunctive relief restrictions on mergers and acquisitions restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines private parties also may challenge an institutions performance under fair lending laws in litigation such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations changes in accounting policies or accounting standards could cause us to change the manner in which we report our financial results and condition in adverse ways and could subject us to additional costs and expenses valleys accounting policies are fundamental to understanding its financial results and condition some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of valleys assets or liabilities and financial results valley identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain under each of these policies it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions using different assumptions or as new information becomes available from time to time the fasb and the sec change their guidance governing the form and content of valleys external financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied such changes are expected to continue and may accelerate dependent upon the fasb and international accounting standards board commitments to achieving convergence between us gaap and international financial reporting standards changes in us gaap and changes in current interpretations are beyond valleys control can be hard to predict and could materially impact how valley reports its financial results and condition in certain cases valley could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently also retroactively which may result in valley restating prior period financial statements for material amounts additionally significant changes to us gaap may require costly technology changes additional training and personnel and other expenses that will negatively impact our results of operations claims and litigation could result in significant expenses losses and damage to our reputation from time to time as part of valleys normal course of business customers bankruptcy trustees former customers contractual counterparties third parties and current and former employees make claims and take legal action against valley based on actions or inactions of valley if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to valley they may result in financial liability andor adversely affect the market perception of valley and its products and services this may also impact customer demand for valleys products and services any financial liability could have a material adverse effect on valleys financial condition and results of operations any reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on valleys business table start form 10k table end risks related to an investment in our securities we may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend on our common stock which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future depending upon our results of operations financial condition or other metrics this reduction or elimination of our dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make distributions to us we may be unable to make dividend payments to our preferred and common shareholders or interest payments on our longterm borrowings and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries and depend on dividends distributions and other payments from the bank and its nonbanking subsidiaries to fund cash dividend payments on our preferred and common stock and to fund most payments on our other obligations regulations relating to capital requirements affect the ability of the bank to pay dividends and other distributions to us and to make loans to us additionally if our subsidiaries earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels we may not be able to make dividend payments to our preferred and common shareholders or interest payments on our longterm borrowings and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts furthermore our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors valleys shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in and will exercise less influence over management of valley after the acquisition of bank leumi usa valleys shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the valley board and on other matters affecting valley upon completion of the merger valley anticipates that shares of valley common stock held by former bank leumi usa shareholders will represent approximately percent of the outstanding

have less influence on the management and policies of valley after completion of the merger than they now have on the management and policies of valley the bank leumi usa acquisition and future acquisitions may dilute shareholder value especially tangible book value per share we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other financial institutions if the bank leumi usa acquisition is completed we will issue approximately million shares of valley common stock while there are many variables we anticipate that tangible book value will be diluted by percent with an earn back period expected to be approximately one year or longer depending on the speed of achieving cost savings and the amount of savings future mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our tangible book value per common share may occur in connection with any future acquisitions future offerings of common stock preferred stock debt or other securities may adversely affect the market price of our stock and dilute the holdings of existing
