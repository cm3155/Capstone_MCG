item risk factors table end an investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business the material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect valley are described below before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing valley additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently believes are immaterial may also impair valleys business operations the value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks and you could lose all or part of your investment this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors risks related to the operating environment our financial results and condition may be adversely impacted by changing economic conditions financial institutions are affected by changes in the economic environment which may be impacted by changing interest rates volatility in financial markets and geopolitical instability or conflict economic conditions financial markets and monetary policies may be adversely affected by the impact of inflationary pressures affected by the impact of current or anticipated fiscal and monetary policies the potential for an economic recession uncertainty regarding the us debt ceiling government shutdowns or default by the us government on its obligations and actual or perceived instability in the us table start form 10k table end banking system changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters including the conflicts between russia and ukraine and israel and hamas foreign currency exchange volatility volatility in global capital markets inflationary pressures and higher interest rates may meaningfully impact loan production net interest margin the value of our securities portfolio and the measurement of certain significant estimates such as the allowance for credit losses moreover in a period of economic contraction we may experience elevated levels of credit losses reduced interest income impairment of goodwill and other financial assets diminished access to capital markets and other funding sources and reduced demand for our products and services volatility in the housing markets real estate values and unemployment levels results in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions the majority of valleys lending is in northern and central new jersey the new york city metropolitan area and florida as a result of this geographic concentration a significant broadbased deterioration in economic conditions in these areas could have a material adverse impact on the quality of valleys loan portfolio results of operations and future growth potential during and the federal reserve took unprecedented action to restrain inflation and improve the stability of the economy by raising the upper target federal funds rate from percent to percent as inflation increases and market interest rates rise the value of our investment securities particularly those with longer maturities would decrease although this effect can be less pronounced for floating rate instruments in addition inflation generally increases the cost of goods and services we use in our business operations such as electricity and other utilities which increases our noninterest expenses furthermore our customers are also affected by inflation and the rising costs of goods and services used in their households and businesses which could have a negative impact on their deposits andor ability to repay their loans with us any of these effects if sustained may impair our capital and liquidity positions require us to take capital actions prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements or result in downgrades in our credit ratings and the reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend in future periods the extent to which the economic environment has an impact on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as the regulatory capital and liquidity ratios will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the current economic environment and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to geopolitical conflicts inflationary pressure and other changes in economic and political conditions our financial results and condition may be adversely impacted by banking failures or any future similar events certain events impacting the banking industry including the bank failures in march and april resulted in significant disruption and volatility in the capital markets reduced valuations of bank securities and decreased confidence in banks among certain depositors other counterparties and investors during most of these events occurred in the context of rapidly rising interest rates which among other things resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration debt securities and loans held by banks and increased competition for deposits these events had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock while the us department of the treasury the federal reserve and the fdic took steps to ensure that depositors of the failed banks in early would have access to their insured and uninsured deposits and to facilitate sales of certain failed banks there is no assurance that these or similar actions will restore customer confidence in the banking system and we may be further impacted by concerns regarding the soundness real or perceived of other financial institutions or other future bank failures or disruptions the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood that negative public opinion from any of the real or perceived events discussed above could impact our reputation and business any loss of client deposits or changes in our credit ratings could increase the cost of funding limit access to capital markets or negatively impact our overall liquidity or capitalization the cost of resolving the recent bank failures has also prompted the fdic to issue a special assessment to recover costs to the dif the special assessment for the bank resulted in a million pretax charge to earnings in the fourth quarter among other things the fdic maintains the ability to impose an additional shortfall special assessment based on the difference between actual losses from the bank failures and the amounts collected for additional information on the fdics special assessment see item businesssupervision and regulation and item mdasubsequent events the extent to which the shortfall special assessment will impact our future deposit insurance expense is currently uncertain these recent events and any future similar events may also result in changes to laws or regulations governing bank holding companies and banks including higher capital requirements or the imposition of restrictions through supervisory or enforcement activities which could materially impact our business table start form 10k table end risks associated with our business model valley has incurred and could continue to incur significant costs related to its systems integration and technology roadmap in october valley executed and completed its core conversion in connection with the acquisition of bank leumi usa valley has incurred and could continue to incur substantial costs in connection with the integration of valley and bank leumi usa and implementation of its technology roadmap for the organization while the core conversion is substantially complete we continue to optimize a large number of processes procedures operations and technologies related to our new single core banking system valley has assumed that a certain level of costs will be incurred for these continued enhancements and the consolidation of back office functions however there are many factors beyond valleys control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the remaining costs and the anticipated benefits and synergies if any resulting upon completion several costs that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately as a result the remaining integration and technology enhancements may result in valley taking larger than expected charges against its earnings a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by commercial real estate and events that negatively impact the real estate market could adversely affect our asset quality and profitability for those loans secured by real property and increase the number of defaults and the level of losses within our loan portfolio as of december total commercial real estate loans including construction loans represented percent of our loan portfolio these types of loans generally expose a lender to a higher degree of credit risk of nonpayment and loss than residential mortgage loans do because of several factors including dependence on the successful operation of a business or a project for repayment and loan terms with a balloon payment rather than full amortization over the loan term in addition commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to onetofour family residential mortgage loans the value of the real estate collateral that provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower could deteriorate during the time the credit is extended underwriting and portfolio management activities cannot completely eliminate all risks related to these loans any significant failure to pay on time by our clients or a significant default by our clients would materially and adversely affect us concentrations in commercial real estate are closely monitored by regulatory agencies and subject to especially heightened scrutiny both on a public and confidential basis any formal or informal action by our supervisors may require us to increase our reserves on these loans and adversely impact our earnings a downturn in the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values our earnings and shareholders equity could be adversely affected any weakening of the commercial real estate market may increase the likelihood of default on these loans which could negatively impact our loan portfolios performance and asset quality for example any declines in commercial real estate prices in the new jersey new york and florida markets we primarily serve along with the unpredictable longterm path of the economy may result in increases in delinquencies and losses in our loan portfolios unexpected decreases in commercial real estate prices coupled with slow economic growth and elevated levels of unemployment could drive losses beyond those which are provided for in our allowance for loan losses we also may incur losses on commercial real estate loans due to declines in occupancy rates and rental rates which may decrease property values and may decrease the likelihood that a borrower may find permanent financing alternatives any of these events could increase our costs require managements time and attention and materially and adversely affect us the loss of or decrease in lowercost funding sources within our deposit base including our inability to achieve deposit retention targets within our branch network may adversely impact our net interest income and net income checking and savings now and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments such as the stock market us treasury securities and money market or fixed income mutual funds as providing a better riskreturn tradeoff additionally our customers largely bank with us because of our local customer service and convenience for certain customers this convenience could be negatively impacted by strategic consolidation or relocation of our branch offices additionally the adoption of online banking technology could reduce the historical stickiness of our core deposits due to the relative ease with which depositors may transfer deposits to a different depository institution including in the event that confidence is lost in the bank valleys vulnerability to a bank run may be heightened by recent trends in depositor behavior highly coordinated depositors via social media or other communications can cause unexpectedly high deposit outflows resulting in a liquidity crisis as happened in the case of the bank failures in early if customers move money out of bank table start form 10k table end deposits and into other investments valley could lose a lowcost source of funds increasing its funding costs and reducing valleys net interest income and net income our deposit services for businesses in the state licensed cannabis industry could expose us to liabilities and regulatory compliance costs in we implemented specialized deposit services intended for state licensed cannabis business customers businesses engaged in the cultivation manufacture distribution and sale of cannabis are legal in numerous states and the district of columbia including our primary markets of new jersey new york and florida however such businesses are not legal at the federal level and marijuana remains a schedule i drug under the controlled substances act of in fincen published guidelines for financial institutions servicing state legal cannabis businesses we have implemented a comprehensive control framework that includes written policies and procedures related to the onboarding of such businesses and the ongoing monitoring and maintenance of such business accounts that comports with the fincen guidance additionally our policies call for due diligence review of the cannabis business before the business is onboarded including confirmation that the business is properly licensed and maintains the license in good standing in the applicable state throughout the relationship our policies call for continued monitoring of the business including site visits where appropriate to determine if the business continues to meet our requirements including maintenance of required licenses and calls for undertaking periodic financial reviews of the business in the latter half of the bank expanded its cannabisrelated business offerings to some limited lending on real estate the bank may offer additional banking products and services to such customers in the future there can be no assurance that compliance with our policies and procedures designed to allow us to operate in compliance with the fincen guidelines will protect us from federal prosecution or other regulatory sanctions federal prosecutors have significant discretion and there can be no assurance that the federal prosecutors will not choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis any change in the federal governments enforcement position could potentially subject us to criminal prosecution and other regulatory sanctions as a general matter the medical and recreational cannabis business is considered highrisk thus increasing the risk of a regulatory action against our bsaaml program that has adverse consequences including but not limited to preventing us from undertaking mergers acquisitions and other expansion activities we could incur future goodwill impairment if our estimates of the fair value of our goodwill change as a result of changes in our business or other factors we may determine a goodwill impairment charge is necessary estimates of the fair value of goodwill are determined using several factors and assumptions including but not limited to industry pricing multiples and estimated cash flows based upon valleys goodwill impairment testing the fair values of its three reporting units wealth management consumer banking and commercial banking were in excess of their carrying values no assurance can be given that we will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in the future and any such impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition at december our goodwill totaled billion see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information our market share and income may be adversely affected by our inability to successfully compete against larger and more diverse financial service providers digital fintech startup firms and other financial services providers that have advanced technological capabilities valley faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than valley to deal with the potential negative changes in the financial markets and regulatory landscape many of these competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints broader geographic service areas greater capital and in some cases lower cost structures valley competes with other providers of financial services such as commercial and savings banks savings and loan associations credit unions money market and mutual funds mortgage companies title agencies asset managers insurance companies and a large list of other local regional and national institutions which offer financial services additionally the financial services industry is facing a wave of digital disruption from fintech companies and other large financial services providers the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services which increase efficiency and enable financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs these competitors provide innovative webbased solutions to traditional retail banking services and products fintech companies tend to have stronger operating efficiencies and fewer regulatory burdens than their traditional bank counterparts including valley regulatory changes may continue to allow new entrants into the markets in which we operate the result of these regulatory changes will likely cause other nontraditional financial services companies to compete directly with valley many table start form 10k table end of the companies have stronger operating efficiencies and fewer regulatory burdens than their traditional bank counterparts including valley our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as a result of the pandemic many customers have become more reliant on and their expectations have increased with respect to this technology we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers and service interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws many of valleys competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements valley may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on valleys business and in turn valleys financial condition and results of operations failure to successfully implement our growth strategies could cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses which may not be recouped and adversely affect our future profitability from time to time valley may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed valley may invest significant time and resources to develop and market new lines of business andor products and services initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting customer preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service additionally any new line of business andor new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of valleys system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on valleys business results of operations and financial condition our investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations we invest in certain taxadvantaged investments that support qualified affordable housing projects community development and renewable energy resources our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits over specified time periods third parties perform diligence on these investments for us on which we rely both at inception and on an ongoing basis we are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level may fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and may not be able to be realized the possible inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits may have a negative impact on our financial results the risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside our control including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed we have million in reserve for tax liability positions at december related to certain tax credits and other tax benefits previously recognized by valley where subsequently a thirdparty fraud was uncovered by the us department of justice in while we believe that valley was fully reserved for the tax positions related to this matter at december we continue to evaluate all our existing tax positions each quarter under gaap we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property during the ordinary course of business we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans in doing so there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if hazardous or toxic substances are found we may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property in addition future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review prior to originating certain commercial real estate loans as well as before initiating any foreclosure action on real property these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations table start form 10k table end we may incur future losses in connection with repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market we engage in the origination of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market while typically retaining the loan servicing in connection with such sales we make representations and warranties which if breached may require us to repurchase such loans substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans the aggregate principal balances of residential mortgage loans serviced by the bank for others approximated billion and billion at december and respectively over the past several years we have experienced a nominal amount of repurchase requests that have actually resulted in repurchases by valley during and valley repurchased and loans with outstanding principal balances of million and million at the repurchase dates respectively none of the loan repurchases resulted in a material loss as of december no reserves pertaining to loans sold were established on our financial statements it is possible that our careful loan underwriting and documentation standards may not be sufficient to prevent additional requests to repurchase loans that could occur in the future and such requests may have a negative financial impact on us interest rate swap fees within capital markets income are a significant component of our noninterest income and could fluctuate in future periods valley executes interest rate swaps with commercial lending customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies interest rate swap fees reported within capital markets income totaled approximately million or percent and million or percent of total noninterest income for the years ended december and respectively several factors including but not limited to the actual and expected level of market interest rates can impact the decisions of commercial loan customers to use such interest rate swap products as a result we can provide no assurance that our interest rate swap fees will remain at the level reported for the year ended december we may not be able to attract develop and retain skilled people our success depends in large part on our ability to attract develop and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them in particular due to an increasingly competitive labor market we have been impacted by an extremely competitive labor market including increased competition for talent across all aspects of our business as well as increased competition with nontraditional competitors such as fintech companies employers are offering increased compensation and opportunities to work with greater flexibility including remote work on a permanent basis these can be important factors in a current associates decision to leave us as well as in a prospective associates decision to join us as competition for skilled professionals remains intense we may have to devote significant resources to attract and retain qualified personnel which could negatively impact earnings the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel including but not limited to the executive officers disclosed in item business of this report could have a material adverse impact on our business because we would lose the employees skills knowledge of the market and years of industry experience and may have difficulty promptly finding qualified replacement personnel we are subject to risks relating to esg matters that could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations as well as the price of our common and preferred stock we are subject to a variety of risks including reputational risk associated with esg matters the public holds diverse and often conflicting views on these matters we have multiple stakeholders including our shareholders clients associates federal and state regulatory authorities and the communities in which we operate and these stakeholders will often have differing priorities and expectations regarding esg issues if we take action in conflict with one or another of those stakeholders expectations we could experience an increase in client complaints a loss of business or reputational harm we could also face negative publicity or reputational harm based on the identity of those with whom we choose to do business any adverse publicity in connection with esg issues could damage our reputation ability to attract and retain clients and associates compete effectively and grow our business in addition proxy advisory firms and certain institutional investors who manage investments in public companies are increasingly integrating esg factors into their investment analysis the consideration of esg factors in making investment and voting decisions is relatively new accordingly the frameworks and methods for assessing esg policies are not fully developed vary considerably among the investment community and will likely continue to evolve over time moreover the subjective nature of methods used by various stakeholders to assess a company with respect to esg criteria could result in erroneous perceptions or a misrepresentation of our actual esg policies and practices organizations that provide ratings information to investors on esg matters may also assign unfavorable ratings to us certain of our clients might also require that we implement additional esg procedures or standards in order to continue to do business with them if we fail to comply with specific esgrelated investor or client expectations and standards or to provide the disclosure relating to esg issues that any table start form 10k table end third parties may believe is necessary or appropriate regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so our reputation business financial condition andor results of operations as well as the price of our common and preferred stock could be negatively impacted climate change and severe weather could adversely impact our operations business and clients there is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters climate change presents i physical risks from the direct impacts of changing climate patterns and acute weather events and ii transition risks from changes in regulations disruptive technologies and shifting market dynamics towards a lower carbon economy the physical risks of climate change include discrete events such as floods hurricanes tornadoes heatwaves and wildfires and longerterm shifts in climate patterns such as higher global average temperatures extreme heat sea level rise and more frequent and prolonged droughts examples of transition risks include changes in consumer preferences additional regulatory requirements or taxes and additional counterparty or client requirements these risks could have a material adverse impact on asset values and the financial performance of valleys businesses and those of its clients ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory compliance credit and reputational risks and costs climate change could also present incremental risks to the execution of valleys longterm strategy additionally transitioning to a lowcarbon economy may entail extensive policy legal technology and market initiatives a significant portion of our primary markets is located near coastal waters which could generate naturally occurring severe weather or do so in response to climate change which in turn could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business many areas in new jersey new york florida and alabama in which the vast majority of our branches and offices operate are subject to severe flooding from time to time and significant disruptions related to the weather may become common events in the future heavy storms and hurricanes can also cause severe property damage and result in business closures negatively impacting both the financial health of retail and commercial customers and our ability to operate our business the risk of significant disruption and potential losses from future storm activity exists in all of our primary markets in addition our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change including our involvement or our clients involvement in certain industries or projects in the absence of mitigation andor transition measures associated with causing or exacerbating climate change as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change as climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types valley continues to embed climate risk considerations into risk management strategies due to uncertainty regarding climate change the companys risk management strategies may not be effective in fully mitigating climate risk exposures the timing and severity of climate change may not be entirely predictable and our risk management processes may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure risks related to our industry changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings valleys earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon the banks net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and investment securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond valleys control including general economic conditions competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the policies of the federal reserve changes in interest rates driven by such factors will influence not only the interest the bank receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect i the banks ability to originate loans and obtain deposits ii the fair value of valleys financial assets including the htm and afs investment securities portfolios and iii the average duration of valleys interestearning assets and liabilities this also includes the risk that interestearning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interestbearing liabilities or vice versa repricing risk the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period basis risk and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interestearning asset and interestbearing liability maturities yield curve risk the federal reserve maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between and percent during beginning in march the federal reserve significantly increased the target federal funds rate incrementally through and resulting in a target range between and percent at december with the federal reserve deciding to maintain this target range as of january the future direction and levels of interest rates remain uncertain any substantial or unexpected change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on valleys financial condition and results of operations see additional information in the net interest income and interest rate sensitivity sections of our mda table start form 10k table end we may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis which could expose us to additional liability and could have a material adverse effect on us we are required to comply with antimoney laundering antiterrorism and other laws and regulations in the united states these laws and regulations require us among other things to adopt and enforce knowyourcustomer policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities these laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision the policies and procedures that we have adopted to comply with these requirements and to detect and prevent the use of our banking network for money laundering and related activities may not completely eliminate instances in which we may be used by customers to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities to the extent we fail to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations the occ along with other banking agencies have the authority to impose fines and other penalties and sanctions on us in addition our business and reputation could suffer if customers use our banking network for money laundering or illegal or improper purposes higher chargeoffs and weak credit conditions could require us to further increase our allowance for credit losses through a provision charge to earnings the process for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is critical to our financial results and conditions it requires difficult subjective and complex judgments about the future including the impact of national and regional economic conditions on the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans if our judgment proves to be incorrect our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover the lifetime credit losses inherent in our loan and htm debt securities portfolios as well as unfunded credit commitments deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers including as a result of inflationary pressures or other macroeconomic factors resulting from the covid19 pandemic or otherwise new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses additionally bank regulators review the classification of our loans in their examination of us and we may be required in the future to change the internal classification on certain loans which may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan chargeoffs if actual net chargeoffs were to exceed valleys allowance its earnings would be negatively impacted by additional provisions for credit losses any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan chargeoffs as required by the occ or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition an increase in our nonperforming assets may reduce our interest income and increase our net loan chargeoffs provision for loan losses and operating expenses nonperforming assets including nonaccrual loans oreo and other repossessed assets totaled million at december our nonaccrual loans represented percent of total loans at december which included nonaccrual taxi medallion loans totali ng million that had related reserves of million or percent of such loans within the allowance for loan losses these nonperforming assets can adversely affect our net income mainly through decreased interest income and increased operating expenses incurred to maintain such assets or loss charges related to subsequent declines in the estimated fair value of foreclosed assets adverse changes in the value of our nonperforming assets or the underlying collateral or in the borrowers performance or financial conditions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition potential further stress in the commercial real estate markets primarily in new york city declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions or other factors could also negatively impact the future performance of this portfolio there can be no assurance that we will not experience increases in nonperforming loans in the future or that our nonperforming assets will not result in lower financial returns in the future we may be required to consult with the federal reserve before declaring cash dividends on our common stock which ultimately may delay reduce or eliminate such dividends and adversely affect the market price of our common stock holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as the board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so we may reduce or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future depending upon our results of operations financial condition or other metrics which could be adversely impacted by the factors described in this item including uncertain us economic conditions in july the federal reserve updated its supervisory guidance to provide greater clarity regarding the situations in which bank holding companies like valley may expect an expedited consultation in connection with the declaration of dividends that exceed quarterly earnings to qualify amongst other criteria total commercial real estate loan concentrations cannot represent percent or more of total capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio table start form 10k table end cannot increase by percent or more during the prior months currently we believe that valley does not meet the standard for expedited consultation and approval of its dividend should it be required as a result valley could be subject to a lengthier and possibly more burdensome review process by the federal reserve when considering paying dividends that exceed quarterly earnings the delay reduction or elimination of our quarterly dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock see additional information regarding our quarterly cash dividend and the current rate of earnings retention in the capital adequacy section of the mda general commercial operational financial and regulatory risks we may be unable to adequately manage our liquidity risk which could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due capitalize on growth opportunities pay regular dividends on our common stock and generate adequate earnings liquidity risk is the potential that valley will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise or pay regular dividends on our common stock because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances liquidity is required to fund various obligations including withdrawals by depositors repayment of borrowings credit commitments to borrowers mortgage and other loan originations dividends to shareholders operating expenses and capital expenditures liquidity is derived primarily from commercial and retail deposit growth and retention principal and interest payments on loans principal and interest payments on investment securities sale maturity and prepayment of investment securities net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources such as the fhlb and certain brokered deposit channels established by the bank our access to funding sources including the fhlb and brokered deposits in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general unexpected changes to the fhlbs underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies may limit or restrict our ability to borrow and therefore could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity other factors that could have a detrimental impact to our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to persistent weakness or downturn in the economy or adverse regulatory action against us our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not necessarily specific to us such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole in the event of future turmoil in the banking industry or other idiosyncratic events there is no guarantee that the us government will invoke the systemic risk exception create additional liquidity programs or take any other action to stabilize the banking industry or provide liquidity additionally our inability to access brokered deposits or other funding sources such as the fhlb could require us to pay significantly higher interest rates on our direct customer deposits which would have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net income valleys inability to monetize liquid assets or to access shortterm funding or capital markets could constrain valleys ability to make new loans or meet existing lending commitments pay its regular common stock dividend jeopardize valleys capitalization and adversely impact valleys net interest income and net income the cecl model for determining our allowance for credit losses could add volatility to our provision for credit losses and earnings the cecl model requires the allowance for credit losses for certain financial assets including loans htm securities and certain offbalance sheet credit exposures to be calculated based on current expected credit losses over the lives of the assets rather than incurred losses as of a point in time our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance accordingly our actual lifetime credit losses may be materially different than the amounts reported in the allowance due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process including future loss estimates based upon our reasonable and supportable economic forecasts also future credit losses could differ materially from those estimates due to changes in values and circumstances after the balance sheet date changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance provision for credit losses and earnings our controls and procedures may fail or be

to customers and to financial loss or liability we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as us and to the risk that our or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate we maintain a system of comprehensive policies and a control framework designed to monitor vendor risks including among other things i changes in the vendors organizational structure or internal controls ii changes in the vendors financial condition iii changes in the vendors support for existing products and services and iv changes in the vendors strategic focus while we believe these policies and procedures help to mitigate risk the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters pandemics acts of terrorism and other catastrophic events the occurrence of natural disasters extreme weather events health crises the occurrence or worsening of disease outbreaks or pandemics or other catastrophic events as well as government actions or other restrictions in connection with such events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics such as covid19 could lead to quarantines business shutdowns labor shortages disruptions to supply chains and overall economic instability additionally new york city and new jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism against the united states such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our ability to make opportunistic acquisitions is subject to significant risks including the risk that regulators will not provide the requisite approvals we may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks branches financial institutions or related businesses from time to time that we expect may further our business strategy any possible acquisition will be subject to regulatory approval and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approval in a timely manner or at all even if we obtain regulatory approval these acquisitions could involve numerous risks including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs difficulties related to integration diversion of managements attention from other business activities changes in relationships with customers and the potential loss of key employees in addition we may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates integrating acquired institutions or preventing deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at acquired institutions competition for acquisitions can be intense and we may not be able to acquire other institutions on attractive terms there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing or will even pursue future acquisitions or if such transactions are completed that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses into operations ability to grow may be limited if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions to our information

otherwise processed by third parties on valleys behalf cybersecurity risks have increased because of the proliferation of new technologies including artificial intelligence and the increased sophistication and activities of threat actors including organized criminal groups hacktivists terrorists nation states nationstate supported actors and other external parties many financial institutions and table start form 10k table end companies engaged in data processing have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems or networks some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to personal confidential proprietary or sensitive information destroy data denialofservice or sabotage systems

in addition there have been wellpublicized ransomware attacks against various us companies with the intent to materially disrupt their computer network and services globally cybersecurity attacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and wellfinanced or at times supported by state actors in addition geopolitical tensions or conflicts such as russias invasion of ukraine increasing tension with china or the unfolding events in israel and the gaza strip may create a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks cybersecurity risks also may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties or may result from human error software bugs server malfunctions software or hardware failure or other technological failure such threats may be difficult to detect for long periods of time and also may be further enhanced in frequency or effectiveness through threat actors use of artificial intelligence valley frequently experiences attempted cybersecurity attacks against its systems and certain attacks have been successful valley has also been impacted by cybersecurity breaches of its vendors systems there can be no assurances that valley will not incur future breaches of our systems or be impacted by breaches of our vendors systems which in either case may expose the data of our customers or disrupt our services exposing us to significant damage ongoing operational costs andor reputational harm we do not control our vendors and our ability to monitor their cybersecurity is limited and our cybersecurity diligence on key vendors may not be sufficient to prevent a failure or cybersecurity incident that may impact us or our customers some of our vendors may store or have access to our data and we rely on these vendors to implement information security programs commensurate with the relevant risk we cannot however ensure in all circumstances that their efforts will be successful a vulnerability in our vendors software or systems a failure of our vendors safeguards policies or procedures or a cyberattack or other cybersecurity incident affecting any of these third parties could harm our business during we were notified of breaches related to the moveit file transfer software used by certain of our thirdparty service providers as a result of which unauthorized parties were able to obtain access to certain bank customer data that included personally identifiable information appropriate notifications were provided to potentially impacted customers while our business has not been materially impacted by these cybersecurity incidents similar incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business in the future cybersecurity risk exposure will remain elevated or increase in the future due to among other things the increasing size and prominence of valley in the financial services industry our expansion of internet and mobile banking tools and new products based on customer needs and the system and customer account conversions associated with the integration of merger targets successful attacks on us or any one of our many thirdparty service providers may adversely affect our business and result in the loss of unauthorized access to or disclosure of or the misuse or misappropriation of our personal confidential proprietary or sensitive information or that of our

regulatory scrutinyin the course of routine examinations and otherwiseand new regulations designed to respond to recent negative developments in the banking industry all of which may increase our costs of doing business and reduce our profitability among other things there may be increased focus by both regulators and investors on deposit composition the level of uninsured deposits brokered

increased scrutiny or be viewed as higher risk by regulators andor the investor community which could negatively affect its results of operations and financial condition heightened regulatory scrutiny or the results of an investigation or examination may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions regulatory enforcement and fines have increased across the banking and financial services sector there is no assurance that those actions will not result in regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against valley or the bank furthermore a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in addition if one or more financial institutions are found to have violated a law or regulation relating to certain business activities this could lead to investigations by regulators or other governmental agencies of the same or similar activities by other financial institutions including valley and large fines and remedial measures that may have been imposed in resolving earlier investigations for the same or similar activities at other financial institutions may be used as the basis for future settlements table start form 10k table end we are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers including the

restrictions on entering new business lines private parties also may challenge an institutions performance under fair lending laws in litigation such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations changes in accounting policies or accounting standards could cause us to change the manner in which we report our financial results and condition in adverse ways and could subject us to additional costs and expenses valleys accounting policies are fundamental to understanding its financial results and condition some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of valleys assets or liabilities and financial results valley identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain under each of these policies it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions using different assumptions or as new information becomes available from time to time the fasb and the sec change their guidance governing the form and content of valleys external financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret gaap such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied such changes are expected to continue and may accelerate dependent upon the fasb and international accounting standards board commitments to achieving convergence between gaap and international financial reporting standards changes in gaap and changes in current interpretations are beyond valleys control can be hard to predict and could materially impact how valley reports its financial results and condition in certain cases valley could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently also retroactively which may result in valley restating prior period financial statements for material amounts additionally significant changes to gaap may require costly technology changes additional training and personnel and other expenses that will negatively impact our results of operations claims and litigation could result in significant expenses losses and damage to our reputation from time to time as part of valleys normal course of business customers bankruptcy trustees former customers contractual counterparties third parties and current and former employees make claims and take legal action against valley based on actions or inactions of valley if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to valley they may result in financial liability andor adversely affect the market perception of valley and its products and services this may also
