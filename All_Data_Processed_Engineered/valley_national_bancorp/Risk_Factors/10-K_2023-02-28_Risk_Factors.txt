item risk factors table end an investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business the material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect valley are described below before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing valley additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently believes are immaterial may also impair valleys business operations the value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks and you could lose all or part of your investment this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors risks related to the operating environment and the covid19 pandemic our financial results and condition may be adversely impacted by changing economic conditions financial institutions can be affected by changing conditions in the real estate and financial markets the lingering effects of the covid19 pandemic geopolitical instability including the conflict between russia and ukraine foreign currency exchange volatility volatility in global capital markets inflationary pressures and higher interest rates may meaningfully impact loan production income levels and the measurement of certain significant estimates such as the allowance for credit losses moreover in a period of economic contraction we may experience elevated levels of credit losses reduced interest income impairment of goodwill and other financial assets diminished access to capital markets and other funding sources and reduced demand for our products and services volatility in the housing markets real estate values and unemployment levels results in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions the majority of valleys lending is in northern and central new jersey the new york city metropolitan area and florida as a result of this geographic concentration a significant broadbased deterioration in economic conditions in these areas could have a material adverse impact on the quality of valleys loan portfolio results of operations and future growth potential an unexpected covid19 pandemic resurgence due to new variants could cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio additional increases in our allowance for credit losses impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets diminished access to capital markets and other funding sources further reduced demand for our products and services and other negative impacts on our financial position results of operations during the federal reserve took unprecedented action during the year to restrain inflation and improve the stability of the economy by raising the target federal funds rate several times from basis points in the beginning of the year to basis points toward the end of the year and brought the benchmark interest rates up by a collective percent as inflation increases and market interest rates rise the value of our investment securities particularly those with longer maturities would decrease although this effect can be less pronounced for floating rate instruments in addition inflation generally increases the cost of goods and services we use in our business operations such as electricity and other utilities which increases our noninterest expenses furthermore our customers are also affected by inflation and the rising costs of goods and services used in their households and businesses which could have a negative impact on their ability to repay their loans with us any of these effects if sustained may impair our capital and liquidity positions require us to take capital actions prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements or result in downgrades in our credit ratings and the reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend in future periods the extent to which current economic environment has a further impact on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as the regulatory capital and liquidity ratios will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the current economic environment and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the geopolitical conflict and inflationary pressure risks related to our merger with bank leumi usa valley has incurred and is expected to incur significant costs related to the merger and integration valley has incurred certain nonrecurring costs associated with the initial merger including legal financial advisory accounting consulting and other advisory fees severanceemployee benefitrelated costs and other related costs valley has also incurred and is expected to incur substantial costs in connection with the integration of valley and bank leumi usa there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems integrations that are still ongoing valley has assumed that a certain level of costs will be incurred however there are many factors beyond valleys control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration costs moreover many of the costs that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these integration costs may result in valley taking charges against table start form 10k table end earnings and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present valley incurred total mergerrelated expenses of million and million for the years ended december and respectively combining valley and bank leumi usa may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and valley may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from the merger valley must successfully integrate the bank leumi usa business in a manner that permits those synergies to be realized if valley is not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected in addition the actual synergies and anticipated benefits of the merger could be less than anticipated and integration may result in additional unforeseen expenses prior to the merger valley and bank leumi usa operated independently the success of the merger depends in part on valleys ability to successfully complete the ongoing integration of the businesses of both companies in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer relations or result in decreased revenue or reputational harm it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of either companys ongoing businesses difficulties in integrating operations and systems including communications systems administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control systems or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger any disruption to either companys business could cause its customers to remove their accounts and move their business to a competing financial institution integration efforts may also divert management attention and resources these integration matters could have an adverse effect on valley valley may be unable to retain valley or bank leumi usa personnel successfully the success of the merger depends in part on valleys ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees employed prior to the merger by valley and bank leumi usa it is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with valley if valley is unable to retain key employees including management who are critical to the successful integration of the companies and future operations valley could face disruptions in operations loss of existing customers loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment costs in addition if key employees terminate their employment valleys business activities may be adversely affected and managements attention may be diverted from successfully integrating valley and bank leumi usa to hiring suitable replacements all of which may cause valleys business to suffer in addition valley may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave risks associated with our business model the loss of or decrease in lowercost funding sources within our deposit base including our inability to achieve deposit retention targets under our branch transformation strategy may adversely impact our net interest income and net income checking and savings now and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments such as the stock market us treasury securities and money market or fixed income mutual funds as providing a better riskreturn tradeoff additionally our customers largely bank with us because of our local customer service and convenience for certain customers this convenience could be negatively impacted by continued branch consolidation activity undergone as part of our branch transformation strategy if customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments valley could lose a lowcost source of funds increasing its funding costs and reducing valleys net interest income and net income our deposit services for businesses in the state licensed cannabis industry could expose us to liabilities and regulatory compliance costs in we implemented specialized deposit services intended for a limited number of state licensed medicaluse cannabis business customers medical use cannabis as well as recreational use businesses are legal in numerous states and the district of columbia including our primary markets of new jersey new york and florida however such businesses are not legal at the federal level and marijuana remains a schedule i drug under the controlled substances act of in the us department of the treasurys financial crimes enforcement network fincen published guidelines for financial institutions servicing state legal cannabis businesses we have implemented a comprehensive control framework that includes written policies and procedures related to the onboarding of such businesses and the monitoring and maintenance of such business accounts that comports with the fincen guidance additionally our policies call for due diligence review of the cannabis business before the business is onboarded including confirmation that the business is properly licensed and maintains the license in good standing in the applicable state throughout the relationship our policies call for continued monitoring of table start form 10k table end the business including site visits to determine if the business continues to meet our requirements including maintenance of required licenses and calls for undertaking periodic financial reviews of the business the banks program originally was limited to offering depository products to medical cannabis businesses deposit transactions are monitored for compliance with the applicable state medical program rules and other regulations in the latter half of the bank expanded its cannabisrelated business offerings to some limited lending on real estate and deposit services to licensed recreational dispensaries the bank may offer additional banking products and services to such customers in the future while we believe our policies and procedures allow us to operate in compliance with the fincen guidelines there can be no assurance that compliance with the fincen guidelines will protect us from federal prosecution or other regulatory sanctions federal prosecutors have significant discretion and there can be no assurance that the federal prosecutors will not choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis any change in the federal governments enforcement position could potentially subject us to criminal prosecution and other regulatory sanctions as a general matter the medical and recreational cannabis business is considered highrisk thus increasing the risk of a regulatory action against our bsaaml program that has adverse consequences including but not limited to preventing us from undertaking mergers acquisitions and other expansion activities a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate and events that negatively impact the real estate market could adversely affect our asset quality and profitability for those loans secured by real property and increase the number of defaults and the level of losses within our loan portfolio a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate as of december approximately percent of our total loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and could deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended a downturn in the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values our earnings and shareholders equity could be adversely affected any declines in home or commercial real estate prices in the new jersey new york and florida markets we primarily serve along with the unpredictable longterm path of the economy also may result in increases in delinquencies and losses in our loan portfolios unexpected decreases in home or commercial real estate prices coupled with slow economic growth and elevated levels of unemployment could drive losses beyond those which are provided for in our allowance for loan losses in that event our earnings could be adversely affected we could incur future goodwill impairment if our estimates of the fair value of our goodwill change as a result of changes in our business or other factors we may determine a goodwill impairment charge is necessary estimates of the fair value of goodwill are determined using several factors and assumptions including but not limited to industry pricing multiples and estimated cash flows based upon valleys goodwill impairment testing the fair values of its three reporting units wealth management consumer banking and commercial banking were in excess of their carrying values no assurance can be given that we will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in the future and any such impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition at december our goodwill totaled billion see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information our market share and income may be adversely affected by our inability to successfully compete against larger and more diverse financial service providers digital fintech startup firms and other financial services providers that have advanced technological capabilities valley faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than valley to deal with the potential negative changes in the financial markets and regulatory landscape many of these competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints broader geographic service areas greater capital and in some cases lower cost structures valley competes with other providers of financial services such as commercial and savings banks savings and loan associations credit unions money market and mutual funds mortgage companies title agencies asset managers insurance companies and a large list of other local regional and national institutions which offer financial services additionally the financial services industry is facing a wave of digital disruption from fintech companies and other large financial services providers the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services which increase efficiency and enable financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs these competitors provide innovative webbased solutions to traditional retail table start form 10k table end banking services and products fintech companies tend to have stronger operating efficiencies and fewer regulatory burdens than their traditional bank counterparts including valley regulatory changes may continue to allow new entrants into the markets in which we operate the result of these regulatory changes will likely cause other nontraditional financial services companies to compete directly with valley many of the companies have stronger operating efficiencies and fewer regulatory burdens than their traditional bank counterparts including valley our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as a result of covid19 many customers have become more reliant on and their expectations have increased with respect to this technology we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers and service interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws many of valleys competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements valley may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on valleys business and in turn valleys financial condition and results of operations failure to successfully implement our growth strategies could cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses which may not be recouped and adversely affect our future profitability from time to time valley may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed valley may invest significant time and resources to develop and market new lines of business andor products and services initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting customer preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service additionally any new line of business andor new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of valleys system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on valleys business results of operations and financial condition our investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations we invest in certain taxadvantaged investments that support qualified affordable housing projects community development and prior to renewable energy resources our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits over specified time periods third parties perform diligence on these investments for us on which we rely both at inception and on an ongoing basis we are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level may fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and may not be able to be realized the possible inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits may have a negative impact on our financial results the risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside our control including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed we previously invested in mobile solar generators sold and leased back by dc solar and its affiliates dc solar dc solar had its assets frozen in december by the us department of justice dc solar and related entities are in chapter bankruptcy a group of investors who purchased mobile solar generators from and leased them back to dc solar including us received tax credits for making these renewable resource investments during the fourth quarter several of the coconspirators pleaded guilty to fraud in the ongoing federal investigation based upon this new information valley deemed that its tax positions related to the dc solar funds did not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold in valleys tax reserve assessment at december as a result our net income for the year ended december included an increase to our provision for income taxes of million reflecting the reserve for uncertain tax liability positions related to tax credits and other tax benefits previously recognized from the investments in the dc solar funds plus interest the principals pled guilty to fraud in early during the internal revenue service commenced an audit connected with our investment in dc solar and the audit remains open at this time while we believe that valley was fully reserved for the tax positions related to dc solar at december we continue to evaluate all our existing tax positions each quarter under us gaap table start form 10k table end we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property during the ordinary course of business we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans in doing so there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if hazardous or toxic substances are found we may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property in addition future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review prior to originating certain commercial real estate loans as well as before initiating any foreclosure action on real property these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we may incur future losses in connection with repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market we engage in the origination of residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market while typically retaining the loan servicing in connection with such sales we make representations and warranties which if breached may require us to repurchase such loans substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans the aggregate principal balances of residential mortgage loans serviced by the bank for others approximated billion and billion at december and respectively over the past several years we have experienced a nominal amount of repurchase requests and only a few of which have actually resulted in repurchases by valley nine and five loan repurchases in and respectively none of the loan repurchases resulted in a material loss as of december no reserves pertaining to loans sold were established on our financial statements while we currently believe our repurchase risk remains low based upon our careful loan underwriting and documentation standards it is possible that requests to repurchase loans could occur in the future and such requests may have a negative financial impact on us interest rate swap fees within capital markets income are a significant component of our noninterest income and could fluctuate in future periods valley executes interest rate swaps with commercial lending customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies interest rate swap fees reported within capital markets income totaled approximately million or percent and million or percent of total noninterest income for the years ended december and respectively while we believe our commercial loan customers will continue to use interest rate swap for managing interest rate risk several factors including but not limited to the actual and expected level of market interest rates can impact their decision to use such products as a result we can provide no assurance that our interest rate swap fees will remain at the level reported for the year ended december we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them in particular due to an increasingly competitive labor market the labor market continues to experience elevated levels of turnover in the aftermath of the covid19 pandemic and we have been impacted by an extremely competitive labor market including increased competition for talent across all aspects of our business as well as increased competition with nontraditional competitors such as fintech companies employers are offering increased compensation and opportunities to work with greater flexibility including remote work on a permanent basis these can be important factors in a current associates decision to leave us as well as in a prospective associates decision to join us as competition for skilled professionals remains intense we may have to devote significant resources to attract and retain qualified personnel which could negatively impact earnings the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel including but not limited to the executive officers disclosed in item of this annual report could have a material adverse impact on our business because we would lose the employees skills knowledge of the market and years of industry experience and may have difficulty promptly finding qualified replacement personnel table start form 10k table end we are subject to risks relating to environmental social and governance esg matters that could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations as well as the price of our common and preferred stock we are subject to a variety of risks including reputational risk associated with esg matters the public holds diverse and often conflicting views on these matters we have multiple stakeholders including our shareholders clients associates federal and state regulatory authorities and the communities in which we operate and these stakeholders will often have differing priorities and expectations regarding esg issues if we take action in conflict with one or another of those stakeholders expectations we could experience an increase in client complaints a loss of business or reputational harm we could also face negative publicity or reputational harm based on the identity of those with whom we choose to do business any adverse publicity in connection with esg issues could damage our reputation ability to attract and retain clients and associates compete effectively and grow our business in addition proxy advisory firms and certain institutional investors who manage investments in public companies are increasingly integrating esg factors into their investment analysis the consideration of esg factors in making investment and voting decisions is relatively new accordingly the frameworks and methods for assessing esg policies are not fully developed vary considerably among the investment community and will likely continue to evolve over time moreover the subjective nature of methods used by various stakeholders to assess a company with respect to esg criteria could result in erroneous perceptions or a misrepresentation of our actual esg policies and practices organizations that provide ratings information to investors on esg matters may also assign unfavorable ratings to us certain of our clients might also require that we implement additional esg procedures or standards in order to continue to do business with them if we fail to comply with specific esgrelated investor or client expectations and standards or to provide the disclosure relating to esg issues that any third parties may believe is necessary or appropriate regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so our reputation business financial condition andor results of operations as well as the price of our common and preferred stock could be negatively impacted climate change and severe weather could significantly impact our ability to conduct our business there is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters the physical risks of climate change include discrete events such as flooding and wildfires and longerterm shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat seal level rise and more frequent and prolonged drought such events could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from market volatility additionally transitioning to a lowcarbon economy may entail extensive policy legal technology and market initiatives a significant portion of our primary markets is located near coastal waters which could generate naturally occurring severe weather or in response to climate change which could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business many areas in new jersey new york florida and alabama in which the vast majority of our branches and offices operate are subject to severe flooding from time to time and significant disruptions related to the weather may become common events in the future heavy storms and hurricanes can also cause severe property damage and result in business closures negatively impacting both the financial health of retail and commercial customers and our ability to operate our business the risk of significant disruption and potential losses from future storm activity exists in all of our primary markets risks related to our industry changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings valleys earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and investment securities and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond valleys control including general economic conditions competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the policies of the federal reserve changes in interest rates driven by such factors could influence not only the interest valley receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect i valleys ability to originate loans and obtain deposits ii the fair value of valleys financial assets including the held to maturity and available for sale investment securities portfolios and iii the average duration of valleys interestearning assets and liabilities this also includes the risk that interestearning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interestbearing liabilities or vice versa repricing risk the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period basis risk and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interestearning asset and interestbearing liability maturities yield curve risk the federal reserve maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between and percent during beginning in march the federal reserve table start form 10k table end significantly increased the target federal funds rate incrementally through resulting in a target range between and percent at december effectively increasing interest rates during the first quarter the federal reserve increased the target federal funds rate another percent and may further increase the target federal funds rate in in an attempt to reduce inflation any substantial or unexpected change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on valleys financial condition and results of operations see additional information in the net interest income and interest rate sensitivity sections of our mda we may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis which could expose us to additional liability and could have a material adverse effect on us we are required to comply with antimoney laundering antiterrorism and other laws and regulations in the united states these laws and regulations require us among other things to adopt and enforce knowyourcustomer policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities these laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision while we have adopted policies and procedures aimed at detecting and preventing the use of our banking network for money laundering and related activities those policies and procedures may not completely eliminate instances in which we may be used by customers to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities to the extent we fail to fully comply with applicable laws and regulations the occ along with other banking agencies have the authority to impose fines and other penalties and sanctions on us in addition our business and reputation could suffer if customers use our banking network for money laundering or illegal or improper purposes the replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate may have an impact on valleys business financial condition or results of operations the adjustable interest rate libor act the libor act is a federal law that was passed march to permit financing agreements that contain a liborbased benchmark without inadequate fallback provisions to be automatically replaced once libor ceases by a benchmark replacement recommended by the federal reserve on december the federal reserve adopted a final rule implementing the libor act that among other things identifies the applicable sofrbased benchmark replacements under the libor act the libor act preempts similar state laws such as the new york state statute providing for recommended benchmark replacements for contracts governed by new york law without adequate fallback provisions us dollar libor rates will continue to be published until june to allow adequate time for legacy libor based financing to move to an alternate reference interest rate sofr is considered to be a risk free rate and libor was a risk weighted rate thus sofr tends to be a lower rate than libor because it does not contain a risk component the difference may negatively impact valleys interest rate margin utilizing sofr as compared to libor we no longer use libor as an index for any new loan originations and commenced its changeover of legacy libor based financing to alternate indexes the implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under loan agreements with borrowers may cause us to incur expenses related to the transition may result in reduced loan interest income borrowers may dispute substitute index indices or equalization credit spread adjustments some disputes with borrowers over the appropriateness or comparability to libor of the substitute index or indices may result in litigation the interest rate differences costs associated with the indices changeover from libor to sofr and the limited potential for litigation related to the cessation of libor may have an adverse impact to valley these consequences cannot be entirely predicted and may impact the market value for or value of liborlinked securities loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us higher chargeoffs and weak credit conditions could require us to further increase our allowance for credit losses through a provision charge to earnings the process for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is critical to our financial results and conditions it requires difficult subjective and complex judgments about the future including the impact of national and regional economic conditions on the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans if our judgment proves to be incorrect our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover the lifetime credit losses inherent in our loan and held to maturity debt securities portfolios as well as unfunded credit commitments deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers including as a result of inflationary pressures or other macroeconomic factors resulting from the covid19 pandemic or otherwise new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses additionally bank regulators review the classification of our loans in their examination of us and we may be required in the future to change the internal classification on certain loans which may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan chargeoffs if actual net chargeoffs were to exceed valleys allowance its earnings would be negatively impacted by additional provisions for credit losses any table start form 10k table end increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan chargeoffs as required by the occ or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition an increase in our nonperforming assets may reduce our interest income and increase our net loan chargeoffs provision for loan losses and operating expenses nonperforming assets including nonaccrual loans other real estate owned and other repossessed assets totaled million at december our nonaccrual loans represented percent of total loans at december and included nonaccrual taxi medallion loans totaling million with related reserves of million or percent of such loans within the allowance for loan losses these nonperforming assets can adversely affect our net income mainly through decreased interest income and increased operating expenses incurred to maintain such assets or loss charges related to subsequent declines in the estimated fair value of foreclosed assets adverse changes in the value of our nonperforming assets or the underlying collateral or in the borrowers performance or financial conditions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition potential further declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions and the stressed operating environment within new york city due to the covid19 pandemic increases in crime or other factors could also negatively impact the future performance of this portfolio there can be no assurance that we will not experience increases in nonperforming loans in the future or that our nonperforming assets will not result in lower financial returns in the future we may be required to consult with the federal reserve bank frb before declaring cash dividends on our common stock which ultimately may delay reduce or eliminate such dividends and adversely affect the market price of our common stock holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so we may reduce or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future depending upon our results of operations financial condition or other metrics which could be adversely impacted by the factors described in this item including the potential ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic and the uncertain us economic conditions in july the frb updated its supervisory guidance to provide greater clarity regarding the situations in which bank holding companies like valley may expect an expedited consultation in connection with the declaration of dividends that exceed quarterly earnings to qualify amongst other criteria total commercial real estate loan concentrations cannot represent percent or more of total capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio cannot increase by percent or more during the prior months currently we believe that valley does not meet the standard for expedited consultation and approval of its dividend should it be required as a result valley could be subject to a lengthier and possibly more burdensome review process by the frb when considering paying dividends that exceed quarterly earnings the delay reduction or elimination of our quarterly dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock see additional information regarding our quarterly cash dividend and the current rate of earnings retention in the capital adequacy section of the mda general commercial operational and financial and regulatory risks our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented which may result in a material adverse effect on our business results of

well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we rely on our systems of controls and procedures and if our system fails our operations could be disrupted we face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures including those to mitigate the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders may prove to be inadequate or are circumvented thereby causing delays in detection of errors or inaccuracies in data and information we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain

to disruptions of our systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control including for example electrical or telecommunications outages which may give rise to losses in service to customers and to financial loss or liability we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as us and to the risk that our or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate we maintain a system of comprehensive policies and a control framework designed to monitor vendor risks including among other things i changes in the vendors organizational structure or internal controls ii changes in the vendors financial condition iii changes in the vendors support for existing products and services and iv changes in the vendors strategic focus while we believe these policies and procedures help to mitigate risk the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and in turn our financial condition and results of operations our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the outbreak of pandemic disease acts of terrorism and other external events the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics such as covid19 could lead to additional quarantines business shutdowns labor shortages disruptions to supply chains and overall economic instability additionally new york city and new jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism against the united states such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses although we have established and regularly test disaster recovery policies and procedures the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our ability to make opportunistic acquisitions is subject to significant risks including the risk that regulators will not provide the requisite approvals we may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks branches financial institutions or related businesses from time to time that we expect may further our business strategy any possible acquisition will be subject to regulatory approval and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approval in a timely manner or at all even if we obtain regulatory approval these acquisitions could involve numerous risks including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs difficulties related to integration diversion of managements attention from other business activities changes in relationships with

quality deterioration at acquired institutions competition for acquisitions can be intense and we may not be able to acquire other institutions on attractive terms there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing or will even pursue future acquisitions or if such transactions are completed that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses into operations ability to grow may be limited if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future the cecl model for determining our allowance for credit losses could add volatility to our provision for credit losses and earnings the current expected credit loss cecl model requires the allowance for credit losses for certain financial assets including loans held to maturity securities and certain offbalance sheet credit exposures to be calculated based on current expected credit losses over the lives of the assets rather than incurred losses as of a point in time our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance accordingly our actual lifetime credit losses may be materially different than the amounts reported in the allowance due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process including future loss estimates based upon our reasonable and supportable economic forecasts also future credit losses could differ materially from those estimates due to changes in values and circumstances after the balance sheet date changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance provision for credit losses and earnings we may be unable to adequately manage our liquidity risk which could

understanding its financial results and condition some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of valleys assets or liabilities and financial results valley identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain under each of these policies it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions using different assumptions or as new information becomes available from time to time the fasb and the sec change their guidance governing the form and content of valleys external financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change or even reverse
