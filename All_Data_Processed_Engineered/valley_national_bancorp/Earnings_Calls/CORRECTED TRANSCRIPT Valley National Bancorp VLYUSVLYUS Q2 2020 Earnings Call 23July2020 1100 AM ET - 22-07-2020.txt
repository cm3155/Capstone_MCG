call this morning i will provide some perspective on valleys strong yeartodate performance in the context of a challenging operating environment mike will offer additional details on the financial results before opening the call to your questions on our earnings call in april we outlined organizational efforts to support our employees clients and communities amidst the covid19 pandemic but i will not reiterate each of those efforts this morning i will provide an update on a few key highlights that speak to valleys culture performance and value proposition valley originated over billion of loans under the paycheck protection program approximately of these loans were for balances below and our median originated loan size was just while these numbers reflect the macro overview of the program they only broadly speak to the external community impact more specifically we estimate that loans facilitated by valley employees help preserve over jobs within our marketplace equally important nearly of our ppp loans were provided to minorityowned businesses nonprofits or womenowned small businesses with a purposeful direction our ppp response was differentiated by our high touch service which leveraged in internally developed digital process made possible by the efforts and commitment of our employees as we begin to transition to loan forgiveness more hard work is ahead of us we remain committed to helping our clients understand the changing regulations around the program and to easing the forgiveness process for these small businesses we believe valley will continue to distinguish ourselves from our peers through this process by providing a unique customer experience led by people and supported by best inclass technology todate valley has granted over loan deferrals totaling approximately billion weve closely monitored the actions of our borrowers that have reached the end of their first deferral period approximately loans totaling billion have completed their initial deferral period and have returned to regular scheduled payments meanwhile only of commercial deferrals scheduled to return to repayment requested an additional deferral while new york and new jersey were hit hard very early in the stage of the pandemic the covid cases trends in these markets have improved significantly these markets continue to progress towards a more complete reopening earlier than many other markets in the country meanwhile florida now faces a deteriorating health crisis similar to that experienced by new york and new jersey earlier in the year after working hard to reopen our branches we have returned our florida locations back to appointmentonly status we will continue to take the necessary steps to protect our employees and all of our clients in florida while we cannot control the environment around us valley continues to succeed by focusing on items that we can more actively manage in the second quarter of we reported net income of million and earnings per share of these results include over million of pretax expenses associated with covid19 pandemic on an adjusted basis pretax provision revenue increased from the first quarter benefiting from aggressive funding cost reductions that began late in the first quarter we remain keenly focused on generating positive operating leverage and optimizing performance on a year overyear basis we achieved approximately growth in adjusted revenue against just a increase in adjusted expenses our adjusted efficiency ratio was in the quarter while we expect revenue pressure to build across the industry we believe that additional expense levers exist at valley to help us mitigate these valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 challenges the quarters strong bottom line results include a million loan loss provision which was more than higher than the first quarters provision while our underlying credit trends remain stable the economic outlook related to covid19 is absolutely uncertain we continue to probably build our loan loss allowance to reflect this uncertainty has presented challenges that no one could have predicted at the beginning of the year despite this we are extremely proud of all of our accomplishments and performance yeartodate funding cost reductions and expense management have accelerated our preprovision profitability gains and enable us to absorb higher loan loss provisions required under cecl we will continue to conservatively navigate these challenging times and well position ourselves for success as the environment normalizes now id like to turn the call over to mike hagedorn for some of the quarters additional financial highlights michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you ira turning to slide highlighting our quarterly net interest income and margin trends valleys reported net interest margin was versus in the first quarter of our decision to hold a higher cash balance in the quarter impacted our margin by approximately basis points exclusive of this our net interest margin would have increased for the third consecutive quarter reflecting the positive impact of our aggressive funding cost reductions on a sequential basis our cost of interestbearing liabilities improved by basis points to and our interest expense declined by approximately we had previously identified the meaningful and unique funding cost reduction opportunity available to us we were able to capitalize on this opportunity which enabled us to absorb asset yield pressures and drive strong net interest income growth from the prior quarter while a significant amount of our repricing opportunity has been captured already slide identifies the amount of retail cds expected to mature in the next months at rates well above current offering rates specifically over the next three quarters we have roughly billion of retail cds returning at cost around or above slide illustrates the significant reduction in deposit costs achieved over the last few months on a quarterly basis our interestbearing deposit cost declined basis points to our allin cost of funds improved to from in the first quarter due to deposit cost reductions and significant noninterestbearing growth while cd costs declined basis points sequentially there may be room to further reduce those costs as illustrated on slide in the third quarter we have billion of retail cds maturing at a cost of from a balance perspective total deposits increased billion or approximately sequentially excluding roughly billion of ppprelated deposits at the end of june sequential deposit growth was importantly noninterestbearing deposits increased in the quarter or approximately exclusive of ppp deposits we continue to experience the customer rotation out of cds and into more flexible and lower cost transaction accounts with branches partially unavailable customers have continued to migrate towards our online and mobile banking channels the count of new online banking users in the second quarter more than doubled from the first quarter in the first quarter we outlined a variety of steps that we undertook to bolster our liquidity position at june our cash and equivalents totaled billion up from billion at march we continue to believe that holding excess liquidity is prudent given the uncertain environment that we currently face from an average balance perspective we held roughly billion of excess liquidity during the quarter we estimate this excess liquidity dragged on our net interest margin by approximately basis points valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 slide details our loan portfolio and the asset yield pressure that we have been experiencing along with other banks in the industry during the quarter loan yields declined basis points we attributed approximately basis points of decline to ppp loans and the normalization of pcd accretion income from an elevated level in the first quarter total loans of billion included roughly billion of outstanding ppp loans at the end of the quarter excluding these ppp balances total loans declined approximately on an annualized basis as economic activity has weighed on loan demand in our markets on a yeartodate basis we have seen solid activity in our commercial real estate segments while nonmortgage consumer balances continue to decline commercial line utilization returned to a more normal following a modest uptick to at the end of the first quarter while traditional lending activity in our footprint has slowed we were very active in the sba paycheck protection program as outlined on slide as of midjuly we had originated approximately ppp loans with an aggregate balance of billion approximately of the ppp loans that we originated were for amounts less than while regulations governing this program have been in flux we continue to believe that approximately of the loans that we have originated will be forgiven and off our balance sheet by the end of the year in total we expect to receive more than million of loan origination fees associated with our ppp activity slide updates our exposure to industries which we believe have primary or secondary pandemic exposure approximately billion or of our nonppp loans are to industries that have primary exposure to the pandemic these industries include nonessential doctor and surgery centers the hospital and food service industries and retail companies we also have identified our exposure to industries such as manufacturing and education which may be less impacted by the virus in total we have closely monitored the performance of these lending segments and have been pleased with our borrowers resiliency while approved deferrals in these categories totaled approximately million you can see that current active deferrals were only million this is the result of borrowers in these industries coming off deferral and returning to current or paying status moving onto slide our noninterest income increased from the linked quarter driven primarily by strength in loan sale gains and stable swap revenue adjusted fee income ticked up to of total revenue from in the prior quarter despite strong fee income growth fees as a percentage of revenue remains below our target primarily as a result of continued strong net interest income growth we remain focused on growing diverse revenue streams over time and enhancing customer adoption of the various financial products that we offer swap fees were nearly million during the quarter as we originated backtoback swaps on approximately million of notional loans while traditional lending activity slowed in the quarter our borrowers continued to demand the interest rate protection provided by our swap offerings our net residential mortgage gain on sale income increased approximately sequentially the increase included million for the change in fair value of loans held for sale and further reflected both higher loan sale volumes and gain on sale margin expansion residential loans sold totaled million for the period up from million in the linked quarter while the gain on sale margin increased basis points to slide provides an overview of our quarterly operating expenses and the continued improvement in our efficiency ratio our expenses on both the reported and adjusted basis increased modestly from the prior quarter valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 adjusted expenses exclusive of de minimis merger charges and million of tax credit amortization totaled million this was up million or approximately from the prior quarter adjusted expenses include approximately million of costs associated with covid19 and roughly million of periodic technology costs related to our ongoing core system upgrade our adjusted efficiency ratio continue to improve coming in at in the quarter versus for the march period as ira mentioned on a yearoveryear basis we have generated revenue growth with only a increase in adjusted operating expenses we remain focused on expense management and are looking to identify potential opportunities to reduce expenses where possible for example it is possible that changing employee work patterns and customer behaviors may lead to further cost reduction opportunities turning to slide in asset quality our allowance for credit losses increased million to of loans from in the first quarter the allowance represents of nonppp loans roughly times higher than our reserved level at the end of the quarters reserve build reflects a million provision and nearly million of net chargeoffs net chargeoffs increased million from the prior quarter this increase is largely attributable to an million floridabased restaurant loan that came to valley in the prior acquisition this borrower faced significant challenges prior to the covid19 outbreak and became further stressed during the pandemic while we have increased our focus on the restaurant exposure within our portfolio we do not view this loan as indicative of an outsized stress in our restaurant portfolio or in our florida loan book taxi medallion loan chargeoffs also increased to million in the quarter reflective of another downward revaluation of medallions the taxi loan portfolio stands at million and carries a specific reserve the reserve build in excess of net chargeoffs reflects updated economic forecasts within our cecl model our cecl model remains conservatively weighted towards moodys adverse and prolonged recession scenarios as a result of the uncertain economic outlook our model reflects some amount of gdp recovery in the third quarter of followed by gdp declines in the beginning of with a slow recovery throughout that year we also expect unemployment to climb above in early and remain in double digits for the foreseeable future future provisioning activity will be largely dependent on the degree that economic outcomes track our expectations nonaccrual loans increased million or reflecting modest increases in the cre and residential real estate portfolios as a percentage of total loans nonaccruals declined to from in the first quarter in addition we saw a significant improvement in our accruing past due loans which normalized to from of total loans in the prior quarter you can see the growth in our tangible book value and capital ratios on slide tangible book value has increased in the last months our tangible common equity ratio declined to from at march the billion of ppp loans and our excess liquidity position reduced our tangible common equity to total asset ratio by approximately basis points in the quarter we continue to feel good about our capital levels and believe that the sequential growth in our riskbased capital ratios illustrate our improving ability to increase our capital levels on an organic basis with that ill turn the call back over to ira for some closing commentary ira d robbins president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 thanks mike the headline risk of covid19 has somewhat overshadowed valleys extremely strong yearto date performance we have produced significant positive operating leverage which has led to a meaningful improvement in our preprovision profitability over the last few years valley has become a more dynamic and nimble institution and we remain wellpositioned to serve the diverse financial needs of our clients i am extremely proud of the immense effort put in by our team and know that this hard work will continue to pay off for our company and our shareholders with that id now like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin qa thank you question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of frank schiraldi with piper sandler your line is now open frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies good morning michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp frank frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies just wanted to ask on deferrals i mean looking at the presentation it really does seem pretty remarkable looking at sort of some of the highly sensitive areas like hotels and then how much those deferrals indiscernible have come down indiscernible already but i just want to ask about florida indiscernible that hotel occupancy rates in florida were quite high in the early stages of the pandemic im assuming indiscernible so i was just wondering your thoughts about and what youve seen so far in terms of deferral requests down there and how do you anticipate that might trend thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp sure frank its tom iadanza ill try my best to piece together the question youre breaking up a little bit as slide pointed out we had total deferrals at high point of billion billion of that was commercial related and billion of that billion is secured by real estate there is no significance by region every region was distributed a third to floridaalabama and twothirds to new yorknew jersey which is our distribution of our total loan portfolio and on the florida side it does have the predominant level of leisure and hotel hospitality portfolio but i will tell you of that portfolio we have million of deferred loans million met that first 90day expiration period and of that amount million went back to full pay thats our hotel experience and our total hotel book is million so of that hotel deferral went back to full pay after days okay so were encouraged by the trends and give you a little bit more highlight because the experience is broad based were seeing that within new york new jersey florida and alabama look at that retail book we have which is another high profile high risk component that we consider high risk component we had let me indiscernible valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 of that retail go back to full pay million met that 90day period and million went back to full pay so that was a experience again no different in florida than new york and alabama frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies so even now with indiscernible youre not seeing any change thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp no no keep in mind all of it is secured were predominately flagged based on our hotels we have personal guarantees these are people who weve done business with long time who have weathered cycles in the past or we conservatively underwrite the average loan to value on that portfolio was at origination and the debt service coverage was times prepandemic so we believe there was a bit of a cushion in there before we even have to get and rely on the guarantees but the guarantors are stepping up and theyre relatively liquid people for the most part ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp frank this is ira i think on an anecdotal basis getting to i think the point of your comment is in our conversations with many of our borrowers down to the florida footprint i think some of the headlines in the newspapers are really disconnected with what theyre seeing from an experience perspective as occupancy rates really havent changed that much frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp and we dont do the sorry frank we dont have the frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies no no go ahead indiscernible thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp its mostly around travel and tourism frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay and then just lastly just the nim if i set aside liquidity it seems like with the cds coming up for a repricing still are you guys confident in core nim expansion and nii expansion from here into valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah frank this is mike well i wouldnt say core nim expansion necessarily i would say nim protection so i think as the slide shows that weve used many times i think its slide if im not mistaken yes that opportunity to reprice a lot of our funding sources gives us the ability to offset the reductions that we are going to see on the earning asset side and dont forget that part of that liquidity build that i referenced in my prepared remarks is a result that we are essentially not buying any new fixed income securities for our investment portfolio and think of that as basically insurance because i think the cash flows we would buy today are pretty much the same cash flows wed buy in the not too distant future and so were going to try to stay liquid in the hopes that maybe this covid situation gets better and well see some slightly upward tick in interest rates operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is now open alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning this is alex lau on for steve michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i just had a question on fee income so its down a bit from your waived fees for the quarter can you just talk about what youre doing on that front and what do you expect for the rest of the year thanks ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp i think right off the bat consistent with many other banks in the country we elected to waive fees for many of our customers that were impacted by covid19 that said it is a small component of the entire noninterest income base and we have gone back to adjusting fee schedule accordingly alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator our next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw your line is now open collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning everyone ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp good morning collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc mike maybe if we could just start on the nim just to follow up your with your comment about liquidity just how youre positioning yourself on the deposit side so just to understand the intention is to keep it to maintain that liquidity and im just trying to draw that with because i presume a lot of that came from the ppp deposits and how youre thinking of the ultimate outflow on that so just if you could kind of walk through some of the moving parts on how youre seeing some of that the liquidity movement michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so on the first part of your question as you might have noticed from the prior comments we made in the first quarter we have released some of that liquidity already roughly around million so far so the goal isnt to hold onto that kind of indefinitely and i think youll see us selectively use that where we think it makes sense so i cant promise you that were going to do that in the third quarter necessarily we may but no were not going to hold onto those higher levels longer term and basically when this thing started out liquidity was obviously the biggest risk i think now the liquidity risk relative to the industry is abated quite a bit collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and then the second part of your question collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah just on the ppp side so were hearing kind of mixed things in terms of what the ultimate borrower kind of usage is of those dollars but how are you sort of expecting kind of the noninterestbearing deposit flows to go as it relates to the ppp deposits that built this quarter michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so we had originally forecast that wed start to see some of that in the third quarter at least in a meaningful way and now i think thats going to be pushed off to maybe fourth quarter to first quarter of next year and keep in mind those yields based upon the size of them because the fee income is different and fee income accretes through there is roughly around for us so its a little bit its obviously less than the portfolio but its getting pretty close to where new loan volume is coming on as well thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 yeah and collyn its tom i just want to add that of our ppp loans were to customers previously not with valley we generated approximately million in deposits that were nonppp loanrelated deposits with that group and with an opportunity to solicit for even more we have an active program going after that based on what we now have as new prospects to generate even more deposits in business from that operator our next question comes from steven duong with rbc capital markets your line is now open steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning guys ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc just a question on your reserves the basis points now thats almost double your fourth quarter level so with cecl that basically implies that youre looking at about basis points of credit loss through the cycle and the assumption is based on a doubledigit unemployment rate through is that right michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so i wont specifically address the basis points but im going to point you back to the fact that the model is incredibly sensitive to the economic forecast most likely and most impactful impacts are on gdp and unemployment and so ill tell you the percentages that we used so you can get a better feel as to where that comes out on a weighted average basis so for the second quarter we used moodys june estimates and we used for their s3 scenario for s4 and for baseline and to give you an idea of how the dispersion is different between those baseline had gdp for third quarter coming in at and s4 has it at so on a weighted average basis its positive now when you look at the forward next seven quarters it goes negative in the fourth quarter it goes negative in the first quarter and as i said in my prepared remarks the unemployment rate is above whereas in prior estimates that was more around when you start to look forward so its gotten worse on the unemployment side and its gotten less optimistic if you will on the gdp side steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and i guess how is like your reserve level compared to where you guys were in the financial crisis ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp this is ira i think its really got to be aggregated together with even where our capital position was so when we went into the last financial crisis we started with the tce number about were seeing today on an adjusted basis if you account for liquidity as well as the ppp loans as close to so were about basis points more in capital today than when we went into the initial financial crisis on the coverage ratio with regard to valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 the overall loan portfolio we think were in a real solid position as well so on an aggregate basis we think we have a lot more reserves from a capital and provision perspective than what we did last time operator our next question comes from matthew breese with stephens your line is now open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey just in regards to the provision how much of the million was qualitatively driven how does that compare to last quarter and then with more stability in the moodys forecast should we view the majority of the reserve build in the rearview mirror at this point and provisioning level should start to just reflect growth in charge offs michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so the qualitative part was not a large portion of the million and as it relates to your second part of your question personally i think you might see people i dont think valley is the only institution that will do this i think there might be some less reliance on the baseline as you can see even from our weightings we only used for the baseline this time because i think generally people believe this might last a little bit longer and so if you get that economic impact into your model you might heavily weight so that would be a bigger driver i think of future reserve build as i said earlier than just changes per se to the moodys estimate itll impact it but i think the weightings will be a bigger impact matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood and then on the expense front you point to million of covid expenses this quarter million last quarter a lot of that is in regards to readiness should we start to see these figures start to wind down and therefore expenses can start to flatten out or come down and then you also mentioned potential room for expense saves could you just talk about some of the areas where you see thats possible and to what extent michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so on the million to give you some breakdown on that numbers roughly of that is related to enhanced cleaning procedures that weve had to do and that is going to be directly correlated to outbreaks and hotspots within our footprint so over time you would hope that that would come down theres some marketing valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 related costs and i suppose you could argue whether those are covid related or not but theyre specifically related to our recovery cd that we have launched and weve also launched a phase of that as well and then also inside of there that i dont believe will be recurring at least in any material way our expenses related to getting ourselves opened up to the various waive process that were using things like decals on the floor of elevators signage in different places plexiglass sneeze guards in certain locations all of that is in that number as well and that should over time reduce itself ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp and matt this is ira i just think following up on your second comment we still believe that there is significant opportunity to relook at our business model and improve the operating efficiency further i think as we continue to enhance the technology platform that we sit on there will be operational saves as we continue to move over across all facets of the organization if you recall about two years ago we presented to you what branch transformation look like at valley up until this point we probably exceeded some of them the metrics and numbers that we provided to you if you notice we didnt provide anything this time an update we think its prudent for us to really reassess the entire platform that we have within the organization when it comes to real estate expenses and we continue to look at that and is there more opportunity to look at real estate and not just from a branch perspective but from a corporate perspective as well in addition theres probably a little bit left on the oritani operator operator instructions we have a followup question from the line of collyn gilbert with kbw your line is now open collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks guys sorry i wasnt finished i could probably ask questions for three hours but id try to keep it brief so mike sorry just indiscernible on the nim so you had indicated that there may be room on the retail deposit side to lower again it seems like theres more than maybe room what would keep you from being more aggressive in dropping some of those retail cd costs michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp no i said that there may be some room thats probably just me doing my normal hedging probably there is absolutely and thats what slide shows but those rates that youre seeing in the third quarter as an example for maturing cds bps for borrowing and bcds at bps we know that at todays rates well be able to buy those same funding sources at lower rates so absolutely were going to continue to see that the issue around saying a specific number is especially with the cd book it depends on what maturity we want to do weve been as this whole thing has been going on kind of silently weve been building a nice ladder and extending out some of our longer term deposits ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp and i think collyn when you look at the overall deposit book i think we get criticized a bit based on the cost of deposits within the organization i know a lot of that is a function of the market that we operate within but we were very very aggressive compared to many of our peers in dropping rates i mean our cost of deposits including noninterestbearing went to basis points this quarter from basis points the quarter before and basis points a year ago so we dropped just on a linkedquarter basis we didnt have any account valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 attrition in reality we increased units of noninterestbearing accounts during the quarter i think it shows the stickiness of the types of deposits we have and were real excited about the opportunity michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah and to iras point i would point you to slide and take a look at the savings now in money market accounts and the growth there i think that illustrates what hes talking about collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful and then just some clarity on some of the fee movement so first in terms of just your outlook on mortgage banking and where you see that trending kind of in the back half of the year if theres a lot of pull through that happened in the second quarter or if you expect activity to sort of remain elevated as we move into the back half of the year thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp hey collyn its tom yeah when you look at our second quarter of our business was conforming for sale mortgage balance was general the refinance market is active is strong as you would expect in this interest rate environment we are pulling through on a similar basis so far in the third quarter our pipeline remains somewhat elevated from id say first quarter similar to where the same line in second quarters we were as we are now operator we have a followup question from the line of matthew breese with stephens your line is now open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc just one more for me guys just in terms of the deferrals i think you said there was a cure rate on the commercial loans that came up what was that on the consumer side and is there any reason to believe that blended cure rate is not something we should apply to the remaining billion of deferrals thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah indiscernible matt its tom we had million on the residential mortgage fees approximately million of that came due requested second and keep in mind we do plus so requested a second deferral went on to full pay on our auto piece which is the bulk of the balance of our consumer we had million in total million came up at that met that first period million went on full pay so that was so i think were going to be those percentages again i think are in line with what we would have expected to see in those two categories ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp and matt i just think this speaks to the volume as to who valley is and how we underwrite and the real differentiation here of our borrowers versus many of our peers valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood thank you very much i appreciate the followup ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thank you operator and that concludes todays questionandanswer session id like to turn the call back to mr robbins for closing remarks ira d robbins president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thank
