call over to ira robbins ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you travis and welcome to those of you on the call i have a few comments to make this morning and then we have tom to provide insight on the exceptional growth results that were achieved on both sides of the balance sheet this quarter mike will then discuss our financial results in more detail in the second quarter of valley reported net income of million earnings per share of and an annualized roa of exclusive of noncore charges including the provision expense mainly associated with bank leumis nonpcd loans adjusted net income eps and roa were million and respectively these exceptional results reflect significant organic loan and deposit growth and our ability to manage deposit betas in a generally supportive interest rate environment with the bank leumi transaction behind us and integration efforts well underway i want to take a moment to put valleys recent transformation into context beginning on slide of our deck we compare this quarters key financial metrics against the fourth quarter of this comparison highlights the tangible progress that has been made in the last years as we have executed on our strategic and tactical initiatives from a big picture perspective we have driven sustainable balance sheet growth diversified and enhanced our funding base established new noninterest revenue channels and benefited from disciplined and strategic ma we have grown organic loans and deposits by just below on an annualized basis over the last years while covid weighed on the results these growth rates have accelerated more recently we have achieved this growth by providing exceptional service and advice to our existing clients and proactively identifying growth opportunities in specific markets and business segments once these opportunities have been identified weve dedicated the appropriate resources from a talent product and technology perspective to ensure that we capture the available growth as growth has accelerated we have been careful to preserve the stringent underwriting standards that have supported our longstanding track record of belowpeer credit losses while we havent materially altered our underwriting standards our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans remains well above the day one reserve that was established upon the adoption of cecl meanwhile neither our earnings nor our capital have benefited from the reserve release that have recently been common across the industry still we have preserved our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio at without a ph dilutive capital raise while supporting the strong growth turning to slide you can see that our growth has also been extremely profitable quarterly adjusted net income has increased approximately million between the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of we are a much more profitable organization today as a result of strong growth in both spread based and noninterest income our adjusted roa during the quarter of represents a nearly 25basispoint increase since the fourth quarter of we recognize that our future operating performance would drive the trajectory of our valuation that said we provide this snapshot as proof of our ability to execute in challenging times valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 over the last years our tangible common equity and annualized earnings power have increased approximately billion and million respectively on a per share basis tangible book value and adjusted earnings per share have increased and we are proud of this performance and confident that our ability to execute will drive success in the next phase of our evolution finally as our preference is not to revisit our stated guidance on a quarterly basis we have attempted to be as transparent as possible given the backdrop of an extremely volatile economic and interest rate environment with a full quarter of post leumi results we thought it would be most helpful to provide combined guidance for the remainder of the year using the second quarters loan balance as a starting point we now anticipate between and annualized loan growth for the second half of we anticipate preserving our loantodeposit ratio around give or take based on these dynamics and the june forward rate curve we would anticipate generating aggregate net interest income of around million in the second half of the year finally we expect to achieve an efficiency ratio of below in the second half of as well with that i will turn the call over to tom and mike to discuss the quarters growth and financial results thomas a iadanza president valley national bancorp thank you ira on slide you can see a summary of the quarters exceptional loan growth for the quarter total loans increased approximately billion excluding approximately billion of loans acquired from bank leumi on april our combined organization generated nearly billion net growth during the quarter for legacy valley approximately of the quarters commercial originations were from existing customers loan growth was split approximately between our northern and southern regions growth was also well diversified across asset classes with residential real estate and consumer contributing a proportional increase to the quarters results we anticipate that residential and consumer activity will slow meaningfully for the remainder of the year ci loans grew nearly during the quarter or excluding loans acquired from bank leumi meanwhile cre loans grew during the quarter or excluding loans acquired from bank leumi while our pipeline remained strong at approximately billion which includes nearly billion for legacy bank leumi lenders underwriting standards have begun to tighten as rates have risen the strong first half results positioned us to meaningfully exceed the full year growth guidance that we presented previously finally on this slide you can see that origination yields increased approximately basis points during the quarter as you would expect origination yields increased each month as rates moved higher we anticipate that origination yields will continue to ascend as the fed raises rates turning to slide we are pleased that deposit growth is also very strong during the quarter total deposits increased nearly billion with approximately billion of that coming from bank leumi balances acquired on april organic deposit growth trends were strong during the quarter and benefited from activity in our niche national deposits and cannabis segments traditional commercial checking account growth remained strong and contributed to the increase in noninterest bearing deposits during the quarter we acknowledge that rapidly higher interest rates have created pressure in valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 certain segment of our deposit business however we have strategically built and acquired differentiated funding verticals for exactly this type of environment we are pleased with the deposit story and our ability to manage low betas across the portfolio to this point we continue to focus meaningful time and energy to the deposit gathering side of our business to ensure that deposit betas outperform our prior experience with that i will turn the call over to mike hagedorn to provide more insight on the quarters financials michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you tom slide illustrates valleys recent net interest income and margin trends net interest income increased over million from the linked quarter approximately million of this increase was from bank leumi sources the remaining organic increase was the result of strong organic loan growth and the impact of higher interest rates on our assetsensitive balance sheet our reported net interest margin increased basis points to from the first quarter of exclusive of the linkedquarter impact of ppp loans the margin expansion was closer to basis points the linkedquarter net interest margin increase also reflected a 33basispoint increase in earning asset yields driven by the repricing of our adjustable loans and higher yields on new originations inclusive of the benefit from higher noninterestbearing deposit balances valleys total cost of funds increased a modest basis points in the quarter we are very pleased with our ability to manage funding betas so far as tom mentioned though we are cognizant of competitive pressures around us and acknowledge that funding costs will remain in focus for the remainder of the year moving to slide we generated over million of noninterest income for the quarter as compared to million in the first quarter the increase was primarily the result of the bank leumi acquisition which enhanced wealth management and loan fees and foreign exchange revenue from an organic perspective the anticipated reduction in commercial loan swap revenue was largely offset by an increase in gains on mortgage loan sales it is likely that gainonsale revenue will decline from current levels but we are very excited about the growth opportunities that exist in other noninterest income areas including those contributed by bank leumi we are very pleased with the noninterest income growth we have achieved in the last few years and remain focused on maintaining our momentum on slide you can see that our noninterest expenses were approximately million for the quarter or million on an adjusted basis the linkedquarter increase in adjusted expenses was primarily the result of bank leumi and higher intangible amortization costs associated with the transaction legacy valley expense growth was relatively muted the quarters strong revenue growth helped drive our efficiency ratio to from in the first quarter as ira mentioned earlier we anticipate generating an efficiency ratio around for the second half of the year turning to slide you can see our credit trends for the last five quarters our allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans increased to at june from at march this level of reserve coverage remains well above the day one reserve we established upon the adoption of cecl neither our earnings nor capital levels have benefited from recent reserve releases which differentiates us from many of our peers valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 for the fourth consecutive quarter we recognized de minimis nonpcd net chargeoffs totaling just million approximately million of the million linkedquarter increase in nonaccrual loans were for loans acquired from bank leumi reported nonaccrual loans increased to from of total loans and remained well within our recent historical range on slide you can see that tangible book value declined approximately for the quarter this was mainly the result of the acquisition of bank leumi and the negative oci impact associated with our availableforsale securities portfolio relative to peers this oci headwind remains manageable as a result of our relatively small securities portfolio and modest afs exposure which reflects our continued focus on tangible book value preservation tangible common equity to tangible assets declined to from in the prior quarter primarily as a result of our organic loan growth our riskbased regulatory ratios declined at a somewhat faster pace as the average risk ph weighting for our loan portfolio ticked up as a result of the growth composition with that ill turn the call back to the operator to begin qa thank you question and answer section operator and thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from michael perito from kbw your line is now open michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning mike michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning mike michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc not to be nitpicky but just to clarify i heard two different things the efficiency guide is it below or at for the back half of the year and then maybe just a step below that can you give us any commentary youre willing to share about kind of the dollar expense run rate from here on a core basis and whether theres maybe some things that could impact that up or down as we look to the back half of the year ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 so ill give the updated guide it is below as to where we think the efficiency ratio will be for the second half of the year and then maybe ph michael talk a little bit about sort of what the focus is on the noninterest expense figure michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp sure thanks ira from an efficiency perspective were fairly confident in our guide given our outlook for revenue growth and well expect to lag expense growth and drive positive operating leverage through the second half of and keep in mind that the quarterly expense growth was entirely the result of the addition of bank leumis operations and higher intangible amortization costs which were up million over  so legacy valley expenses were effectively flat in the quarter michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and is there any kind of movement in some of like a deal closing and whether that i mean im sure you guys flagged a lot of it in that million of onetime but is there anything else that we should be mindful of that could normalize or maybe elevate it or nothing comes to mind travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp yeah mike this is travis so there are some additional integration costs associated with leumi which are kind of for the ongoing investments that we needed to make in our ongoing business things like rewiring their offices and other things those costs in the quarter were relatively minimal but those will decline over time and i think if you think about the trajectory of expenses from here there is some id say inflationbased increase that we anticipate to offset the majority of with further cost saves and efficiencies on the valley side michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and so no change to the kind of the cost saving expectations whether from a dollar amount or a timing standpoint at this time travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp no michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks for that and then on the deposit side appreciate toms comments about trying to keep the beta lower it sounds like some of the deposit niches are going to be really critical to that was curious if you guys are willing to maybe provide some micro updates on a handful of those venture banking i know i think you guys had discussed last quarter had some good growth obviously that market had a much more volatile second quarter just curious kind of where some of those deposit niches stand today and which opportunities then could be the most material near term thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 yeah michael its tom so ill give you some highlights there on the tech business the deposits were up since we announced the deal and yeartodate so we are seeing that continued growth there more importantly or no equally importantly our relationshipdriven strategy of driving our commercial deposits is working those deposits were up over million for the quarter that combined with our hoa cannabis and national deposit business all which are growing in doubledigit percentages are contributing to our ability to fund our loan growth michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and has the kind of cost of those niches has it been as resilient kind of as you would have expected or i mean obviously there are competitors looking for kind of lowercost deposit growth i mean are you seeing any change in that or do you still feel like theres some room for market share taking in several of those targeted niches thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp i mean ill answer a portion of them and then ira will chime in here on that commercially driven relationship part of that growth is noninterest bearing we expect that to continue ira if you want to comment ill take the others ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah and i think mike we made a real concerted effort over the last years to really focus on diversifying the funding book that we have so as certain segments of the deposit book become more beta sensitive we have alternatives to raise deposits from other niche categories some of the cannabis business obviously has a very low cost basis and even as tom mentioned on the tech business it was one thing we acquired bank leumis international tech business but weve organically decided to grow the domestic piece of it as well so we think we have enough different alternatives even from a retail funding perspective that provides us a pretty good segment and pretty good outlets to continue to raise the deposits that we need to support the active loan growth we have at a manageable rate from a funding perspective that we think will be much less than where we were last time around michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you and then just last from me and ill step back just on the kind of goforward provision and credit environment here loan growth obviously going to continue with the guide that you guys provided just at least as it stands today what type of kind of reserve are you allocating against incremental loan growth and is it is the unemployment rate still one of the bigger drivers of the cecl model here and the moodys forecast or is there anything else we should be mindful of as we try to think about how that will trend into whats obviously a pretty uncertain to months michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah ill take a crack at this valley now stands at and the median for banks is now so just like iras comments earlier regarding the change in deposit funding or funding in general how its not the ph valley of old you can see the allowances also that same way valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 the bias if you will in provisioning if all things were to stay equal which theyre probably not going to in the economy but if they did i would say the bias is towards even smaller provisions and heres why most of the loss history that would have been more negative than the current is dropping off right this is the pandemic related loss so the loss history is the largest driver of the model now having said that considering the loan growth that weve put up were going to continue to keep pace based on that loss history with any loan growth that we continue to book michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great appreciate the color guys thanks for taking my question ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from frank schiraldi from piper sandler your line is now open frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just want to follow up on the deposit side actually and im not sure if i missed this but in terms of the cannabis business where are balances at this point and i think you talked about maybe doubledigit growth just wondering where you think you can ramp that up since i assume its still pretty early in building out that business where do you think you can ramp that up call it by yearend ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah frank thanks for the question we really havent provided much guidance with regard to specific deposits and i think well probably keep it that way at this point i will tell you the number of accounts have continued to grow dramatically were up in the number of accounts from where we were previously which is a pretty big effort when you think about the growing industry that we have here we now bank of the top multistate operators were in states and were continuing to be very excited about the opportunities associated with the cannabis business frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 okay and then i dont know maybe if you can provide this on the tech the niche tech business or just the tech business in terms of i think tom you gave since the deal was announced and since the beginning of the year just wondering if you have after close how thats trended has it been pretty much stable with that yeartodate number or is it accelerated or any sort of color on just the second quarter there thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah sure its been stable to up since the close and to keep in mind the business is depositdriven it was really focused on israeli venture firms we have staffed and added people and broadened the ph encatchment of not just israeli venture firms so we expect to see that business to continue to grow frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay just so i understand when you said stable to up youre talking about in line with the growth rate you gave prior or youre just saying balances were in general were stable to up in the quarter thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp balances in general frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay got you okay great thats all i had thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks frank operator thank you and one moment for questions and our next question comes from matthew breese from stephens your line is now open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everybody ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp ph hey matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i want to go to the organic loan growth guide for the back half of the year the to could you just talk a little bit about the composition of the pipeline and the composition of that to expected growth yeah ill leave it there valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp sure okay hey matt its tom the first half we benefited from the strong residential consumer growth that was about of our organic growth we expect in the second half those levels to be negligible its just not going to its not going to grow okay on the commercial side our pipeline remained strong however were dealing with a rapidly changing interest ph rate environment as well as potential economic slowdown so thats likely to reduce our pull through in our workinprocess pipeline okay we do believe that we have solid growth opportunities across all our markets which weve seen in the first half of the year so that should support the loan growth guidance that we provided for the second half and i just want to point out in this growth we have never compromised our credit standards were still a very diverse granular production shop matthew breese q analyst stephens inc yeah along those lines i wanted to maybe get some color on how the underwriting has changed or how youve adapted to the current environment which seems like a little bit more tenuous and are you asking more of your borrowers in terms of additional equity or recourse or personal guarantees when it comes to originating loans curious there thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah its all the above and keep in mind that of our business is repeat business with longtime valued strong existing customers that have been through these cycles so theres a level of capability and credibility that they have built that being said we stress loans at a much higher interest rate which we began several months ago we stress highrisk industries on a regular basis and constantly look at the portfolio on the consumer side we changed our requirements on fico on loantovalue our average loantovalue on our real estaterelated loans is in the for the most part and we have always taken a much more conservative approach with regards to cap rates than others and if you look at the book of business it reflects that because it is very diversified by type by region and all our average production our average loan on real estate was million for this past quarter and ci was about million on average for each loan so we will well maintain those standards were looking at constantly adjusting fico scores on the consumer side and loantovalues on the commercial side matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then turning to the nim could you provide what the purchase accounting benefits were that flowed through the nim this quarter and the expectations on that over the next year michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 sure this is mike ill give you the recon because we anticipated that this question would be asked so in  that number was million that obviously excluded leumi in  it was million but of that million million of that was related to payoffs and so the run rate for  we would expect to be about million matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and a year from now what is that expected to be just so i have my kind of cadence of ph decline right michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp i think it would be about the same matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay i did want to address fee income a little bit i get the sense that swap fees could be a bit volatile curious overall if this kind of million run rate is a good one or do you think you can grow off that michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah i think we we believe that that is a fairly good goforward run rate you got to consider that swap fees are going to be impacted by the general interest rate environment and i think thatll probably get tougher as people look at the individual coverage of their own debt service but well see how that pans out toms comments earlier regarding resi mortgage is probably going to be challenged as well but whats exciting about the change here is the bank leumi brought in some opportunities for us to kind of counterweight or balance out some of those other items and so i think we feel right now that a mid to million per quarter is reasonable matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then last one when we announced or when you announced leumi its one of those things where we build on the cost saves but none on the revenue synergies once youre now that youre fully integrated could you just talk a little bit about those revenue synergies where are you most excited to grow the business thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah its matt again tom again matt sorry about that i forgot who i was for a second there i think just to remind you when we entered into the transaction we retained all of the customerfacing frontline people that also includes the credit people the administrative side anyone that touch the customer was retained as part of this so we have effectively seen a relatively seamless adjustment on the commercial side and thats evidenced by the commercial loan growth in the quarter so that is all operating positively we identified a small group of healthcare loans that we wanted to exit and leumi had begun that exit strategy during this transition those are the only customers that we have lost in any material way since we started this valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 i think the the balance sheet and they came into this with a pretty robust pipeline and the balance sheet that we now have together gives them the ability to retain customers that previously had to go to other banks because they were topped out at leumi and that should continue the tech piece is an exciting piece for us we gave you the numbers on that that grows were staffed there we have added staff in all of the markets chicago la and florida on the leumi side well continue to opportunistically add staff there the greatest opportunity continues to be not only on the vc tech piece but on the consumer piece theres been a regular flow of referrals from the valley to the leumi private bank side or from the leumi side to the valley consumer side that has been probably on a similar or larger scale than we had anticipated and that flow of business from leumi in israel for their international clients as well as for their participations in our real estate loans that we originate here that continues on the pace that we expected ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think matt some of the other stuff that weve looked at is really what leumi didnt offer to some of their customer base that really valley as a fullservice commercial bank is able to really do we have a very strong consumer set product as well that were able to offer to many of their customers so weve seen a lot of referrals on the residential side as well as the retail deposit side as well just having a branch network as well as having a strong international group there as well for us so we think theres boundless opportunities weve seen significant referrals across the organizations already and like you said while we didnt model in any of the revenue synergies were already beginning to see a lot of them matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great thats all i had thank you for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks matt operator thank you and one moment for questions and our next question comes from david bishop from hovde group your line is now open david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc yeah good morning gentlemen ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp hey david how are you david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 good good hey quick question in terms of the loan growth i may have missed this in the preamble but from a legacy basis just curious how the southern markets some of the newer markets fared this year and maybe the outlook for growth into the second half of the year and thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp sure on the its tom again david on the segments or the regions the production is north south thats been growing in the south the loan growth in the south is at an accelerated pace to the north its growing at around if you remember back in we began bringing in a team of people in all of the major markets in the south we brought in lenders mostly ci they produced about of our organic growth in this last six months and of what they produced in this past quarter was ci related so its were seeing faster growth in the south but very solid stable growth up north with this strong customer base that we have here david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc and is it safe to assume that those ci customers are also bringing in commercial deposits as well with these relationships thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp absolutely and thats we referred to that earlier that million growth in quartertoquarter and most of that 60plus percent being noninterest bearing and youve seen that in both north and south that growth in deposits david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc okay got it got it and then maybe just one final question now that the acquisition is behind you share buyback does that enter into the playbook as you enter into the second half ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think weve built such a wonderful organic engine here that any incremental capital we have we think we can put back into the business and give the shareholder a much better return david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc got it appreciate the color operator thank you and one moment for questions and our next question comes from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right good morning guys valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp hey jon how are you michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good i think the phone lines are down at jpmorgan that must be it feel bad for the guy you may have just answered this on dave bishops question but you talked about of growth from existing clients is that the story with the other thats the southern markets and the new hires or is there something else to call out there thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp no no its of our business are to people who have done business with us in the past would be of customer that is brand new to the bank that is spread out but its more its larger in the south jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it question on margin momentum and i dont need to pin you down on a number but just longerterm thinking and it kind of goes to deposit base comments how long does it take a hike a rate hike to fully cycle through your earning asset yields michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp i think one of the easier way to handle that jon is approximately of our loan book is tied to prime libor or sofr so that would be the stuff to reprice the quickest i dont know if thats a direct answer to your question but i think thats kind of where you start let me just also point out like the pace with which origination yields rose throughout the quarter so origination yields had increased to by the time we got to june they were closer to in february so if you think in that four or five months whatever it is origination yields went up basis points in that time fed funds have gone up basis points so that were able to pass through the borrowers relatively quickly and then again with the remaining of the loans tied to prime libor or sofr that component is very sensitive as well jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay that is helpful just with your deposit base strength it just feels like theres a lot of momentum coming in your margin so thats good ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think definitely jon just to follow up on that right obviously there is a lot of strength there but i think from an industry perspective not just valley right theres going to be a lag here and theres going to be deposit pressure valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 that really begins to hit many banks and thats going to happen whether its two more quarters from now or whether its sooner its definitely going to impact the overall industry which is why one of the things weve done in the last few years is really try to diversify the funding base that we have and not just have it from a retail or a brokerage business but have it in a multitude of different segments so we think while theres going to be pressure on the deposit side at some point based on where interest rates have gone we do believe that theres a multitude of different funding sources here thats going to be positive on that funding beta jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah i agree with that and most of your peers didnt have the kind of deposit growth you have so its clear on a relative basis i think you look better but just yeah ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp and then on just following up on that weve seen deposit growth just through july already more than outpace where we are on june loan growth so that trend that we showed for the second quarter has already continued through the month of july michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and our total funding beta for the second quarter was onethird of what weve modeled so we still have a long ways to go to make up just what were modeling jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then just one very big picture your credit numbers look good you clearly have some cautionary comments filtered throughout your answers on qa but theres a lot of crosscurrents and are you guys seeing anything that bothers you at this point from an economic point of view i know youre trying to be cautious but just curious if theres anything you would call out and flag that might be bothering you thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp none and were not experiencing any underlying areas of credit concern were not really seeing the stress or the weakness in the customer base and remembering weve got a long history with many of our customers that we do this business with but we are cautious we are underwriting differently stressing at a much higher cap rate than we had in the past and as we talked about before we do portfolio reviews on a constant basis and really focus on the highrisk industries in that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thank you guys i appreciate it nice job ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks jon thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2022 operator and thank you and i am showing no further questions i would now like to turn the call back over to ira robbins for closing remarks ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley
