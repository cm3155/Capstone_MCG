statements and the factors that could cause actual results to differ from those statements with that ill turn the call over to ira robbins ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you travis and welcome to those of you on the call this morning i will discuss ph valleys response to recent events and then we have time to provide insight on the quarters loan and deposit results mike will then discussed the financial results in more detail in the first quarter of valley reported net income of million earnings per share of and an annualized roa of exclusive of noncore items adjusted net income eps and roa were million and respectively this quarters financial performance was negatively impacted by seasonal factors related to net interest income and operating expenses net interest margin compression partially related to our conserve liquidity and other operating leverage headwinds that said i am extremely proud of the strength exhibited by our balance sheet in this recent period of stress to be clear we entered the turmoil from a position of balance sheet and capital strength our extremely diverse and granular deposit base contributed to our structurally low uninsured deposit balances and supported our funding stability during the quarter our business niches and geographic footprint have positioned as well to benefit from recent disruption in the last three weeks of march we opened over new deposit accounts which represented a full quarters worth of account acquisitions in normal times these accounts continue to fund a new customer flows remain strong from a capital perspective we continue to benefit from our modest securities portfolio and associated oci impact these characteristics as well as our strong underwriting track record have clearly differentiated value during this period of stress as always during the recent bank failure crisis our teams were proactive consistent and direct in their client communications this high touch approach further differentiates our organization and is indicative of the premier service oriented audio gap we are also set apart as one of the top risk managers in the entire banking space external stakeholders tend to focus on our track record of strong credit quality but we are equally proud of the other components of our enterprise risk culture for example our interest rate risk and liquidity risk management positively differentiated value during the crisis as a result of our strong risk management approach and confidence in our balance sheet we were able to bid on the former silicon valley bank we structure a sophisticated and thoughtful proposal that was strategically and financially compelling for valley while our disciplined bid came up just short in the end we are prepared and positioned to explore future opportunities that may emerge valley fills the void in the current banking landscape today as there are only a handful of commercial banks our size the entire country the niche of client we serve is strong and our opportunities will only expand exponentially as the banking industry further evolves over the last years our organization has successfully navigated a variety of diverse crises while we remain competent in our risk management approach strategic vision and collective path forward we are laser focused on diversity and granularity on both sides of the balance sheet and will not sacrifice the high credit standards which valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 has set us apart throughout our history we continue to provide industry leading service and expertise to assist our clients and communities in achieving their financial goals we believe that this longterm approach will drive shareholder value over time with that ill turn the call over to tom and mike to discuss the quarters growth and financial results thomas a iadanza president valley national bancorp thank you ira slide five illustrates our stable deposit balances for the quarter we are very pleased with the performance of our deposit base over the last few months precious experience following the closures of silicon valley and signature were generally contain to a few larger corporate relationships which we have been actively managing as rates increased our technology banking business performed extremely well during the crisis and experienced only a modest decline in total balances this team contributed to a significant amount of the new account openings that ira mentioned earlier the combination of runoff and lower cost customer balances and the continued utilization of higher cost fully fdic insured indirect deposits drove costs higher during the quarter in general ph data has remained in line with our projected path for the year slide highlights the diversity of our deposit portfolio roughly two thirds of our deposits come from our stable branch network just less than of our deposits are from specialized verticals like our online channel international and technology private banking and cannabis segments the diversity of available sources of funding continues to provide significant opportunity for valley to capitalize on disruption across the industry our uninsured deposit exposure compares favorably to peers and we continue to utilize a variety of tools to reduce this further most importantly our robust cash and available liquidity provides significant coverage in excess of our uninsured balances slide further illustrates diversity and granularity of our deposit base our commercial deposits are spread across our extensive geographic footprint and a variety of industries this diversity has been critical in defending our deposit base and should continue to provide discrete growth opportunities going forward you can also see some statistics on the depth and breadth of our client base we have over deposit customers with an average tenure beyond years our granular deposit base has an average account size of below turning to the loan portfolio on slide you can see an overview of the portfolios growth and composition while quarterly originations continue to decline net loan growth remains elevated as payoff activity is depressed our portfolio is extremely diverse across geographies and asset classes and both origination and portfolio yields continue to increase slide illustrates diversity of our commercial real estate portfolio by collateral type and geography as a reminder we have an extremely granular loan portfolio with an average loan size of roughly million from a metric perspective our weighted average loan to value is and our weighted average debt service coverage is approximately times we believe these metrics compare favorably to peers as we have consistently and conservatively underwritten to higher cap rates our experience with recent refinancing activity has been positive given the existing cushion we had baked into past underwriting valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 slide provides additional detail on a modest and granular office portfolio our office portfolio including healthcare office comprises a modest of commercial real estate this includes approximately ph million of owner occupied office our portfolio is geographically diverse with only immaterial exposure to manhattan the credit metrics on this portfolio are extremely strong and we have not experienced any losses in our recent history important the portfolio is largely multitenant with a very small average loan size of million we understand the concerns over office collateral in general but believe our portfolio is positioned to perform well we have utilized slide at various times in the past we believe this illustrates the ultimate manifestation of our strong and consistent credit culture in both ordinary times and in periods of stress valleys credit losses have been well below industry levels we anticipate this will continue going forward with that i will turn the call over to mike hagedorn to provide additional insight on the quarters financials michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you tom slide illustrates valleys recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends net interest income declined approximately million from the linked quarter we estimate that million of the reduction was related to the combined impact of the lower day count in the quarter and the drag of excess liquidity added in march the remaining pressure is the result of continued deposit mix shift into higher cost products and increasing deposit costs reflecting competitive dynamics our fully tax equivalent net interest margin declined basis points to from the fourth quarter of approximately basis points of the sequential reduction was associated with day count and the drag of excess liquidity in march remaining compression is largely the result of higher costs associated with incremental funding as you saw on slide cumulative deposit beta increased to in the quarter from in the fourth quarter while asset yields are expected to reprice higher the funding cost dynamic will likely result in net interest margin continuing to decline throughout the year absent the impacts of day count and excess liquidity we anticipate that our noninterest income growth will now be closer to to from the to range provided previously moving to slide we generated million of noninterest income for the quarter as compared to million in the fourth quarter this sequential growth was primarily the result of higher capital markets revenue and other income which offset seasonally lower income from wealth trust and insurance on slide you can see that our noninterest expenses were approximately million for the quarter or approximately million on an adjusted basis the increase in adjusted expenses from the fourth quarter were largely related to seasonally elevated payroll taxes expenses and the higher fdic assessment expenses in other categories were well controlled and declined modestly from the fourth quarter as a result of seasonal factors associated with day count and elevated payroll taxes our first quarter efficiency ratio traditionally represents the high watermark for the year were not currently revising our guided growth rate for noninterest expenses however our revised net interest income growth guidance will negatively impact our efficiency ratio expectations while efficiency will improve throughout the year we believe a full year estimate around is more reasonable turning to slide you can see our asset quality trends for the last five quarters the first quarters elevated net charge offs were the result of the further writedown of a ci loan discussed last quarter and a single development project these credits were each substantially reserved for and proactively addressed underlying credit metrics remained strong our allowance for credit losses declined to of loans from in the valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 fourth quarter the sequential decline was largely the result of substantial preexisting specific reserves associated with the quarters chargeoffs as a reminder our allowance coverage ratio of is still higher than our day one cecl ratio of as a percent of nonaccrual loans the allowance for loan losses increased to at march from at december in response to recent environmental turmoil we added disclosure around our securities portfolio on page in aggregate securities represent a modest of our total assets our portfolio is conservatively managed for ongoing liquidity and is not a profitability tool on slide you can see that tangible book value increased approximately for the quarter this was the result of our retained earnings and a modest improvement in the oci impact associated with our available for sale securities portfolio tangible common equity to tangible assets declined to during the quarter the sequential reduction is primarily a result of excess liquidity held at march if our cash position had remained stable on december our tangible common equity ratio would have been approximately our risk based capital ratios were relatively stable during the quarter as you can see given our modest securities portfolio oci would only have a minor impact on our regulatory ratios all else equal with that ill turn the call back to the operator to begin qa thank you question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will conduct the questionandanswer session operator instructions please stand by while we compile the qa roster our first question comes from steve moss with raymond james steve the floor is yours steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp hi steve steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe just starting off maybe just starting off with loan growth here you saw strong loan growth in the quarter just kind of curious as to how you think about the dynamics there and loan pricing as well thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah hey steve its tom iadanza as you saw we had a annualized growth i just want to point out how balanced diverse and granular was were still averaging below million in our cre portfolio originations and about million on our ci originations its balanced by region its balanced by type its balanced in a very valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 diverse way by size and such as ive mentioned we previously gave a range of to for the year we think well be at the high end or slightly above that range at the end of we have a very strong customer base very loyal customer base of our business comes from that customer base its relationship driven its priced in a relationship way we are opportunistically raising spreads wherever we can across the board steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and so in terms of raising spreads just kind of curious if youre raising spreads relative to whatever index how are you guys thinking about that it seems still pretty tight marginal funding costs around these days or just kind of any help you can give with that dynamic thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah sure keep in mind with the diversity of the types of loans we do this spreads will vary we have a very active profitability model which we use again its relationship driven the spreads will vary based on the risk and type of loan so its really hard to give you a figure on that spread but i will tell you on average spreads have probably gone up over basis points steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then maybe just one for me on credit you did have an increase in delinquencies here in ci and cre in the day day bucket kind of curious youd give some color around those projects and if how you guys are think about reserve ratio going forward thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah steve i think youre referring to the performing non accruals or performing accruals there that bucket slightly ticked up our nonaccruals went down to basis points from that performing accrual was slightly up but thats a function of one customer thats fully secured by cash surrender value of life insurance at about million you take that out that bucket also declined thats the process of getting indiscernible steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful i appreciate all the call here and ill step back thanks ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks steve operator please standby for our next caller our next call comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler frank the floor is yours ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 frank can you hear us frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co can you talk a little bit about the opportunity to fund that growth talk about you know where your brokered balances are now on the deposit side it seems like broker seems like a reasonable alternative in this environment for funding but are you limited in the room there in terms of bringing that higher or how do you think about funding in general here michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp maybe let me start just with i think how we think about funding overall and then i think tom obviously youll speak to some of obviously the demands from a loan growth perspective on what that is but yeah i think were probably incorrect to think every incremental dollar of funding cost comes in here at during the quarter we raised over million what i would deem is core funding nonspecific broker and the cost of that was a blended and we had a very strong funding vehicle across the entire organization based on the diversity and granularity that we have when you think about some of the incremental funding costs obviously a lot of thats attributable to the annualized loan growth that obviously impacts the data and as tom referenced we anticipate that lease declining a little bit which will definitely impact the plug that we need when it comes to some of the wholesale funding in the environment today thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp just to add to that frank as i mentioned of our new business comes from our existing customer base we have consistently supported them in all economic cycles at all times we will continue to do that we are experiencing a decline in our originations as youve seen on probably slide if i recall but more importantly our pipeline of approved to be closed loans is down since  so we are seeing that reduction in loan demand and as part of that our customers are choosing not to move forward on projects and reducing that pull through our work in process piece yeah and one other component when you look at the deposit side if you go back three years we didnt have the ditches and deposits or verticals that we have today so theres billion of deposits that came from some of those specialty programs that we referenced in that slide frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co right okay so in terms of the some of the verticals you mentioned the technology deposits which still i guess a relatively small piece of the overall pie i think tom you said they were down modestly but you also talked about opportunity on that side so are those and account openings so i wonder if you could just talk about the opportunities specifically with a couple of names that have the signatures of the world the silicon valley the opportunity there in the nearterm to drive both loan and deposit growth and then specifically on the technology side are those deposit balances now actually up from where they were or can you give a little bit more clarification there ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 hi frank and i think its something weve been focused on having a diverse ph granular deposit base that we have is something weve been commenting on and driving across the entire organization for the last fiveish years as tom mentioned that billion that were referencing on slide zero of that existed five years ago right the average cost of that is today so i think weve done a very good job of being able to originate alternate deposit growth based on different initiatives that weve initiated over the last few years which i think is now coming to fruition and i think one of the things that you dont see here though is some of the off balance sheet platforms that weve been able to create as well we had about billion billion move from our balance sheet into treasury accounts still on our platform since october 1st of last year now historically those would have been deposits that would have left the balance sheet at some point as the inverted curve begins to change theres obviously an expectation that those will rotate back into deposits on to the bank so we feel really good about the position weve been all the work weve done over the last five years in creating not just diversity from an onbalance sheet perspective but diversity from an offbalance sheet perspective those deposits that you see on slide billion there is still significant opportunity for continued growth in that and i think during the quarter we saw about growth in the cannabis business and we continue to see expansion of technology accounts across the entire platform the technology bucket is a little bit interesting theres obviously some chunkier deposits in there and some of those deposits ebb and flow based on unique activities within those individual clients one of the clients a very large percentage of that actually went public and as a result of that we lost some of those deposits during the quarter so it is a very very sticky deposit base over of the technology deposits are noninterestbearing here at valley which i think is different from a lot of other organizations as well so we are really excited about the continued opportunities for growth in these segments frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just lastly just point of clarification from the deck when you guys mentioned on the page slide the uninsured deposit number is that inclusive of the fully collateralized deposits are those in that uninsured number that michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yes theyre frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you operator our next question is coming from david bishop with hovde group david you have the floor david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc yeah good morning valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning david david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc good morning the earnings release notes that some of the short term funding that you guys added during the quarter has rolled off just curious how much has already been paid down or redeemed since the quarter end michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp this is mike as you can see from the earnings release at the peak im talking about from ph to at the peak during that time it was in excess of billion and as we sit today our cash and cash equivalents at the federal reserve or any other cash balance is at billion so it is remarkably come down and just to be clear about this this was done specifically for an abundance of caution given the environment that existed post march david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc got it and then in terms of the disclosures regarding the deposits curious did a lot of customers take advantage of sort of the indiscernible system just curious what you saw in terms of flows there michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so prior to march we had just a little over million in that program whether that be reciprocal or one ways the reciprocal balance as we sit today is billion and if you put the oneways in there its billion so there has been usage but i would say probably not as much as you would think once again it goes back to iras comments about the resiliency and the opportunities that we have in those various verticals to make that difference up thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp hey david its tom again just as a point of reference an example we were proactive in discussing a variety of verticals to ensure customer deposits and i will some of our very largest commercial deposit customers chose not to ph based on the confidence and faith in valley david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc got it and then one final question i think you noted in the preamble payoffs were down to zero this quarter just curious what they were this quarter versus the last thanks thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah i dont theyve been pretty consistent these last few quarters keeping in mind that the higher interest rates really knocked out any type of refinance business so they really havent deviated in the last two or three quarters valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc great thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks david operator our next question comes from manan gosalia of morgan stanley manan please go ahead with your question manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to follow up on the last question where you mentioned that cash balances are back down to billion or so based on that i guess how should we think about the nim trajectory embedded within your guidance so you noted that basis points of the decline in nim was related to day count and excess liquidity so is a good starting point for the second quarter about or so in nim and then how should we think about the decline in nim that you saw last quarter the core decline of about basis points should we expect that to slow as we go through the year michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp this is mike ill take the first stab at this first i want to point out that the billion that we have in excess liquidity on the balance sheet as we sit today i think the bias clearly for that will be for that to go lower as we see the crisis at least the immediate impact of the crisis abate in my prepared remarks as you rightly pointed out the basis points against the margin would put it at for the quarter but i think its important as you look forward march liquidity adjusted margin was only so were already starting to see some of that compression and essentially that compression is coming from two places one a continued rotation out of noninterest bearing into interestbearing accounts as tom alluded to and ira both our mix of clients tend to be savvy at very liquid customers and so they can take advantage of the fact that they dont need to hold as much in noninterest bearing and then the second reason is the inverted curve is causing increased deposit competition especially on the short end of the curve and also were competing against government securities with our clients as well some of the more savvy ones are moving into treasuries the good news on that side is theyre still staying within the valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 valley family to do that so in a different interest rate environment we expect some of those deposits or those securities to rotate back into deposits manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it as you think about the mix of nib nib deposit balances how should we think about that going into year end michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah right now we expect the trough i cant tell you what quarter i think its going to happen in but we expect the trough to be somewhere in the mid so we do expect continued rotation manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and maybe just a quick followup there in terms of the maturity of cds on your books i recall that you were putting on longer dated cds a while back how should we think about the maturities coming up over the next couple of quarters or so michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp no we have actually not been putting on at least in the last year longer dated cds weve been actually we put some specials on in that were roughly months at the high end and youll see all of that come due in the latter half of this year early manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it very helpful thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah thanks operator please stand by as we get our next question our next question comes from tim switzer with kbw tim you have the floor tim switzer q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you im on mike perito could you talk about your various deposit niches you have a very good pie in all of that and across the various industries and categories you have and which ones you think could be the strongest over the rest of the year and possibly as we enter into ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 thanks and i think obviously even there we mentioned a bunch of them and that diversity is really important to us so its not just specialized niches that are focused on one individual slide or on individual pie excuse me but its a lot of individual pie there that really comprise that as we think about the technology slide just in itself with a pie there obviously theres been a significant amount of disruption in the industry associate with that we opened up over accounts in the last three weeks of the first quarter another metric is we opened up business accounts in the fourth quarter indiscernible in the first quarter of and thats equal to what we would have done in six months back in so theres been a significant amount of activity across the entire footprint of valley and i think theres an opportunity to continue to expand some of the specialized ph beta when we were able to grow million of deposits in the first quarter at a blended rate of ph it does reflect the overall diversity i think the funding cost on an incremental blend basis will come down a little bit as we think about slowing loan growth so i think a deposit beta on a cumulative basis where we are today based on having loan growth at the levels we have really reflect a lot of organic deposit growth thats a little bit hard to see when we try to sort of measure it versus a lot of our peers that havent really generated the same type of loan growth that we have so we do believe that that beta will continue to perform and well probably improve on a relative basis as the loan growth really subsides a little bit tim switzer q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and on the loan growth my guess is ph now just given youre still kind of maintaining guidance there but have you heard from customers any signs of slowing investment or loan demand just out there with the uncertainty im wondering if people are starting to become a little bit more cautious what your discussions are like ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah as we mentioned earlier customers have certainly slowed down in their desire to start projects theyre going to wait to see what happens to the interest rate market over the next to months thats whats created that reduction in our to be closed bucket of our pipeline a lot of it is selfinduced by the customer base more so than it is by us customers were not seeing any deterioration in credit quality what we are seeing is just a wait and see by the customers tim switzer q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and has the environment caused you guys to tighten your lending standards at all ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i didnt get that question im sorry tim switzer q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc has the environment caused you to tighten your lending standards at all valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yes we have again we have a very conservative underwriting standards to begin with but we look to tighten especially in certain buckets of our portfolio so we consistently do that throughout every cycle tim switzer q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats all for me thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks tim operator our next question comes from matthew breese with stephens matthew go ahead with your question matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning everybody ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i know in past quarters weve discussed the outlook for deposit betas through cycle and in the past you provided somewhat of a range at this stage is it safe to say that the cumulative deposit beta will end up being closer to the higher end to is that kind of how you see this all playing out michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah this is mike we clearly think that through the cycle cumulative deposit beta will be around matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp well one of the things i think matt is obviously weve been in banking for a long time just like what youve seen you go back to sort of pass environment youve seen what happens but obviously betas in different environments are really a function of what the alternative external variables are as well and right now were in an inverted curve that inverter curve obviously ph going to pressure betas until the inversion changes so as mike mentioned travis mentioned and im sure a lot of others are seeing today most of our competition valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 today isnt peer banks that are sitting around the corner most of the competition sits in the treasury yields today based on where they are so that deposit beta is going to stay elevated i believe as long as were in this inverted curve but once we get back to sort of a normalized curve in a normalized environment i think the deposit betas will really come back down michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp this is mike again you can see that in our public disclosures the cost of deposits was around for the quarter but for the month of march it was and were originating new core deposits around so back to the comment that i think ira made earlier around dont think that every incremental dollar is being funded by something in the brokerage space which is closer to because we also have a promo rate right now on our internet at so the blended rate will come down but the beta is definitely going to go up as i said earlier due to the competition that were seeing in the marketplace for deposits especially post march matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and how have deposit flows gone post quarter end has the mix shift continued and our balances up or down ex brokered michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah the shift has actually been pretty good a couple of really good examples of that would be in our tech business as ira pointed out early on of our tech deposits were gone only half of those however were made up of one customer unrelated to the crisis and theyre only at reduction in march so we feel pretty good about where that is relative to the overall industry another bright spot would be that our branch deposits even when you consider the fact that people are making tax payments our branch deposits held in very well in a post march environment so the flows havent slowed the flows are still good we opened as an example i think ira mentioned this in his prepared remarks new accounts just in the month of march so the flows have been good but obviously we have growth in loans youre going to have a higher percentage of that being funded by broker just because of the sheer number or the average of those balance sheet increases matthew breese q analyst stephens inc have you seen any customers or hiring opportunities stemming from signature and dislocation at some of the other nearby banks thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp hey matt its tom were always going to be opportunistic to add teams of people as long as it follows our relationships driven strategy and our credit standards so the short answer to that is yes we do see opportunities matthew breese q analyst stephens inc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 okay and then last one for me just on new commercial real estate loans either those involved in a transaction or resetting into a new kind of five or sevenyear fixed rate what is the ultimate change in value particularly on commercial real estate office that youre seeing appraisals come in at particularly for loans that are precovid ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp sure we are seeing across the board increasing cap rates as you would expect more so in the office and retail industry than we have seen in multifamily and industrial were not major office players especially in manhattan we have million of manhattan office so were the nois are down so we would expect thats going to drive the values more so than the cap rates have increased to drive those values but we have not seen any material deterioration as a matter of fact we only have one office loan on nonaccrual thats travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp yeah i think one of the things to really look at matt is ph assuming what our day one underwriting was as an example multifamily for us the cap rates were right and when you look at sort of where the environment has been on that sort of reflects how we underwrote at day one so i think some of the change that others are seeing based on changes in interest rates and cap rates really are going to have less of an impact on us and i think maybe just going back to an earlier question that tim might have asked sort of what are our clients doing and were very fortunate to have a very strong knowledgeable client base that has been in the business for a very long time and theyre really the first line of defense here i was with a client the other day they actually walked away from a million deposit that they had on a project because they thought the economics just didnt work out now and there were other opportunities that were going to happen so our client base didnt just get into the real estate market three four or five years ago theyve been in for a very long time they are very astute and i think theres going to be a lot of ability for us to help support them as they continue to look at opportunities that are going to come about in this economic environment michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah and matt just a final point on this our average our weighted average loan to value on our real estate portfolio is on our office portfolio its so there is tremendous cushion in our previous underwriting standards as ira had mentioned matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great i appreciate it thats all i had thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks matt operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc rbc operator jon go ahead with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah good morning mike i was writing kind of fast can you go over the efficiency ratio guide again and what youre thinking on overall expense growth michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp sure so as a reminder if you were to go back to first quarter of you would also see an efficiency ratio that started with the to the left of the decimal place so for us to be at in the first quarter based on the seasonality of some of our expenses that being the largest portion of it being the various payroll taxes associated with compensationrelated expenses its not unusual and i also want to point out the second thing that is a large impact on the expense side which is the increase in fdic assessment rates that increased that basis point annual increase in rate that drove a million increase in our expenses as well so when you back those out as weve said in the past our longterm goal is to have a below efficiency ratio when you back those out and you consider the nim compression that weve talked about previously it seems reasonable to think that the bias right now might be slightly over for the remainder of jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so youre saying for the remainder of from here michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so what im saying is is seasonally high and i think that something over wouldnt be that terribly and were not talking about by the way were talking yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 okay and how about the fee piece of the equation any drivers or anything to call out in terms of your expectations there michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yes two things i think are really important one i hope it doesnt get lost in everything else thats going on our fee income was actually pretty good in the first quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp that was up over fourth quarter and when you look at the drivers of that the swap and the fx business the fx business came to us from leumi and were selling the valley legacy customer base into that those were strong and then the one negative thats in there that will come back is there is some seasonality to have dudley recognizes their revenue and we expect that to come back in the second quarter so i feel pretty good about fee income jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you for that and then ira you brought up ph a bit on svb and you talked about how youre open to opportunities that would have been a bigger deal but what might make sense for you guys and are you seeing any more or less in the way of opportunities to do something strategic ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp so i would say i think theres going to be a lot of opportunities available to us and i think ph valley as the function of the granularity and diversity that we have today within our balance sheet weve identified a couple of more strategic initiatives for the last three four years one of them was focused on diversity one of them was focused on continuing to build sort of specialized business lines across the organization to reduce some of the concentration increase to help expand some of the alternative funding sources as well as continuing to identify alternative noninterest income sources so i do believe theres going to be opportunities out there for us that said for us it really has to align from a strategic perspective and i think thats really critical we have a lot of internal and organic opportunities that i believe tremendous to us and it will be incremental for us to really go ahead and look at something else so i do think theres going to be other opportunities i think well be able to look at them but i think well be very disciplined sort of like we were on the ph svb bid that has to make both strategic sense for us as well as economic sense for us one of the things that ive been focused on for the last five years is making sure that our tangible book value grows and i think something im very very proud of when you think on a relative basis weve done much better than our peers in tangible book value growth over the last five years so thats something that sort of remains top of mind to me jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2023 yeah okay all right thank you appreciate it ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley
