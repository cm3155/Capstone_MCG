picture thoughts before i turn the call over to mike to discuss this quarters results in more detail in the fourth quarter of valley reported net income of million earnings per share of and return on average assets of exclusive of merger charges our eps and roa would have been and respectively these adjusted metrics include approximately per share of aftertax provision associated with the nonppp loans acquired from the westchester bank we generated net income of million and adjusted net income of million in adjusted net income was up nearly million or from these exceptional financial results reflect the execution of our strategic initiatives surrounding organic growth credit preservation and positive operating leverage we generated organic loan growth exclusive of ppp and acquisitions of over during the year growth was strong across our markets reflecting contributions from both legacy valley associates and new hires loan production was funded by low cost core deposits which continue to increase across geographies and business segments last quarter i spoke about our ongoing evolution to a leading regional bank while i wont rehash those comments i want to reiterate that todays banking landscape offers tremendous opportunity for serviceoriented bank like valley the recent acquisition of the westchester bank and the pending acquisition of bank leumi will enhance our competitive position and ability to capitalize on this opportunity these partners will bring us new business capabilities and access to geographies that will enhance our competitive position and support our growth targets by the end of valley will be well over billion in assets with a high quality core fund to balance sheet and strong capital position in todays banking landscape this is a very unique value proposition with that said the exceptional progress that we have made as a standalone entity should not be overlooked our adjusted roa of is nearly basis points above our level this improvement was not dependent upon reserve releases rather it is the result of net interest margin stability and consistent profitable organic growth as i think back on im proud of our ability to navigate covid uncertainty early on during the year we recognized a near million of net chargeoffs equating to just basis points of average loans this incredible result is a testament to our lending and credit culture im equally proud of our ability to quickly pivot to an offensive position which enabled us to generate significant organic loan growth and identify ideal merger partners during the year looking ahead i expect to be about execution execution on the integration of our acquisitions but perhaps as importantly on the organic growth opportunities that exist for us as relationshipfocused commercial bank we strive to be consistently in tune with our clients financial needs this has been a key driver of recent originations and will continue to support our organic growth going forward with significant ma and technology disruption around us there is an increasing pool of potential new clients which will provide an additional growth lever for valley we are excited by the team we have in place and are confident they have the right support and technology to capitalize on these opportunities with that ill now turn the call over to mike to discuss some of the quarters financial highlights michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you ira turning to slide you can see valleys recent net interest income and margin trends with and without the impacts of ppp during the quarter net interest income increased million or approximately valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 this was primarily the result of strong organic loan originations throughout the year million of net interest income from westchester and continued interest expense reductions on a reported basis net interest margin increased basis points to exclusive of ppp the margin increased basis points to our margin has performed very well throughout the year despite the overhang of excess cash weve actively driven down funding costs and are benefiting from strong organic loan growth throughout the year slide illustrates the ongoing improvement in our funding base over the last few years we have introduced new deposit niches and accelerated commercial deposit growth this has reduced our reliance on higher cost cds and borrowings this quarter cds and borrowings comprised of total funding versus a year ago meanwhile noninterestbearing deposits including those assumed from westchester increased from the third quarter and are up from a year ago during the quarter our cd and nonmaturity deposit cost declined basis points and basis points respectively our focus on low cost core deposit generation has led to a significant reduction in funding costs and positions us well for potential rising rates as the year progresses slide details our loan balances and the key drivers of our strong growth exclusive of over million of commercial loans acquired from westchester and adjusting for ppp runoff organic growth was over for the year on an annualized basis our organic growth was over during the fourth quarter with contributions across our geographies and asset classes on the bottom right you can see the diversity of our growth by segment while cre remains a key driver of our business ci growth was strong and consumer channels contributed as well ci growth was the result of new relationships and a modest uptick in utilization rates at december commercial line utilization was up from at september but still below the level at the end of as you know we have somewhat deemphasized the more transactional multifamily space which did not contribute to our growth during the year the combination of new hires throughout and the acquisition of westchester positions us for another year of strong organic growth in our welldiversified loan pipeline stands above billion which is in line with september levels we anticipate loan growth to be in the highsingle digits as you may expect commercial asset classes will contribute more than residential and consumer but growth should remain well diversified across our markets moving to slide we generated noninterest income of million for the quarter the million sequential decline reflected lower swap activity revenue from loan sale gains was stable as were our traditionally less volatile other noninterest lines trust and investment services income was strong in the quarter partially driven by the addition of dudley ventures in october deposit service charges also normalized throughout the year while we anticipate swaps income to rebound from the fourth quarter level the rate environment could weigh on mortgage banking revenues in on slide you can see that our adjusted expenses were over million for the quarter this number includes approximately million for the operations of westchester and dudley respectively we remain focused on generating positive operating leverage going forward over the last four years our revenue growth has outpaced expense growth by more than while we continue to explore incremental expense offsets to absorb ongoing investments future positive operating leverage is likely to be more dependent on revenue growth the acquisition of both westchester and leumi will enhance our capabilities and reach and contribute to strong revenue growth in and beyond turning to slide you can see our credit trends for the last five quarters our allowance for credit losses declined to of nonppp loans at december from at september despite realizing net recoveries during the quarter weve recognized a million provision primarily to account for our strong loan valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 growth we also recorded a million provision related to the nonpcd loans and unfunded commitments acquired from westchester it shouldnt be overlooked that our strong results were achieved without the benefit of a reserve release after a slight uptick in the third quarter our nonaccrual loan balances improved to basis points at december the improvement was primarily in the cre segment despite entering the year with uncertainty around the potential impacts of covid19 we are pleased with our credit performance and expect to preserve our strong track record in on slide you can see that tangible book value increased over for the quarter and over for the year we are extremely proud of this result in the context of our healthy dividend payout and the closing of the westchester and dudley acquisitions our commitment to producing consistent tangible book value growth guides our strategic decisionmaking process we remain very comfortable with all of our capital ratios and believe that our strong earnings performance will continue to support our organic growth efforts with our strong capital position loan pipeline and enhanced core funding base were optimistic heading into on page you will see that we are reinstituting select guidance for the year specifically we anticipate high singledigit organic loan growth of between and this should help to absorb a reduction in ppp income and drive midsingledigit net interest income growth for the year we expect to preserve an efficiency ratio below in with that ill turn the call back to ira for some closing remarks ira d robbins chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks mike i am extremely proud of our financial results it was extremely busy year for our organization and i am grateful for our teams hard work and commitment we are really excited about the opportunities ahead of us in and believe it will be another great year for valley with that id like to now turn the call back to the operator to begin qa thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from michael perito with kbw your line is open michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning michael michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning mike michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc mike sorry if i missed this admittedly due too much at once over here but the rate assumptions behind the nii guide do you mind just expanding on that a little bit for us michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp sure appreciate that question i know this has been a topic on many calls with many of our competitors as well our guidance in the model is reflective as of and it incorporates basis points of fed hikes occurring in may september and december and as a reminder we previously have disclosed this on our qs and ks a basis point shock increase would drive nii growth up on a static balance sheet and clearly we wont have a static balance sheet in with the loan growth that were guiding to but thatll help you get a better feel for what weve actually baked in to our assumptions in michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it so you have the three hikes in there i guess the question is you kind of point this out the balance sheet makeup i mean when you kind of look to budgeting i mean what type of cash carryover do you guys assume or if you cant get that specific just i mean are you guys assuming some normalization of the cash in being deployed or do you guys assume that it carries through conservatively for at least the first portion of the year here michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah we do have some modest reduction in the cash or cash in the early part of i think the thing that you should keep in mind is that more than likely the first place we would go if were in a much more robust economy and we saw some deposit attrition so the good news is we have that buffer to kind of first take the blow if in fact we have that which honestly given the deposit sources that weve built up over the year including the amount of valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 growth that we have seen in both business and checking accounts across the company in the last two years mostly related to the way we use ppp to add new customers i would expect that you would not see as much of a reduction at least in the early rate increases as you might otherwise think michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful mike thank you and then just a couple more on the expense side so exwestchester you guys were million give or take which was a little bit above the range you guys provided last quarter i mean it seems like theres generally some industrywide expense pressures upward curious if you could do you have a few moving pieces i know the efficiency guidance is excluding the pending acquisition but just curious if you could provide a little bit more nearterm commentary about how some of those expense pressures could come through and is it fair for us to assume that the million probably has some upward pressure here as we move forward michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah as you said mike everybody in the industry i think is observing some upward pressure on overall expenses not the least of which is related to wages and so were not immune from that as well but as we said in our prepared remarks and ill say it again were cognizant of those pressures they are the reality of the marketplace but we still feel comfortable that well be able to manage our efficiency at or below and probably more importantly its worth noting that we are willing to accept some disciplined expense growth especially if it leads to us being able to strategically capitalize on some of the investments that were making and they dont always line up right the expenses oftentimes can lead some of the revenue growth so well remain focused on that but i think the guiding principle that you should hear from us today is were comfortable with our overall efficiency ratio and in generating positive operating leverage michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc helpful got it and just lastly maybe a question for ira just obviously a couple of bank deals you guys launched valley pay growth in the cannabis sector you grew down south theres dudley ventures theres quite a bit that you guys kind of brought into the fold and just as we think at the onset of here you kind of touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks but would just love what you think kind of the two or three maybe more significant growth opportunities are from a tactical standpoint that you think we should be mindful of as we begin the year here ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you i think we really establish a wonderful foundation for us for theres been significant efforts over the last few years to really generate a strong foundation for organic growth and not just organic growth in the geographies that weve historically been in but organic growth capitalized and what were seeing down in the south as well as some of the national platforms that weve been able to build and i really believe thats going to take off in additionally i think the ability for us to execute and layer in the two acquisitions from a traditional bank perspective are going to be additive having more quicker than what we would have anticipated but on the periphery when you look at something like dudley ventures as well really the ability we have to incorporate that and provide a little bit of alternative fee income for us i think is going to provide benefits as well for so as i valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 said on my prepared remarks i couldnt be more excited about what weve built here moving forward and just really realizing what that looks like in should be exciting for all of us michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you guys for taking my questions appreciate it ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks mike operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning steven michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to first follow up on the expense commentary because if we look at the guidance or lower implies it could go up or down from here so im not sure exactly what youre saying what would be helpful can you give us a sense like expense growth with the inflationary pressure you cited is this a year is it a year can you give us a magnitude more from the expense growth side michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp well i wont put a number on it i will say this if you look at the fourth quarter numbers we generated revenue growth against operating expense of approximately and so as i answered michaels question earlier around positive operating leverage on a full year basis we are still committed to positive operating leverage and an efficiency ratio thats below those numbers albeit acknowledging that we do have noise in the numbers right through acquisitions closing in the fourth quarter combined with the impact of leumi which is much larger than those two previously closed or announced acquisitions steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp yes stephens its travis too i mean i would just say on the guidance side i mean we do give you kind of a range for nii growth rates thatll help kind of drive your revenue growth assumption and then you can i think utilize the efficiency guidance that we gave you to kind of get a range for expenses steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah well actually following up on the net interest income outlook the to is below the loan outlook and you have some rate benefit built in because you just said that so are you assuming deposits runoff is that why the nii outlook is below the loan outlook travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp no actually steven this is travis again just to be specific right we had million of ppp income in we have about million left of unearned fees in that category so theres going to be significant decline in ppp income and then we fill that bucket with a full year of westchester and the benefits of rising rates the benefits for our balance sheet growth the continued benefits of our interest expense saves so we do not have deposit runoff baked into the model steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc no deposit runoff do you think travis you can grow deposits next year travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp yeah steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then finally ira for you as you said is the year you focus on execution and youve obviously been active on the ma front does this mean you dont plan to look at or pursue ma transactions for ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah i will tell you i think we have an incredible ability across our entire organization to really do both as you saw in the i think slide when we talked about the benefits what we did from on the organic basis versus on the acquired so weve established a wonderful foundation here i think there is tremendous opportunity as i mentioned before about what bank leumi offers us as well as what the westchester bank offers us and well be remised if we didnt focus on executing that and really leveraging that from a growth perspective greater than what we had before that said i do think theres going to be tremendous opportunity when we think about whats happening with ma and not just from a technology perspective but also from a consolidation i dont want to distract anyone here internally but there may be something on the periphery that makes sense for us that really leverages what we think about from a strategic plan perspective but theres so much tremendous upside on just executing with the acquisitions weve done thats going to be the primary focus for us valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and actually i lied if i could squeeze one more the cannabis business how much growth did you guys have in the fourth quarter or where do those deposit balances end the year thanks ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp its well over in the hundreds of millions of dollars as to where the cannabis business is today i think the biggest opportunity there really is expanding some of the multistate operators i think were in states right now with an ability to go up to i think so we already have approved we have over of the current portfolio just in that pipeline as well so its an area of continued opportunity and growth for us we did begin to get tip of our toe into the lending business a bit at the end of the year and i think therell be opportunities for growth in that space as well and even with the valley pay i think as you mentioned its a closed loop payment platform that really enables us to look at growth from a multitude of different perspectives whether it be internally or even white labeling there is a lot of opportunity for us and if that agility that were trying to create throughout the entire organization for many of the initiatives that were putting forth and once again something were very excited about steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrific thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks steven operator thank you and im showing no further questions in the queue id like to turn the call back to ira robbins for closing remarks ira d robbins chairman president chief executive officer valley national bancorp i just want to thank
