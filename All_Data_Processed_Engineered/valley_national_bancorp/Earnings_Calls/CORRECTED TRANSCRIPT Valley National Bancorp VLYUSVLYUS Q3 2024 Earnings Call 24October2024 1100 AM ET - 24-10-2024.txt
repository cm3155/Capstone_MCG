quarter earnings conference call presenting on behalf of valley today are ceo ira robbins president tom iadanza and chief financial officer mike hagedorn before we begin i would like to make everyone

national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 with that ill turn the call over to ira robbins ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you travis during the third quarter of valley reported net income of approximately million and diluted earnings per share of this compared to net income and eps of million and a quarter ago the significant improvement in earnings was broadbased and primarily the result of top line revenue expansion and continued expense management our provision for loan losses declined during the quarter but exceeded our third quarter guidance primarily as a result of the significant growth in ci loans and unfunded ci commitments as well as a discrete reserve for the potential impacts of hurricane helene exclusive of these variables the third quarter provision would have been in line with our prior guidance im extremely pleased with the financial progress made during the quarter the continued improvement in our balance sheet metrics has been achieved in conjunction with a solid rebound in preprovision revenue tom and mike will detail the key contributing factors to this improvement but as we work through our financial plans we anticipate further profitability improvement reflecting an anticipated net interest income tailwind and the normalization of credit costs slide illustrates the significant progress that we continue to make towards our balance sheet goals our diligent management of new commercial real estate originations and renewals has contributed meaningfully to the percentagepoint yeartodate reduction in our stated cre concentration ratio at september this progress has been supplemented by organic capital growth and our recent preferred stock issuance throughout the year we have patiently monitored the market for a potential sale of cre loans to further accelerate our progress relative to cre concentration capital and funding flexibility im pleased to report that in the fourth quarter we expect to sell upwards of million of performing commercial real estate loans to a single investor at an extremely attractive discount the characteristics of the pool that we expect to sell are consistent with our broader portfolio in many ways the underwriting and credit metrics are very similar though these loans tend to be somewhat larger from an asset class perspective there is a tilt towards more industrial and less office as you may expect though the pool is geographically diverse consistent with our broader portfolio this transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and reflects the underlying credit strength of our portfolio and our continued ability to enhance our balance sheet in shareholderfriendly ways as i have previously stated commercial real estate is a terrific asset class and one that has provided excellent riskadjusted returns for our company while the transactional elements of our portfolio continue to wind down we remain focused on supporting the clients that have more holistic banking relationships with valley there are opportunities to further penetrate these banking relationships and expand this client base without applying undue pressure to our balance sheet while the transfer of loans to heldforsale helped to improve our periodend loantodeposit ratio we anticipate using a significant portion of loan sale proceeds to repay maturing brokered deposits in the fourth quarter of regulatory capital ratios are expected to benefit by basis points to basis points as a result of the sale all else equal and this transactions positions us to achieve our nearterm cet1 goal of approximately by the end of valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 the ongoing execution of our strategic initiatives positions us to exceed most of our previously announced intermediate term balance sheet goals sooner than anticipated to this end we now expect that our cre concentration ratio will be approximately by the end of as compared to our prior intermediate term goal of similarly and largely as a result of our recent and anticipated future ci growth we now expect that our allowance coverage ratio will be approximately by the end of relative to our current coverage level this implies a much slower pace of reserve build over the next five quarters and particularly throughout the course of slide highlights our expectations for the fourth quarter of we anticipate that continued growth in our ci and consumer portfolios will contribute to low singledigit annualized loan growth during the quarter as a result of the anticipated cre loan sale we expect net interest income will decline somewhat in the fourth quarter however exclusive of the sale net interest income will likely grow modestly as our recent experience in reducing customer deposit costs following the september fed action offset the impact of lower frontend rates on our floating rate loans our expectations for noninterest income and noninterest expense are generally unchanged from the prior quarters guidance from a credit perspective the general improvement in the commercial real estate backdrop has helped to isolate the few lingering issues that may result in credit losses our ongoing analysis of these situations and the potential impact of hurricanes helene and milton could result in higher net chargeoffs during the fourth quarter these factors combined with our continued ci growth expectations are likely to result in a yearend allowance coverage ratio of approximately with all of this in mind we expect to be well positioned for credit performance normalization in finally i want to offer our teams thoughts to the valley customers employees and communities that have been impacted by the recent hurricanes in our southeast markets unfortunately we have all been through many of these weather events and we know the toll that can take upon individuals and businesses valley is always there for those in need and we have proactively offered our support to the communities that have been in the path of these storms with that i would turn the call over to tom and mike to discuss the quarters financial highlights and results after mike concludes his remarks tom mike myself and mark saeger our chief credit officer will be available for your questions thomas a iadanza president valley national bancorp thank you ira slide illustrates the quarters deposit trends total deposits increased approximately million compared to the second quarter largely due to higher levels of direct customer deposits we are very pleased that a portion of this growth was the result of expansion in noninterest deposit balances during the quarter we added roughly new deposit accounts with nearly of these being on the noninterestbearing side while there was very little impact on the quarters results we have now reduced customer deposit costs by approximately basis points since the september fed rate cut this implies a total deposit beta which is somewhat better than our modeling importantly direct customer balances have continued to trend higher during october the next slide provides more detail on the composition of our deposit portfolio by delivery channel and business line growth trends in our international and technology segment and other commercial verticals were strong during the quarter valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 slide illustrates the components of the quarters lending activity we continue to execute on our strategic initiative to enhance ci and deemphasize multifamily and investor cre loans ci growth remained in the mid teens on an annualized basis for the second consecutive quarter and remains broadbased across our geographies and business lines on an organic basis multifamily and investor cre declined by million during the quarter as we experienced an uptick in prepayment activity as interest rates have fallen ira provided details on the additional transfer of over million of highquality cre loans to heldforsale during the quarter we are extremely pleased with the pricing on this transaction which will help to accelerate our strategic initiatives while new origination yields have declined in line with broader interest rates our portfolio yield continues to decline as a reminder of our loan portfolio floats based on shorterterm rate indices this makes us modestly assetsensitive from a structural perspective but incremental origination activity and the opportunity to outperform our deposit betas should offset some of this headwind slide provides additional detail on the composition of our commercial real estate portfolio by property type and geography as adjusted for the transfer of loans to heldforsale in the third quarter in general the commercial real estate markets and borrower performance across our footprint remain healthy ira previously mentioned that a few select loans will likely impact our net chargeoff experience in the fourth quarter these are identified and isolated situations and we are beginning to see the underpinnings of stability in terms of criticized and classified migration with that i will turn the call over to mike hagedorn to provide additional insight into the quarters financials michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you tom staying on the cre topic for a moment slide illustrates the contractual maturities of our commercial real estate portfolio weve included the ltv dscr and rate by maturity bucket for your benefit this maturity schedule continues to illustrate the minimal nearterm repricing risk that exists in our portfolio slide highlights the continued expansion in both net interest income and net interest margin during the third quarter interest income is now generally in line with the level a year ago as ira mentioned we expect to close on the sale of over million of commercial real estate loans during this quarter we anticipate that a significant portion of these proceeds will pay out maturing brokered deposits consequently we expect this sale to weigh on net interest income by approximately million during the fourth quarter all else equal to reiterate we were very quick to lower deposit costs across the franchise in the wake of the september fed action in total we reduced deposit costs by roughly basis points on our 40plus billion of customer deposits as customer deposits have continued to grow we remain confident in our ability to indiscernible additional fed rate cuts which may occur turning to the next slide you can see the detail on our noninterest income adjusted noninterest income for the quarter excludes both a 7million benefit for litigation settlement and a 6million negative marktomarket adjustment on the transfer of loans to heldforsale exclusive of these items adjusted noninterest income increased significantly as compared to the second quarter of this was primarily due to increases in tax credit advisory service charges on deposits and other income deposit service charges benefited from fees related to updated pricing on treasury services capabilities which started in midaugust and we expect additional tailwinds in this area on a goforward basis valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 on the following slide you can see that our noninterest expenses were approximately million for the quarter exclusive of the amortization of tax credit investments adjusted noninterest expenses were approximately million this represents a decrease from the second quarter of and general stability relative to the third quarter of expenses benefited from a decrease in technologyrelated and compensation costs our ability to control operating expenses without sacrificing necessary investment opportunities remains a hallmark of our organization we continue to model modest expense growth to support our aspirations but will work to offset these investments as we have done recently on slide you can see the continued and notable stability in our nonaccrual loans roughly of the sequential increase in pastdue loans was related to a pair of cre loans both loans are wellsecured and we anticipate nearterm resolution without loss of principal the next slide illustrates the trend in allowance coverage chargeoffs and provision our allowance coverage ratio increased basis points for the second consecutive quarter partially driven by substantial growth in ci loans and unfunded ci commitments as well as the allowance set aside for hurricane helene we expect that allowance coverage will expand towards in the fourth quarter primarily as a result of these same factors from a longerterm perspective we believe that credit costs will normalize meaningfully in and result in a much slower pace of reserve build the next slide illustrates the sequential increase in our tangible book value and capital ratios tangible book value benefited from a reduction in the oci impact associated with our availableforsale portfolio during the quarter our tier and total riskbased capital ratios increased as a result of our series c preferred stock issuance during the third quarter as ira mentioned the cre sale planned for november will likely add to an additional basis points to basis points to each riskbased capital ratio with that ill turn the call back to the operator to begin qa thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning guys ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc this all looks good but maybe mike or ira on the last comment you were talking about provision and reserves and maybe more normalizing in what does that really mean and look like is that a return to provision levels that are more like presecond quarter is that what youre signaling to us ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah i dont have second quarter in front of me so im not quite sure but i think we spent a lot of time during the course of the year looking at our portfolio and really assessing what type of credits we have in there today and as we really begin to see the environment normalize a little bit we feel really strong and confident about what those numbers begin to look like i think as weve guided towards what is going to look like i think we have some internal thoughts regarding what those net chargeoff numbers are going to be which are much lower than what youre seeing this quarter and then theres ph only an incremental build really needed to get to that ph million so much more in line i think with what you would have historically seen at valley which really creates optimism within the organization as we see the tailwind on the margin and tailwind regarding what the credits going to look like as well jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so the reserve building is going forward more about the mix of loans and not necessarily about any need to build for the existing portfolio is that fair ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp and ill let mark maybe address that a little bit but i think as we have emphasized the shift in building some ci loans within the organization which i will remind you was a multiyear sort of strategic initiative that we put forth a few years ago the growth has been tremendous which is a real positive so that should help us as we think about the recalibration of what the balance sheet looks like now that said they do come on at a higher reserve level than what these cre loans look like so as that mix shifts theres going to mandatorily be a requirement to increase the reserve purely of what that composition of loan looks like valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good fair enough indiscernible michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp ira is spot on oops sorry jon go ahead yeah no just reiterating what ira was mentioning there theres a substantial premium to ci from a loss perspective to cre and as we continue that shift successfully we will see a slight build along those lines but really just related to the indiscernible ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp jon are you still there jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah im all set guys thank you very much ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp okay thanks thanks jon operator thank you our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great i may have missed this but ira beyond the adjustments youre making to your targets for do you think this is all the adjustments that well likely see meaning the cre ratio reserve capital level anything else that might be on the horizon beyond this or just kind of where youre thinking is more appropriate with lower rates thanks ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think with everything we sort of understand now how were thinking about the balance sheet how were thinking about some of the strategic initiatives that were putting forth i think those intermediate targets are something that were very very comfortable with and we feel very confident that well be able to achieve them within the timeframe outlined christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect and then maybe overall i guess liquidity for assets i mean the mark is really really great execution it looks like any comment on how liquidity may have changed for or the markets appetite for assets given rates moving down thanks valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp yeah look i think weve seen chris this is travis so weve seen pretty consistent demand from the private equity side in terms of the cre assets that we have and weve had those discussions as the year has gone on i think earlier in the year given the backdrop at that point in time there was just a very wide gap between what we viewed to be the value of our portfolio versus the way a private equity investor may look at it and as time has gone on that gap has obviously narrowed to a point where i think a discount were all thrilled with the execution there and that would include nothing on the credit side as well its all ratedriven so i think there has been demand out there i think were happy to be able to execute something like this but its not just valley right youve seen other banking organizations execute not only loan sales but also arrangements going forward to help offload bank assets into the private equity markets and thats likely to continue christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks travis travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning its good to hear that the customer deposit costs are going down that 22basispoint reduction that you pointed out can you give us some more color on what youre baking in in your nii guide in terms of total deposit costs and especially going into as well because it seems like your allin deposit beta can be a little bit higher as you pay down those brokered deposits so any color on that nearterm trajectory would be great travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp so manan i think this is travis i think thats pretty insightful and we generally agree with you so we still bake into the model relative to nonmaturity deposits a beta on interestbearing and when you factor in noninterestbearing that goes down to we did outperform that with the first fed rate cut we think there are additional opportunities to outperform that going forward not only impacting the fourth quarter but into as well and so as we think about nii in our base case were still working through the plans but the base case would kind of be mid to high singledigit nii growth in and to the degree we can continue to outperform from a beta perspective you would move to the higher end of that range manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and on nib deposits those were roughly flat qonq you noted youve increased the number of accounts youve put on as well do you think youre at a trough there and anything youve noticed in the underlying data that would point to more acceleration going forward valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp so i think while they were stable there was a slight uptick in noninterestbearing deposits which was the first time weve seen that since the middle of so if you look at this years later or give or take i think its a very positive sign for us on an average basis nib was from a daily perspective a little bit higher i think than where it had been in the prior quarters and we continue to see that tailwind here quartertodate in october so i think theres optimism there we do anticipate the of total deposits will be the bottom of nib weve been there two quarters in a row and anticipate that itll continue to increase relative to the total manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and if i can just clarify the 22basispoints reduction in deposit costs since the fed rate cut those are total deposit costs including nib travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp yes thats correct so the actual data on the interestbearing side was higher manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from matthew breese with stephens your line is open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning indiscernible matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i appreciate your insights on deposit betas just stepping back a little bit you kind of defined the balance sheet as a tad assetsensitive and then we have an nii guide for early albeit in the mid to high singledigit range given were in a ratecutting environment could you just discuss a little bit the nim outlook and how that kind of fits with the assetsensitive balance sheet it feels like the nim should expand from here but just wanted to hear you clarify a little bit ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah i think thats generally right i mean we are structurally assetsensitive but that assumes the lower beta in the model and again our ability to outperform after the first cut and should that continue wed provide additional upside regardless of that i mean we do anticipate that the margin will continue to expand we are as weve said in the past generally neutral to the frontend of the curve more sensitive to the longer end and that fixed rate asset repricing opportunity will continue to exist as as we get into and move through the year valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 and on that front i mean the shape of the curve has definitely improved since we ran our preliminary numbers on september the and 10year points are basis points to basis points higher today than they would have been at that point in time which supports that as well similar to what i said on the beta side sustainability or improvement in those longerterm rates i think would definitely support us getting to the higher end of that range i laid out travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp and matt i just want to add i think one piece of when you look at an asset sensitivity balance sheet youre not looking at the rate of change as to what those assets are right so when you think about the longer end commercial real estate that we have even though those loans are actually repricing theyre not repricing down based on where they were originally struck at so those may be assetsensitive assets that are being shown but theyre going to reprice higher based on where those repricing rates are today versus where they were when those loans were originated so theres a lot of tailwind coming on those longer commercial real estate loans and other longerdated loans as well matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay the other one i had was just on the fee income guide for the fourth quarter it suggests kind of a flattish move from the third quarter and the reason it stands out its usually the fourth quarters strong for you given the tax advisory business so i was hoping you could talk a little bit about some of the moving parts and where you expect reductions in fee income to kind of get to the guide travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp i think youre going to get tailwinds on the tax credit side and also on deposit service charges i think it gets a little bit offset or mitigated by some of the other income stuff thats bucketed in a single line there can be lumpiness there relative to recoveries or other things that move around so its generally that and look i think longerterm theres absolute tailwinds behind us to grow fee income but i think there were some positive events that benefited the third quarter and just want to make sure that were appropriately conservative heading into the fourth michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and keep in mind that on the fee income side as weve said before the growth for the future is really going to be driven around our treasury management offering that weve talked about before and then also with our lower interest rates we would expect that gain on sale would pick up as the resi mortgage business increases as well matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay last one from me it just feels like youre pretty well set up for operating leverage here over the next to months when do you think you can get back above a roa on a sustainable basis travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp yeah i think when you normalize credit and look at where the margins go and i dont think its that long valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc ill leave it there thank you travis lan a executive vice president deputy chief financial officer valley national bancorp thanks matt operator thank you and our next question comes from ben gerlinger with citi your line is open benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good morning everyone ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc so on page i know these are kind of longerterm targets and youre not going to give me a detailed or finite answer which is fine but when you say loantodeposit ratio below in by the end of i mean when you just kind of think hypothetical like or or whatever down the road are we talking closer to like or or just what would be like the optimal range i get that youre not going to press the gas to get there but like where would you want this to be three years from now ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah look i think the low probably makes sense on where we think well end up being threeish years or so from now it doesnt have to be a linear path as to how we get there either but we have a lot of initiatives internally as to how we think about deposit growth across the organization weve been pleased with the new account generation that weve seen here at valley and we anticipate continued strong deposit growth that will help get us to those numbers that weve identified but i think sort of where youre describing in the low probably makes sense a few years out benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats helpful and then when you think about just the behavioral response from clients it seems like across the industry with limited loan growth its pretty easy to price indiscernible i mean the first basis points is probably the easiest ph hundred or trimming aspect but when you kind of pivot have people pushed back on anything have you seen mix shift or any kind of frustration from the clients or is it just kind of willingly taking the compression given that were not we dont have a huge amount of demand for loans so you dont really necessarily need to keep every indiscernible deposit valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp its funny i think the people that are more sensitive to deposits are the analysts and our internal bankers as to what they think the client reactions going to end up being i think we were very aggressive as to how we thought about deposit repricing that said weve seen deposits increase even though weve been reducing balances thats on what you would define as direct deposit accounts from a digital perspective as well as sort of longer term relationships so across the board weve seen real pricing ability here so we are definitely optimistic about what the future of that looks like and once again deposits balances were up even though we were aggressive in reducing rates benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats helpful thank you ill step back ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you ben operator thank you our next question comes from jared shaw with barclays your line is open jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp hi jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc maybe first on the loan sales do you have the yield on the blended yield on that portfolio ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah it was slightly above jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay and then when i look at the gain on sale or the gainloss on sale of loans whats the difference between the loss you called out on this portfolio and whats in the income statement were there other loans sold as well and what should we expect for like sort of the pace of loan sales going forward beyond this ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 yeah so that line in the income statement also includes our traditional gain on resi mortgage sale that was about million this indiscernible was up somewhat from the prior quarter jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay and then in terms of the ability to or the desire to sell more of these cres in like a in a pool like that whats the appetite for additional sales ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp look i think weve been pretty consistent on this front that we didnt feel like we had a gun to our head from a cre perspective or any other action that weve taken this year so we were patient and methodical and allowed it to play out and we reached a point where i think the discount was extremely attractive for us and all it does is help accelerate kind of the strategic progress weve been discussing on the balance sheet side so i dont anticipate that there would be more cre sales candidly but we always monitor the environment for all of these opportunities and are willing to do whats best for the shareholders at given point in time jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay great thanks and then just finally from me on the expenses youve had good success as the broader expense base has been able to come down is there anything that when we look at technology and equipment expense anything thats sort of unique there or at what point do you need to start i guess maybe reinvesting in technology or where we could see that number start to increase ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah i think were always reinvesting in technology and other areas as to what our future looks like we went through a pretty significant core transformation about a year ago and as we mentioned at that time sometimes it does take a while to sort of bleed through what some of those expenses are going to look like its not just the immediate expense say with a thirdparty vendor but what your internal processes look like and how you indiscernible how you service a client so theres always opportunities to reassess what that looks like i think if you go back and look at where third quarter expenses were a year ago i think were almost flat really on an operating basis and when you add in the fact that fdic insurance is up million if you then layer in the fact that we have a crt trade that we didnt have before that added a few million dollars as well and indiscernible on an operating basis contracted million in core operating expenses just in a year and we continue to believe that we have opportunity to further improve the efficiency within this organization jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks very much ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 operator thank you our next question comes from anthony elian with jpmorgan your line is open anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning on slide you called out specialized deposits at about billion which i think shows about billion growth sequentially i think most of those segments showed growth versus the prior quarter can you just talk about whats driving the recent growth specifically in the technology bucket ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah technology i mean we continue to have a good pipeline of companies that we bank on that side and progress there can be relatively lumpy but there have been significant growth opportunities that we capitalized on this quarter other commercial deposits is kind of the traditional banking that you would anticipate our online account despite the fact that weve cut the rate there a handful of times and now have a ph rate out there continue to see growth in balances so i think its pretty diverse and broadbased but as weve said weve said now for years so these are the lines that are going to provide aboveaverage deposit growth for us as we look forward so you have the quarter like this where you see each of those contributors continue to grow and i think thats generally in line with what weve been talking about anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you and then my followup youre guiding to low singledigits annualized loan growth in but you call out the midteens growth you saw in ci this quarter i guess once you get down to your cre concentration of ph and loan growth for the industry returns more broadly what do you think is a more normalized level of loan growth for the company as a whole thank you thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp anthony its tom i think when you look forward itll be in that midsingledigit level well continue to manage the cre concentrations through and weve experienced this ci growth for really the fiveplus years in that low to middoubledigit level and our pipelines tell us that that should continue into the fourth quarter and into the next year but somewhat offset by what were going to do with our cre concentration anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from steve moss with raymond james your line is open steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc hi good morning indiscernible valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc on the ci portfolio here you guys have experienced two good quarters of growth just curious kind of where youre seeing the drivers of growth and if theres any component thats either participationdriven or ph international credit thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp oh no i mean our ph ci portfolio is very small less than of our total and were aging on 30plus percent of that so were not getting that through buying participations in any way i just want to remind everyone and ira said it earlier we have experienced this level of growth for fiveplus years in that low doubledigit level and that goes back to when we started bringing in teams emphasizing the florida markets and bringing in teams of ci lenders in florida and opportunistically bringing in people in the northeast and we still do so a lot of this is coming from that middle market business banking local regional its steady growth there accelerated in florida versus what were seeing in the northeast and then the specialties many of which we have had for years and some of that have come through acquisitions have added growth on top of that but its that continued sales process relationshipdriven middlemarket type business steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great and then just also noticed kind of i know you guys have been building reserves broadly but the ci bucket has always had a higher reserve its up basis points yearoveryear to ph as a reserve as a percentage of loans just curious kind of what are the drivers for that portfolio in terms of higher reserves michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so within the ci portfolio really at the end of the day that portfolio as can be expected has a slightly higher loss ph given default than our cre portfolio thats really the primary differentiator between the end reserve rates on that portfolio as weve migrated throughout this past year in a higher interest rate environment there has been some stress on portfolio so on the ci portfolio as the cre portfolio there was some migration which contributes to that increase as well as criticized assets carry a higher reserve than pass rated steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and to that point on criticized and classified i think i heard the comment that the increase has moderated just kind of curious is that kind of like cre stabilizing here and maybe the driver in the criticized is ci or just kind of the dynamics there that you guys are seeing michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so we absolutely believe that the interest rate environment has shown some easing and we anticipate that the migration that weve seen over the past year in criticized classified assets should definitely abate with likelihood at some point in potentially towards the end of the year versus the beginning that we should see some positive migration in the portfolio valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great thank you very much ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from matthew breese with stephens your line is open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey just a quick followup we discussed on the call expectations for kind of elevated chargeoffs in the fourth quarter could you just give us some sense for how lumpy that can be what are we talking here michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so as it relates to potential chargeoffs we have a isolated group of loans that weve been tracking that we have our eyes on for potential losses not definite there is that we expect that there is a chance that that level could be elevated from what weve seen but materially not a level for the year which is out of line with anything that weve seen at a quarter level as a percent of portfolio
