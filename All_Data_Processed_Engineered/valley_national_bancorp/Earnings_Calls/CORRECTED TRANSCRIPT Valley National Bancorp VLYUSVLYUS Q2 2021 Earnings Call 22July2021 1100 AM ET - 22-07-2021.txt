those of you listening into the call this morning i want to discuss our recently announced acquisition of the westchester bank as well as our targeted efforts to capitalize on disruption opportunities in our markets mike will then provide additional details on the financial results before opening the call to your questions in the second quarter of we reported net income of million earnings per share of and return on average assets of for the fourth consecutive quarter this represents the highest level of quarterly earnings in valleys entire history on an adjusted basis return on average assets was reflecting strong net interest margin performance improved fee income and a stable provision for loan losses looking forward we expect that additional balance sheet growth and core margin stability will continue to drive strong financial performance and shareholder value over time a few weeks ago we announced the acquisition of the westchester bank we are thrilled with the opportunity to partner with this highperforming commercial bank and look forward to having president and ceo john tolomer lead our combined efforts in the westchester market this is a dynamic area with significant household wealth and commercial lending opportunities westchester also contributes a strong core funding base and physical delivery presence in this attractive market from a financial perspective we believe the transaction is very wellstructured we expect annual earnings accretion and no impact to our pro forma tangible book value or capital ratios westchester will be nicely additive to the million of loans that valley already has in westchester county johns team will benefit from valleys comprehensive product set and robust balance sheet resources as a result of this combination we expect that westchester county and the surrounding market will be a source of meaningful growth for valley in the future while we are excited about this transaction it will not disrupt our organic growth initiatives or prevent us from considering other strategic opportunities to that end i thought it would be helpful to reiterate our ma priorities and relevant financial thresholds we remain interested in potential transactions that would accelerate our strategic initiatives around sustainable balance sheet growth enhanced efficiency and improved revenue diversity from a financial perspective we are focused on tangible book value preservation to the degree that an opportunity is strategically compelling we will be willing to accept a modest tangible book value dilution as long as the earnback period is short we are seeing some recent transactions with earnback periods beyond three years which is likely outside of our comfort zone at valley we have strong organic growth initiatives underway and while we have the currency to be competitive we will not sacrifice in the financial guardrails that we have established we believe that this discipline is in the best interest of our shareholders and potential partners over the long term historically valleys balance sheet growth has been wellbalanced between acquisitive and organic efforts this balance is likely to continue over time and we are extremely excited about the organic growth opportunities currently available to us during the quarter we originated a record billion of new loans this was billion higher than the first quarter and resulted in annualized growth in nonppp loans the value of our diverse valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 business lines and balance sheet remains apparent as this growth was spread across commercial residential and consumer categories we continue to see meaningful opportunities in both our northeast and southeast geographies our recent hiring efforts and proven ability to attract and service new clients positions us well to continue to capitalize on disruption across our entire footprint we also have a really exciting and unique story playing out in the funding side of our balance sheet over the last few years we have focused on diversifying and enhancing our core funding base on a combined basis our cannabis banking buildout digital account opening upgrade and ability to crosssell deposit accounts to new ppp customers have generated nearly billion of new deposits in the last six to nine months we recognize that all banks have benefit to a certain degree from surge deposits and excess liquidity in the banking system but these valleyspecific initiatives and others in the pipeline represent sustainable and scalable futurefunding sources that reflect our ability to identify and execute on customer acquisition opportunities capitalizing on the loan and deposit opportunities ahead of us will depend on continued investment in talent technology and new business capabilities over the last few years these investments have been largely funded by expense savings in other areas that lowhanging fruit has largely been captured and future investments may result in some incremental expense growth over the next few quarters as with everything that we do we will be thoughtful on the investments we make and work hard to find additional offsets in the legacy expense base we remain laser focused on generating positive operating leverage over time and any investment will be aimed at driving stronger revenue growth and long term financial performance we are extremely excited about this quarters performance and the opportunities that remain available to us our growth and performance during the quarter reflect a tremendous team and infrastructure that we continue to develop the future is extremely bright for valley and we look forward to continued success alongside our new partners at the westchester bank with that id like to now turn the call over to mike hagedorn for some additional financial highlights michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you ira turning to slide you can see that valleys reported net interest margin increased to from in the first quarter of exclusive of the impact of ppp loans we estimate that net interest margin would have been versus in the prior quarter this improvement reflects meaningful funding cost reductions partially offset by the drag associated with carrying a higher cash balance much of the quarters loan growth occurred in june and will more meaningfully impact third quarter results we continue to actively manage the funding side of the balance sheet and drove another basis point reduction in our interestbearing liability costs during the quarter interestbearing deposit costs continue to decline due to a significant reduction in time deposit costs and balances we also benefited from continued growth in noninterest bearing deposits during the quarter we issued million of subordinated debt at a cost of we also redeemed million of legacy subordinated debt at a cost of and prepaid nearly million of fhlb advances at an effective average cost of in the aggregate these redemptions will almost entirely absorb the annual interest expense of the new subordinated debt valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 despite significant loan origination activity and our efforts to reduce borrowings and wholesale funding our cash balances continue to increase during the quarter putting modest downward pressure on our margin we will remain vigilant and look for opportunities to put cash to work but recognize that we are likely to continue to hold more liquidity than in the past you can see more detail regarding the impact of ppp income on slide we estimate that ppp contributed basis points to the margin versus basis points in the first quarter as of june we had forgiven billion of ppp loans representing over of our round one and two originations we expect that the pace of forgiveness will slow somewhat in the third quarter and beyond slide outlines our interest rate positioning and the remaining opportunity to reprice liabilities over the next four quarters of note we have billion of borrowings at a cost of set to mature in the third quarter while we have capitalized on the majority of the funding improvement opportunities in our cd and broker deposit portfolios we continue to grind our nonmaturity deposit costs lower as a result of active balance sheet management and significant deposit growth our net interest margin has been extremely resilient over the last few years despite the challenging interest rate backdrop we expect to preserve a net interest margin in the range of at least to give or take for the remainder of the year excluding the impacts of ppp slide illustrates the ongoing improvement in our funding profile total deposits increased another during the quarter fueled by a increase in noninterestbearing balances and a increase in other transaction balances continuing our recent experience cd balances declined in the quarter noninterest and interest bearing transaction accounts now comprise and of total deposits respectively these dynamics contributed to the sequential basis point reduction in deposit costs in the second quarter as ira mentioned our recent growth in low cost core deposits is partially attributable to our unique funding niches specifically in the cannabis and digital areas we have also had success crossselling deposit products to commercial customers including those newly acquired through ppp as these efforts continue to accelerate we will monitor opportunities to further enhance the efficiency of our physical delivery channels slide details our loan balances and origination trends over the last few quarters the strong lending pipeline that we described last quarter resulted in billion of loan originations during the second quarter this represents a billion sequential increase in origination activity or a increase from the first quarter as ira mentioned this growth was wellbalanced between our consumer and commercial categories and across geographies roughly onethird of the growth was in residential and consumer with the remaining twothirds split relatively evenly between northeast and southeast commercial categories we continue to prove our ability to attract and service customers across our geographies we did not sacrifice underwriting from a credit perspective as both commercial and residential originations remain in line with our history from an ltv and fico perspective on a yeartodate basis we have achieved annualized nonppp loan growth we believe we are positioned to achieve the higher end of the midsingledigit range that we guided to coming into the year moving to slide we generated noninterest income of million for the quarter up nearly sequentially the increase was broadbased reflecting a rebound in residential mortgage gain on sale income and higher income from both swaps and insurance commissions fee income increased to of total revenue during the quarter up from in the first quarter we continue to explore diverse fee opportunities that would contribute to greater revenue diversity and noninterest income consistency on slide you can see that our adjusted expenses increased by approximately to million roughly twothirds of the sequential increase was for higher cash incentive compensation accruals as we have valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 consistently stated we are focused on driving sustainable positive operating leverage during the quarter our adjusted revenue growth outpaced adjusted expense growth by more than times this drove our adjusted efficiency ratio down to from in the first quarter while we are proud of the efficiency gains that we have achieved over the last few years we are not satisfied as ira mentioned ongoing disruption in our markets continues to create unique growth opportunities for our organization our efforts to capitalize on these opportunities may lead us to selectively invest in additional revenuegenerating talent technology and business capabilities these thoughtful efforts may result in somewhat higher expenses in the near term but should support meaningfully higher revenue over time which will result in further positive operating leverage turning to slide you can see our credit trends for the last five quarters our allowance for credit losses declined to of nonppp loans from in the first quarter this was the result of significant loan growth that we achieved during the quarter from a cecl model perspective due to the improved economic outlook in our markets we replaced the weight on moodys prolonged slump scenario with a weight on the upside scenario we will continue to review these weightings on a quarterly basis our nonaccrual loan balances ticked up to basis points from basis points in the prior quarter this increase was largely driven by a single construction loan we have allocated a specific allowance of million to this relationship early stage accruing past due loans also ticked up during the quarter but remained below levels during the quarter our active covidrelated deferrals declined to million or just of total loans versus in the first quarter additional detail on our deferrals can be found in the appendix as we have reiterated throughout the crisis valleys historical credit strength remains a distinguishing characteristic of our organization as a result we are confident in our existing reserve and expect to outperform the industry on credit loss experience in any economic environment slide illustrates the consistent growth in our tangible book value and the continued improvement in our capital ratios tangible book value has increased in the last months driven by our strong earnings performance our tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio increased to from in the first quarter adjusting for a billion of ppp loans tangible common equity would have been above as of june our total capital ratio also increased significantly during the quarter as a result of our very successful subordinated debt issuance we continue to believe that our earnings power will provide the capital necessary to support our organic growth initiatives with that ill turn the call back over to ira for some closing commentary ira d robbins president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks mike we are extremely proud of the strong growth and financial performance achieved this quarter our net interest margin has been extremely resilient reflecting our active balance sheet management and loan and deposit tailwinds we continue to identify unique opportunities for growth and remain focused on driving positive operating leverage valleys future is extremely bright and we are committed to remaining a highperforming institution for the benefit of all of our stakeholders with that id like to now turn the call back over to the operator to begin qa thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions please stand by while we compile the qa roster and our first question coming from the line of frank schiraldi from piper sandler your line is open frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning frank michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just wondered if you could talk a little bit about the recent lending hires particularly down in florida are those teams still ramping up and did you add any one in the quarter thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp hey frank its tom iadanza yeah we continue to add where we think were going to get revenue enhancement we added in total in florida over the last ill say six to nine months eight in new york new jersey weve onboarded three during this second quarter we have offers out for a few more we are starting to experience the benefits of their pipeline build and their pullforward into loans deposits and relationships for the bank but as you know it usually takes six to nine months to build the pipeline to start onboarding but were starting to see the benefits of that already frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay great thanks and then ira you mentioned laser focused on positive operating leverage you also mentioned the higher expenses due to investments in the near term just wondering maybe if you could it sounded to me like maybe the efficiency ratio could tick up then in the near term and just wondered if you could maybe give your thoughts there or any ph governors around that over the next couple of quarters ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp yeah thanks thanks frank i think when we look at our adjusted efficiency ratio obviously the current number is impacted because of ppp as well but we have as you mentioned done a lot over the last few years to try to rightsize the organization based on an appropriate foundation to really grow we think weve as we said during our earlier comments really gone to a point where maybe theres a bit more focus within the organization on valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 revenue enhancement and putting the appropriate infrastructure in place to really leverage that to a greater degree mike are you going to give a bit more commentary michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah frank this is mike the revenue lags as you all know sometimes the people investments and as tom said weve made some of those and in our prepared remarks you heard some comments around some other hires as well theyre not just in the revenueproducing part of the business so what i would say at this point is our past run rate the last several quarters was around million i think our adjusted expenses this quarter of million are more indicative of what the goforward run rate will be ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp just to put in some kind of context frank when you think about growth within the organization its not just on the revenue side but some of the new hires that tom referenced earlier but its also on the technology side and how we think about the indiscernible of investment on the technology what the benefit from an automation perspective is going to look like down the road on average we spend about of our technology dollars on running the bank compared to about according to gartner where most banks are so there is a lot of investment we have internally going in to improve and transform valley from a customer experience perspective as well as we think from a overall on the efficiency side so the dollars that were spending are both on the revenue side and on the operating side on the expense side to really prove out future operating efficiencies frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay i just want to make sure i understand though now im not so sure in terms of the efficiency ratio is it the messaging is then that it might kind of hover around here in the near term or couldve ticked up in the near term any color on that ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp when you back out ppp its going to tick up right so lets just do the math right there youre going to have an uptick just overall based on that there will be some additional investments that are going to come that we think will provide some positive operating leverage as we continue to move forward and the revenues are going to follow that and that being said as tom referenced we hired people on the revenue side about six to nine months ago we should begin to see some benefit from them starting in the next quarter as well and thatll mitigate some of the additional expenses that were describing frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co got you okay thank you operator our next question coming from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is open valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp hey steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc just to start on the loan side i know you guys said last quarter the loan pipeline was strong heading into this quarter but the billion was a really great result can you talk about the competitive landscape that you saw as you were booking those originations and do you think you can sustain that level of originations here thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp sure hey steven its tom iadanza our pipeline on the commercial side remains strong were about billion with half of that being loans that weve approved in stages of documentation to close that level that billion level is in line with what we reported at march so that piece of the pipeline despite active closings especially in june of this year is building and that segment of closing is at the same levels as we have in the last quarter we are seeing a slowdown on the consumer side especially in auto and on some of the refinance activity on the resi side the expectations slightly over annualized for the first six months we think that number will hold up in the second half of the year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and what about the competitive environment tom can you comment on that particularly im curious northeast versus southeast thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp sure sure as you know there is some disruption from other acquisitions merger activity in both markets were benefiting from that through the attraction of people as well as customers we are actively onboarding those customers we assisted with ppp were building loan pipeline and loan portfolio and deposit from that we have what we instituted years back was a very focused customer solicitation program identifying what a core customer is for valleys identifying programs and processes to onboard them crossselling them and then rewarding our people based on that performance thats not new that weve been doing that that has reaped benefits for us and create a consistency the northeast has been very steady growth for us though were getting faster growth in the southeast the competitive landscape is active its fair its not just banks but we are getting our fair share steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and ira following up i think you called that billion of deposits tied from various initiatives which included the cannabis business could you give us an update on cannabis and maybe what portion of those deposits are in that business now valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp so at this point its about a third of those deposits are coming from the cannabis sector yeah i think weve been very focused on that steve making sure that we have the right risk appetite day one we spent about months devising our internal approach as to how we want to go about it to make sure it was consistent with the risk appetite at valley we have targeted the large multistate operators as we think they provide the appropriate risk for us as we look at who we want to partner with here and theres really opportunity there we are banking tier customers in new jersey pennsylvania ohio florida and illinois at this point steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then finally ira just following up on your prepared comments where you ran through ma priorities which i dont recall you doing before are you signaling that youre maybe more actively pursuing additional ma here and weve seen quite a few larger deals from your peers how are you thinking about a larger deal here thanks ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp yeah look i probably maybe a bit more formal today as to some of the financial guardrails but definitely internally and in other conversations this is sort of i think the guardrails that were pretty comfortable with i think probably today were maybe a bit more focused on targets that could accelerate some of the revenue growth or revenue diversification versus straightup expense opportunities that may have shifted a little bit from where we were maybe a couple of quarters or even a few years ago we do think theres a significant amount of disruption in the marketplace today and as a result of that theres real opportunity for us to look at leveraging revenue growth within our footprint as well as individual asset classes and were really excited about that that said some of the deals that ive seen where you have three years of tangible book value earnback just seem excessive to me steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay what about you guys pursuing a larger deal here ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp larger than the bank of westchester probably steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc well yeah well even moe right i mean some of the deals that youve seen have been moelike ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp i think the moe has to really make sense i am really excited as is our team about the organic initiatives we have here i think a lot of them are really beginning to come to fruition and if we are to do an moe or something of significant size it has to make real strategic sense for us from the revenue extension perspective and if it doesnt were very comfortable just going down the path that were going we think were generating at this point valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 well above peer returns and we think we have a path to continue that and really accelerate it so by no means that we feel any kind of pressure by any means that we need to start looking at an moe because theres technology gaps that we have because theres market gaps that we have because theres talent gaps that we have quite the contrary i think our organic opportunities are probably much better than what our peers are and theres absolutely zero pressure on our end to do anything of an moe based on being backed into a corner indiscernible steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thats really helpful color thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks steve operator and our next question coming from the line of michael perito with kbw your line is open michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp hey michael michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i want to just start clarifying mike just i want to make sure i heard you right on the nim so youre saying that the core or adjusted nim will be between and for the balance of the year here and then ppp will be either on top of that or detriment to that depending on the pace of forgiveness michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so it will be on top of that so thats the core lets just use the second quarter numbers was the reported result exppp its and as a reminder the billion we had in excess cash you know roughly weighed on nim another basis points so as we think about nim compression going forward ppp forgiveness both volume and absolute impact trailing off as we get more and more of those balances off the balance sheet we think that the core nim stability that were shooting for is between and i would say that the most recent quarter coming up bias would be towards the higher end of that michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right i was just going to say i mean if the growth is where you guys are suggesting it should be that that would make sense and then on the fee side i believe you guys had close to if not your highest quarter youve had on kind of the trust and investment side and then biggest quarter youve had on the insurance commission side in valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 year and a half maybe just curious if you guys can comment on some of the trends there and maybe what we should be expecting near term on fee growth thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yes hey michael its tom iadanza on the insurance side a lot of that is coming through our title company hence an improvement in our general insurance agency that we operate the title business will continue to grow maybe not at the same pace relative to the growth in the refinance in the residential market for us as well as they do a lot of commercial business so we expect that to be steady may not grow at the same pace its grown in the last quarter and i think overall our fees on the wealth trust and insurance business should be flat to slightly up michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc helpful and then just last question from me we saw a couple of articles that had linked you guys to the condo that collapsed down in south florida so just curious if you guys could comment on whether there was any lending or depository relationship there and maybe just give us a refresher on kind of how you underwrite those types of relationships in that marketplace that would be great thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah sure there are we had no loans outstanding on that property the general portfolio that we have on the hoas relative to our size is small its about million of outstandings the waterfront highrise is million of outstandings and less than million in commitments our portfolio is primarily inland around golf community singlefamily and townhouse from a depository the portfolio generates million in deposits and as i said before million or slightly less than in loans our average loan in that portfolio is michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc really helpful tom thanks and obviously not a huge number in terms of the underwriting process of those types of buildings is there some type of like property condition assessment thats a part of your process there i apologize its probably pretty simplistic question but any additional color would be helpful thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp no absolutely and another reference is following hurricane andrew back in the the requirements for building and safety in the buildings was enhanced and the bulk of our loans if not most of our loans were done where buildings that were done after those product improvements and process improvements from an underwriting standpoint we have an inhouse engineer that reviews all of the advances on any of the construction or improvement parts of the loan that we may have and we have third parties who will also review michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc very helpful so i guess at this point safe to say that you guys feel while small in relative size still feel pretty decent about that portfolio and the properties that are within it valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yes and again keep in mind its primarily townhouse and singlefamily homes inland and its a deposit business primarily for us we lead with deposits in that business michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thank you for spending on that and i appreciate it and thanks for answering my other questions operator our next question coming from the line of steven duong with rbc capital your line is open steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning guys ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning steve steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc ira just your westchester bank acquisition and i assume youve been in discussions different markets can you share with us your florida market indiscernible versus your metro new york market how are they different in terms of maybe activity and opportunities travis lan a senior vice president headinvestor relations valley national bancorp yeah steven this is travis lan just though id step in and try to respond and then ira can clean up what i miss but the issue with us look wed love to do an acquisition in florida i think but that market theres not as many targets and the targets that exist are highly valued i would say and make the economics a little bit more challenging and i think thats why you saw us go out on the more of a hiring push earlier this year because we identified the fact it was unlikely that we would do an acquisition for it in the nearterm so organic growth opportunities were more significant and thats where we focus our efforts theres more opportunities up in the northeast but we look kind of that you can tell with westchester across the size spectrum as ira said were focused on strategic opportunities to grow revenues and westchester is a very highperforming bank despite its size and you can look at the earnings accretion and say is immaterial but what that doesnt capture is the opportunity for us to provide them products they dont have today and to accelerate their growth with our capital and balance sheet resources so i think thats part of why it was so compelling ira ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp i have nothing else to say there travis thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 travis lan a senior vice president headinvestor relations valley national bancorp all right cool steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thanks travis and then just moving on to the loan growth i mean really great quarter all around a lot of the growth came from your cre portfolio can you just give us some color on was that primarily in florida and any specific type of cre thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp sure it was wellbalanced across the regions florida represented about of our productions and of our growth more importantly was distributed evenly in product types between apartment industrial some retail to a central type of properties average loan size was in line with our previous performance million was the average loan size weighted average loan to value was and debt service average was over times very equally balanced between new york new jersey florida and alabama steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats great to hear tom i guess you mentioned that the yeartodate in the beginning it looks like you feel comfortable that you may be in that range for the second half of the year do you expect a similar performance with cre as well thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp i would expect cre will be the still the larger generator the ci business were a little hamstrung in that through our line utilization companies are not borrowing if anything theyre paying down our average utilization went from to quartertoquarter so were still producing ci business slight uptick but its a little bit harder of a road steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc understood i appreciate the color and congrats on the good quarter ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thank you thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp the only other thing to add is that we also continue to exit nonrelationship lowyielding business and we had about million of that repaid in the second quarter and million yeartodate primarily assets obtained through the oritani purchase at new york city multifamily type so well continue to do that and still experience the growth that were suggesting valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc understood thank you operator and our next question coming from the line of matthew breese with stephens inc your line is open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning matt michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc id like to drill down into expenses a bit more so mike you mentioned that the million of operating expenses is more indicative of where were going but i get the sense from iras commentary that the million is really a starting point where we could see some growth so my question is what do you expect to add on top of the million what is your anticipated growth from here or am i do i got my read wrong michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp i dont think you have the read wrong as you look now im talking about a multiyear lookout im not talking about next quarter so in a multiyear lookout especially some of the technology investments not so much the software and the related depreciation but the people that were bringing onboard to accomplish the technology buildout over time are going to drive expenses higher over time its inevitable but i want to point you back to what ira and i both said to the prior question around it those investments are being made while you mean i get that onetoone relationship when you actually see the financial benefit of it those investments are being made so that we can be a more efficient entity in the future we can service customers differently and faster we can release some of the redundancies in our processes and streamline our workflows those benefits show up after those technology projects are put in place and i want to be clear about this im talking about a multiyear kind of view forward thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp maybe matt maybe id just ask that this is not a first niagara by any means as to how you think about when we think about expenses here when three or four years ago when we first started talking about some of the initiatives we were going to do from a strategic perspective we talked about an incremental million of technology spend as you can see we were able to really layer in that million and we still dropped the valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 efficiency ratio across the entire organization every single dollar we spend here has to be justified has to make sure that theres an appropriate return on it were not doing it were not just spending money on technology for what we think is going to be revenue enhancements but what we think will be franchisebuilding opportunities and theyre going to be in line and appropriate with the appropriate revenue growth and earnings per share growth that we have its not going to outpace it matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay travis lan a senior vice president headinvestor relations valley national bancorp and this is travis matt just from a modeling perspective right so we were million of adjusted expenses this quarter but that included million of what i would call higher or abnormally high kind of cash incentive accruals so when you take that out you kind of add some a little bit of in the expense growth that were talking about it gets you to that million and thats kind of whats what were contemplating at this point which is why i think mike said that million run rate was a good one matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay next question from me could you talk a little bit about the loan portfolios exposure to floating rates how much is there and then how much is subject or below floors where if we do get a fed hike were not going to see the benefit michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so this is mike ill take a stab at it and im sure tom will join on the end within the entire loan book roughly of our loans billion are addressable and of that billion billion or so are tied to libor or prime and they reprice on a regular basis so your point is i think what youre getting at is do we have the ability to have repricing take place on that i think we do there are biases towards that but its a balanced portfolio matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay i did want to talk a little bit about valley direct the digital bank can you give us a sense for the use case here the capabilities and the reason i ask is obviously the world is increasingly using mobile devices and all things digital but during the upinterest rate cycle my gut was that the digital bank offerings from regional bank peers tended to be strictly depositgathering and came with higher deposit betas so perhaps you could give us just a quick pitch on valley directs aim and how it would be different and ultimately valueenhancing thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah i think we just reported on this in the first quarter the valley direct is really opportunity to revamp our online account opening process we dont need it today for a deposit gathering were not really using it for that benefit were using it primarily to improve the process create efficiencies roll out this account opening process online in each of our branches developing those efficiencies there we have seen traffic slow in the branches we valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22jul2021 have seen our online and mobile utilization increase and respectively from last year and well continue to use that valley direct as an efficiency for onboarding new accounts into our system matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp but to really just add up on that point it is not as youre describing something were just looking at from a deposit perspective it has an opportunity from a platform perspective to be how we think about opening across sme accounts across a multispectrum of different structures whether it be on the deposit side or on the loan side we had the ability to really build a lot of this inhouse which was important to us that gives us the flexibility to make sure that the customer experience is something that we own not what a third party owns and i think thats part of the focus as we move forward we need to own our customer experiences we need to own our employee experiences and a lot that is driving what the technology initiatives are across the organization but if you were to go on to valley direct today you would find an experience i think many would really enjoy three minutes plus or minus to open up an account and onboard it as well here which is something that we think is leading and will helpfully drive multitude of efficiencies across the entire organization matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay last one for me is on the allowance you mentioned in the release that there are increases in the allowance across most of your loan categories including commercial real estate up basis points due to higher quantitative reserves could you just flesh it out a little bit more what happened there and are you preparing for any sort of increase or change in the level of chargeoffs michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so within the model the most sensitive attribute would be the loss rates and those did not materially change so the biggest change from a dollar perspective was the fact that we had significant loan growth when you combine that with an improving economic scenario that i talked about in my prepared remarks from moodys you get a slightly lower required allowance and thats why you see the minor basis point tick down in our allowance coverage ratio matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great thats all i had thank you for taking my questions michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings
