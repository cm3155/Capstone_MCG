interchange fee equal to no more than  plus basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions the federal reserve also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraudrelated requirements required by the federal reserve the federal reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product because we exceed billion in assets we are subject to the interchange fee cap on october the federal reserve released a notice of proposed rule making that would lower the maximum interchange fee that a large debit card issuer can receive on a debit card transaction under the proposal initially the base component would decrease from  to  the ad valorem component would decrease from basis points to basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction and the fraudprevention adjustment would increase from  to  for debit card transactions performed from the effective date of the final rule to june in addition the proposal would adopt an approach for future adjustments to the interchange fee cap which would occur every other year based on issuer cost data gathered from large debit card issuers we will continue to monitor the status of
