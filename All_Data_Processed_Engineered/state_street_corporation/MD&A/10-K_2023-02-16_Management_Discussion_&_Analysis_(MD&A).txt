collectively as back office services and middle office services the nature and mix of services provided and the asset classes for which the services are performed affect our servicing fees the basis for fees will differ across regions and clients changes in market valuations our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our auca increases or

pricing we estimate using relevant information as of december that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations on a weighted average basis over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues on average and over multiple quarters of approximately we estimate similarly assuming all other factors remain constant and using relevant information as of december that changes in worldwide fixed income markets which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide

impact was on average with a range of to annually gross investment servicing mandates were trillion in and trillion per year on average over the past five years over the five years ended december gross annual investment servicing mandates ranged from approximately trillion to trillion servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided the time required to install the assets and the types of assets installed revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed our installation timeline in general can range from to months with the average installation timeline being approximately to months over the past years our more complex installations including new state street alpha mandates will generally be on the longer end of that range with respect to the current asset mandates of approximately trillion that are yet to be installed as of december we expect the conversion will occur over the coming months pricing the industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today consequently no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins as the amount of revenue associated with auca once installed can vary materially we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately in both and on average over the five years ended december this impact state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations was approximately annually with the impact ranging from to in any given year pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us such as extending the term of our relationship with the client expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide the timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services and the amount of revenue generated may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services the nature of those services and client investment practices and other factors these same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients in order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds we estimate that we need at least trillion of new auca per year although notwithstanding increases in auca servicing fees remain subject to several factors including changes in market valuations client activity and asset flows the manner in which we price our services the nature of the assets being serviced and the type of services and the other factors described in this form 10k historically and based on an indicative sample of revenue we estimate that approximately on average of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of auca another on average of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve and the remaining approximately of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values based on the impact of the above client activity and asset flows net new business and pricing noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients the full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur particularly in periods of higher volatility table start table

the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period new asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals new asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted but

compliance and esg investment tools revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided the timing of installation and the types of assets as previously

which we report based on monthend valuations management fees for certain components of managed assets such as etfs mutual funds and ucits are affected by daily average valuations of aum management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided and the associated management fees earned are dependent on equity and fixedincome security valuations additional factors such as the relative mix of assets managed may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of aum and the investment strategies employed management fees may reflect other factors including performance fee arrangements as well as our relationship pricing for clients from the second half of through the first quarter of we were in a prolonged lowinterest rate environment and waived certain fees for our clients for money market products following the federal reserve rate hikes in march and september money market fee waivers did not have a significant impact on our management fee revenue in the last three quarters of assetbased management fees for passively managed products to which our aum is currently primarily weighted are generally charged at a lower fee on aum than for actively managed products actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable accounts performance in light of the above we estimate using relevant information as of december and assuming that all other factors remain constant including the impact of business won and lost and client flows that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations on a weighted average basis over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues on average and over

foreign exchange trading services revenue comprises revenue generated by fx trading and revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services which made up and respectively of foreign exchange

and trading represent fx transactions at negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly these principal marketmaking activities include transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers as well as those funds under custody with us indirect fx trading represents fx transactions with clients for which we are the funds custodian or their investment managers routed to our fx desk through our assetservicing operation we execute indirect fx trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients our fx trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors including the volume and type of client fx transactions and related spreads currency volatility reflecting market conditions and our management of exchange rate interest rate and other market risks associated with our fx activities the relative impact of these factors on our total fx trading revenues often differs from period to period for example assuming all other factors remain constant increases or decreases in volumes or bidoffer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases as the case may be in clientrelated fx revenue our clients

transactions which we enter into as principal which we refer to as our enhanced custody business securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to noncash collateral is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our share of the fee split as principal our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower either our client or a brokerdealer we act as principal when the lending client is unable to or elects not to transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities in our role as principal we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating while we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower market influences may continue to

environment including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards interpretations of those standards and our own balance sheet management activities may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency lending or enhanced custody businesses the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods software and processing fees

as asset and liability management consisting primarily of interest rate risk model risk strategic risk and reputational fiduciary and business conduct risk many of these risks as well as certain factors underlying each of them could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements and are discussed in detail under risk factors in this form 10k the identification assessment monitoring mitigation and reporting of risks are essential to our financial performance and successful management of our businesses accordingly the scope of our business requires that we consider these risks as part of a comprehensive and wellintegrated risk management function these risks if not effectively managed can result in losses to us as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation our approach to risk management including board and senior management oversight and a system of policies procedures limits risk measurement and monitoring and internal controls allows for an assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balances risk and return our objective is to optimize our returns while operating at a prudent level of risk in support of this objective we have instituted a risk appetite framework that aligns our business strategy and financial objectives with the level of risk that we are willing to incur state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we manage risk with a focus on the following objectives a culture of risk awareness that extends across all of our business activities the identification classification and quantification of our material risks the establishment of our risk appetite and associated limits and policies and our compliance with these limits the establishment of a risk management structure at the top of the house that enables the control and coordination of risktaking across the business lines the implementation of stress testing practices and a dynamic riskassessment capability additional information with respect to our stresstesting process and practices is provided under capital in this managements discussion and analysis a direct link between risk and strategicdecision making processes and incentive compensation practices and the overall flexibility to adapt to the everchanging business and market conditions our risk appetite framework outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define the level and type of risk we are willing to undertake in the course of executing our business strategy and also serves as a guide in setting risk limits across our business units it further defines responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits and for reporting escalating approving and addressing exceptions our risk appetite framework is established by erm a corporate risk oversight group in conjunction with the mrac and the rc of the board the board formally reviews and approves our risk appetite statement annually or more frequently in response to shifts in endogenous or exogenous risk conditions governance and structure our approach to risk management involves all levels of management from the board and its committees including its examining and audit committee ea committee the rc the human resources committee hrc and the tops to each business unit and employee we allocate responsibility for risk oversight so that riskreturn decisions are made at an appropriate level and are subject to robust and effective review and challenge risk management is the responsibility of each employee and is implemented through three lines of defense the business units which own and manage the risks inherent in their business are considered the first line of defense erm and other support functions such as compliance finance and vendor management provide the second line of defense and corporate audit is the third line of defense reports to the ea committee of the board and is independent from the business units erm and other corporate functions corporate audit provides independent assurance to the board over the design and operating effectiveness of key internal controls included within the risk management framework the responsibilities for effective review and challenge reside with senior managers management oversight committees corporate audit and ultimately the board and its committees corporatelevel risk committees provide focused oversight and establish corporate standards and policies for specific risks including credit sovereign exposure market liquidity operational information technology as well as new business products regulatory compliance and ethics vendor risk and model risks these committees have been delegated the responsibility to develop recommendations and remediation strategies to address issues that affect or have the potential to affect us we maintain a risk governance committee structure which serves as the formal governance mechanism through which we seek to undertake the consistent identification management and mitigation of various risks facing us in connection with our business activities this governance structure is enhanced and integrated through multidisciplinary involvement particularly through erm the following chart presents this structure while our

management committee oversees the enterprisewide data management strategy provides independent oversight of the programs associated with enterprisewide data management serves as an escalation point for material and emerging enterprisewide data management issues and determines oversees enterprisewide data management priorities and strategy credit risk management core policies and principles we define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty borrower or obligor collectively referred to as a counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with contractual terms we assume credit risk in our traditional nontrading lending activities such as overdrafts loans and contingent commitments in our investment securities portfolio where recourse to a counterparty exists and in our direct and indirect trading activities such as securities purchased under a resale agreement principal securities lending and foreign exchange and indemnified agency securities lending we also assume credit risk in our treasury and securities and other settlement operations in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances with central banks or private sector institutions and fee receivables we distinguish between three major types of credit risk state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations default risk the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its contractual payment obligations country risk the risk that we may suffer a loss in any given country due to any of the following reasons deterioration of economic conditions political and social upheaval nationalization and appropriation of assets government repudiation of indebtedness exchange controls and disruptive currency depreciation or devaluation and settlement risk the risk that the settlement or clearance of transactions will fail which arises whenever the exchange of cash securities or other assets is not simultaneous the acceptance of credit risk by us is governed by corporate policies and guidelines which include standardized procedures applied across the entire organization these policies and guidelines include specific requirements related to each counterpartys risk profile the markets served counterparty industry and country concentrations and regulatory compliance these policies and procedures also implement a number of core principles which include the following we measure and consolidate credit risks attributed to each counterparty or group of counterparties in accordance with a oneobligor principle that aggregates risks across our business units erm reviews and approves all material extensions of credit and material changes to such extensions of credit such as changes in term collateral structure or covenants in accordance with assigned creditapproval authorities creditapproval authorities are assigned to individuals according to their qualifications experience and training and these authorities are periodically reviewed our largest exposures require approval by the credit committee a subcommittee of the cmrc with respect to small and lowrisk extensions of credit to certain types of counterparties approval authority may be granted to individuals outside of erm we seek to avoid or limit undue concentrations of risk counterparty or groups of counterparties industry country and productspecific concentrations of risk are subject to frequent review and approval in accordance with our risk policies and appetite we evaluate the creditworthiness of counterparties through a detailed risk assessment including the use of internal riskrating methodologies we review all extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of counterparties at least annually the nature and extent of these reviews are determined by the size nature and term of the extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of the counterparty and we subject all corporate policies and guidelines to annual review as an integral part of our periodic assessment of our risk appetite our corporate policies and guidelines require that all extensions of credit are consistent with the banks standards limit creditrelated losses and our goal of maintaining a strong financial condition structure and organization the credit and global markets risk group within erm is responsible for the assessment approval and monitoring of credit risk across our business the group is managed centrally has dedicated teams in a number of locations worldwide and is responsible for related policies and procedures and for our internal creditrating systems and methodologies in addition the group in conjunction with the business units establishes measurements and limits to control the amount of credit risk accepted across its various business activities both at the portfolio level and for each individual counterparty or group of counterparties to individual sectors and also to counterparties by product and country of risk these measurements and limits are reviewed periodically but at least annually in conjunction with other groups in erm the credit and global markets risk group is jointly responsible for the design implementation and oversight of our credit risk measurement and management systems including data and assessment systems quantification systems and the reporting framework various key committees within our company are responsible for the oversight of credit risk and associated credit risk policies systems and models all creditrelated activities are governed by our risk appetite framework and our credit risk guidelines which define our general philosophy with respect to credit risk and the manner in which we control manage and monitor such risks the previously described cmrc refer to risk committees has primary responsibility for the oversight review and approval of the credit risk guidelines and policies credit risk guidelines and state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations policies are reviewed periodically but at least annually the credit committee a subcommittee of the cmrc has responsibility for assigning credit authority and approving the largest and higherrisk extensions of credit to individual counterparties or groups of counterparties cmrc provides periodic updates to mrac and the boards rc credit ratings we perform initial and ongoing reviews to exercise due diligence on the creditworthiness of our counterparties when conducting any business with them or approving any credit limits this due diligence process generally includes the assignment of an internal credit rating which is determined by the use of internally developed and validated methodologies scorecards and a 15grade rating scale this riskrating process incorporates the use of riskrating tools in conjunction with management judgment qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a replicable manner and following a formal review and approval process an internal credit rating based on our rating scale is assigned we generally rate our counterparties individually although some counterparties defined by us as lowrisk are rated on a pooled basis credit ratings are reviewed and approved by the credit and global markets risk group or its delegates we evaluate and rate the credit risk of our counterparties on an ongoing basis to facilitate comparability across the portfolio counterparties within a given sector are rated using a riskrating tool developed for that sector our riskrating methodologies are approved for use by the portfolio risk committee a subcommittee of the cmrc after completion of internal model validation processes and are subject to an annual review including revalidation risk parameter estimates our internal riskrating system promotes a clear and consistent approach to determining appropriate credit risk classifications for our credit counterparties and exposures this allows us to track the changes in risk associated with these counterparties and exposures over time this capability enhances our ability to calculate both risk exposures and capital and enables better strategic decision making across the organization more specifically our internal risk rating system is used for the following purposes the assessment of the creditworthiness of new counterparties and in conjunction with our risk appetite statement the development of appropriate credit limits for our products and services including loans foreign exchange securities finance placements and repurchase agreements the automation of limit approvals for certain lowrisk counterparties as defined in our credit risk guidelines and based on the counterpartys probabilityofdefault the development of approval authority matrices based on pd riskier counterparties with higher pds require higher levels of approval for a comparable pd and limit size compared to less risky counterparties with lower pds the analysis of risk concentration trends using historical pd and exposureatdefault ead data the determination of the level of management review of shortduration advances depending on pd riskier counterparties with higher rating class values generally trigger higher levels of management escalation for comparable shortduration advances compared to less risky counterparties with lower ratingclass values the monitoring of credit facility utilization levels using ead values and the identification of instances where counterparties have exceeded limits the aggregation and comparison of counterparty exposures with risk appetite levels to determine if businesses are maintaining appropriate risk levels and the determination of our regulatory capital requirements for the airb set forth in the basel framework credit risk mitigation we seek to limit our credit exposure and reduce any potential credit losses through the use of various types of credit risk mitigation the basel iii final rule permits us to reflect the application of credit risk mitigation when it meets the standards outlined therein examples of forms of credit risk mitigation include a security interest in financial and non financial assets collateral netting and guarantees where permissible we apply the recognition of collateral guarantees and netting to mitigate overall risk within our counterparty credit portfolio while credit default swaps are permitted under the basel iii final rule we do not actively use credit default swaps as a risk mitigation tool state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations collateral in many parts of our business we regularly require or agree for collateral to be received from or provided to clients and counterparties in connection with contracts that involve credit risk in our trading businesses this collateral is typically in the form of cash as well as highlyrated andor liquid securities ie government securities and other bonds or equity securities credit risks in our nontrading and securities finance businesses are also often secured by bonds and equity securities and by other types of assets collateral serves to reduce the risk of loss inherent in an exposure however changing market values of the collateral we hold unexpected increases in the credit exposure to a client or counterparty reductions in the value or change in the type of securities held by us as well as operational errors or errors in the manner in which we seek to exercise our rights may reduce the risk mitigation effects of collateral while collateral is often an alternative source of repayment it does not replace the requirement within our policies and guidelines for highquality underwriting we also may choose to incur credit exposure without the benefit of collateral or other risk mitigating credits rights our credit risk guidelines require that the collateral we accept for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality can be reliably valued and is supported by a valid security interest that permits liquidation if or when required generally when collateral is of lower quality more difficult to value or more challenging to liquidate higher discounts to market values are applied for the purposes of measuring credit risk for certain less liquid collateral longer liquidation periods are assumed when determining the credit exposure all types of collateral are assessed regularly by erm as is the basis on which the collateral is valued our assessment of collateral including the ability to liquidate collateral in the event of a counterparty default and also with regard to market values of collateral under a variety of hypothetical market conditions is an integral component of our assessment of risk and approval of credit limits we also seek to identify limit and monitor instances of wrongway risk where a counterpartys risk of default is positively correlated with the risk of our collateral eroding in value we maintain policies and procedures requiring that documentation used to collateralize a transaction is legal valid binding and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions we also conduct legal reviews to assess whether our documentation meets these standards on an ongoing basis netting netting is a mechanism that allows institutions and counterparties to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another through the use of qualifying master netting agreements a master netting agreement allows for certain rights and remedies upon a counterparty default including the right to net obligations arising under derivatives or other transactions under such agreement in such an event the netting of obligations would result in a single net claim owed by or to the counterparty this is commonly referred to as closeout netting and is pursued wherever possible we may also enter into master agreements that allow for the netting of amounts payable on a given day and in the same currency reducing our settlement risk this is commonly referred to as payment netting and is widely used in our foreign exchange activities as with collateral we have policies and procedures in place to apply closeout and payment netting only to the extent that we have verified legal validity and enforceability of the master agreement in the case of payment netting operational constraints may preclude us from reducing settlement risk notwithstanding the legal right to require the same under the master netting agreement in the event we become unable due to operational constraints actions by regulators changes in accounting principles law or regulation or related interpretations or other factors to net some or all of our offsetting exposures and payment obligations under those agreements we would be required to gross up our assets and liabilities on our statement of condition and our calculation of rwa accordingly this would result in a potentially material change in our regulatory ratios including lcr and present increased credit liquidity assetandliability management and operational risks some of which could be material guarantees a guarantee is a financial instrument that results in credit support being provided by a third party ie the protection provider to the underlying obligor the beneficiary of the provided protection on account of an exposure owing by the obligor the protection provider may support the underlying exposure either in whole or in part support of this kind may take different forms typical forms of guarantees provided to us include financial guarantees letters of credit bankers acceptances purchase undertaking agreement contracts and insurance we have established a review process to evaluate guarantees under the applicable requirements of our policies and basel iii requirements governance for this evaluation is covered under policies and procedures that require regular reviews of documentation jurisdictions and credit quality of protection providers state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit limits central to our philosophy for our management of credit risk is the approval and imposition of credit limits against which we monitor the actual and potential future credit exposure arising from our business activities with counterparties or groups of counterparties credit limits are a reflection of our risk appetite which may be determined by the creditworthiness of the counterparty the nature of the risk inherent in the business undertaken with the counterparty or a combination of relevant credit factors our risk appetite for certain sectors and certain countries and geographic regions may also influence the level of risk we are willing to assume to certain counterparties the analysis and approval of credit limits is undertaken similarly across our businesses although the nature and extent of the analysis may vary based on the type term and magnitude of the risk being assumed credit limits and underlying exposures are assessed and measured on both a gross and net basis where appropriate with net exposure determined by deducting the value of any collateral held for certain types of risk being assumed we will also assess and measure exposures under a variety of hypothetical market conditions credit limit approvals across our business are undertaken by the credit and global markets risk group by individuals to whom credit authority has been delegated or by the credit committee credit limits are reevaluated annually or more frequently as needed and are revised periodically on prevailing and anticipated market conditions changes in counterparty or countryspecific credit ratings and outlook changes in our risk appetite for certain counterparties sectors or countries and enhancements to the measurement of credit utilization reporting ongoing active monitoring and management of our credit risk is an integral part of our credit risk management framework we maintain management information systems to identify measure monitor and report credit risk across businesses and legal entities enabling erm and our businesses to have timely access to information on credit limits and exposures monitoring is performed along the dimensions of counterparty industry country and productspecific risks to facilitate the identification of concentrations of risk and emerging trends key aspects of this credit risk reporting structure include governance and oversight groups and policies that define standards for the reporting of credit risk data aggregation and sourcing systems the credit and global markets risk group routinely assesses the composition of our overall credit risk portfolio for alignment with our stated risk appetite this assessment includes routine analysis and reporting of the portfolio monitoring of marketbased indicators the assessment of industry trends and developments and regular reviews of concentrated risks the credit and global markets risk group is also responsible in conjunction with the business units for defining the appetite for credit risk in the major sectors in which we have a concentration of business activities these sectorlevel risk appetite statements which include counterparty selection criteria and granular underwriting guidelines are reviewed periodically and approved by the cmrc monitoring regular surveillance of credit and counterparty risks is undertaken by our business units the credit and global markets risk group and designees with erm allowing for oversight this surveillance process includes but is not limited to the following components annual reviews a formal review of counterparties is conducted at least annually and includes a review of operating performance primary risk factors and our internal credit risk rating this annual review also includes a review of current and proposed credit limits an assessment of our ongoing risk appetite and assessment that supporting legal documentation remains effective interim monitoring monitoring of our largest and riskiest counterparties is undertaken more frequently utilizing financial information market indicators and other relevant credit and performance measures the nature and extent of this interim monitoring is individually tailored to certain counterparties andor industry sectors to identify material changes to the risk profile of a counterparty or group of counterparties and assign an updated internal risk rating in a timely manner we maintain an active watch list for all counterparties the watch list status denotes a concern with some aspect of a counterpartys risk profile that warrants closer monitoring of the counterpartys financial performance and related risk factors our ongoing monitoring processes are designed to facilitate the early identification of counterparties whose creditworthiness is deteriorating any counterparty may be placed on the watch list by erm at its sole discretion counterparties on the watch list generally correspond with the noninvestment grade or near noninvestment grade ratings established by the major independent creditrating agencies the watch state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations list also includes any counterparties rated special mention substandard doubtful and loss the credit and global markets risk group maintains primary responsibility for our watch list processes and generates a quarterly report of all watch list counterparties the watch list is formally reviewed at least on a quarterly basis with participation from senior erm staff and representatives from the business units and our corporate finance and legal groups as appropriate these meetings include a review of individual watch list counterparties together with credit limits and prevailing exposures and are focused on actions to contain reduce or eliminate the risk of loss to us identified actions are documented and monitored controls gcr provides a separate level of surveillance and oversight over the integrity of our credit risk management processes including the internal riskrating system gcr reviews counterparty credit ratings for all identified sectors on an ongoing basis gcr is subject to oversight by the cmrc and provides periodic updates to the boards rc specific activities of gcr include the following perform separate and objective assessments of our credit and counterparty exposures to determine the nature and extent of risk undertaken by the business units execute periodic credit process and credit product reviews to assess the quality of credit analysis compliance with policies guidelines and relevant regulation transaction structures and underwriting standards and riskrating integrity identify and monitor developing counterparty market andor industry sector trends to limit risk of loss and protect capital deliver regular and formal reporting to stakeholders including exam results identified issues and the status of requisite actions to remedy identified deficiencies allocate resources for specialized risk assessments on an asneeded basis and liaise with assurance partners and regulatory personnel on matters relating to risk rating reporting and measurement allowance for credit losses we record an allowance for credit losses related to certain onbalance sheet credit exposures including our financial assets held at amortized cost as well as certain offbalance sheet credit exposures including unfunded commitments and letters of credit review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year but occurs at least quarterly and is based among other factors on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio and the estimated effects of our forecasts on our counterparties we utilize multiple economic scenarios consisting of a baseline upside and downside scenarios to develop our forecast of expected losses in the allowance estimate reflected a downward shift in our economic outlook which was partially offset by a reduction in loan portfolio risk allowance estimates are subject to uncertainties including those inherent in our model and economic assumptions and management may use qualitative adjustments if future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of december or if credit risk migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent of the economic forecast our allowance for credit losses will also change additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k liquidity risk management our liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk to our liquidity based on our activities size and other appropriate riskrelated factors in managing liquidity risk we employ limits maintain established metrics and early warning indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs this process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets we manage our liquidity on a global consolidated basis as well as on a standalone basis at our parent company and at certain branches and subsidiaries of state street bank state street bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks such as the federal funds market and the federal reserves discount window the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile reflecting narrower market access additionally the parent company typically holds or has direct access to primarily through ssif a direct subsidiary of the parent company and the support agreement as discussed in supervision and regulation in business in this form 10k cash and equivalents intended to meet its current debt maturities and other cash needs as well as those projected over the next twelvemonth period absent financial distress at the parent company the liquid assets available at ssif continue to be available to state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the parent company as of december the value of our parent companys net liquid assets totaled million compared with million as of december excluding available liquidity through ssif as of december our parent company and state street bank had approximately billion of senior notes or subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months as a sifi our liquidity risk management activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements including interpretations of those requirements under specific us and international regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance supervisory activities such as stress tests resolution planning examinations and other regulatory interactions satisfaction of these requirements could in some cases result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio reduced nii or nim a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the way in which we deliver our products and services if we fail to meet regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators we could receive negative regulatory stress test results incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a noncredible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding our efforts to satisfy or our failure to satisfy these regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations governance global treasury is responsible for our management of liquidity this includes the daytoday management of our global liquidity position the development and monitoring of early warning indicators key liquidity risk metrics the creation and execution of stress tests the evaluation and implementation of regulatory requirements the maintenance and execution of our liquidity guidelines and contingency funding plan cfp and routine management reporting to alco mrac and the boards rc global treasury risk management part of erm provides separate oversight over the identification communication and management of global treasurys risks in support of our business strategy global treasury risk management reports to the cro global treasury risk managements responsibilities relative to liquidity risk management include the development and review of policies and guidelines the monitoring of limits related to adherence to the liquidity risk guidelines and associated reporting liquidity framework we manage liquidity according to several principles that are equally important to our overall liquidity risk management framework structural liquidity management addresses liquidity by monitoring and directing the composition of our consolidated statement of condition structural liquidity is measured by metrics such as the percentage of total wholesale funds to consolidated total assets and the percentage of nongovernment investment securities to client deposits in addition on a regular basis and as described below our structural liquidity is evaluated under various stress scenarios tactical liquidity management addresses our daytoday funding requirements and is largely driven by changes in our primary source of funding which are client deposits fluctuations in client deposits may be supplemented with shortterm borrowings repurchase agreements fhlb products and certificates of deposit stress testing and contingent funding planning are longerterm strategic liquidity risk management practices regular and ad hoc liquidity stress testing are performed under various severe but plausible scenarios at the consolidated level and at significant subsidiaries including state street bank these tests contemplate severe market and events specific to us under various time horizons and severities tests contemplate the impact of material changes in key funding sources credit ratings additional collateral requirements contingent uses of funding systemic shocks to the financial markets and operational failures based on market and assumptions specific to us the stress tests evaluate the required level of funding versus available sources in an adverse environment as stress testing contemplates potential forwardlooking scenarios results also serve as a trigger to activate specific liquidity stress levels and contingent funding actions cfps are designed to assist senior management with decisionmaking associated with any contingency funding response to a possible or actual crisis scenario the cfps define roles responsibilities and management actions to be taken in the event of deterioration of our liquidity profile caused by either an event specific to us or a broader disruption in the capital markets specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity risk metrics in managing our liquidity we employ early warning indicators and metrics intended to detect situations which may result in a liquidity stress including changes in our stock price and spreads on our longterm debt additional metrics that are critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and monitored as part of our routine liquidity management include measures of our fungible cash position purchased wholesale funds unencumbered liquid assets deposits and the total of investment securities and loans as a percentage of total client deposits asset liquidity central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity which consists primarily of hqla hqla is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the lcr as a banking organization we are subject to a minimum lcr under the lcr rule approved by us banking regulators the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of internationally active banking organizations like us to improve the banking industrys ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk the lcr measures an institutions hqla against its net cash outflows hqla primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the lcr rule we report lcr to the federal reserve daily for the quarters ended december and daily average lcr for the parent company was and respectively the impact of higher deposits on the parent companys lcr is offset by a cap known as the transferability restriction on the hqla from state street bank and trust that can be recognized at the parent company as defined in the us lcr final rule as it prohibits the upstreaming of liquidity under stress the average hqla postprescribed haircuts for the parent company under the lcr final rule definition was billion and billion for the quarters ended december and respectively the decrease in average hqla for the quarter ended december compared to the quarter ended december was primarily driven by a decrease in client deposits for the quarter ended december lcr for state street bank and trust was approximately state street bank and trusts lcr is higher than the parent companys lcr primarily due to application of the transferability restriction in the lcr final rule to the calculation of the parent companys lcr this restriction limits the hqla used in the calculation of the parent companys lcr to the amount of net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary state street bank and trust this transferability restriction does not apply in the calculation of state street bank and trusts lcr and therefore state street bank and trusts lcr reflects the benefit of all of its hqla holdings we maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the federal reserve of approximately billion at the federal reserve the ecb and other nonus central banks for the quarter ended december and billion for the quarter ended december the higher levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect higher levels of client deposits liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the federal reserve bank of boston frbb the fhlb and other nonus central banks state street bank is a member of the fhlb this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against highquality collateral which helps facilitate assetandliability management as of december and we had no outstanding borrowings from the fhlb access to primary intraday and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions as of december and we had no outstanding prim ary credit borrowings from the frbb discount window or any other central bank facility in addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity we have other unencumbered investment securities these securities are available sources of liquidity although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset liquidity the average fair value of total unencumbered securities was billion for the quarter ended december compared to billion for the quarter ended december measures of liquidity include lcr and nsfr which are described in supervision and regulation in business in this form 10k uses of liquidity significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following withdrawals of client deposits drawdowns by our custody clients of lines of credit advances to clients to settle securities transactions increases in our investment and loan portfolios or other permitted purposes such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings a recurring use of our liquidity involves our deployment of hqla from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our enhanced custody program we had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling billion state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and billion and standby letters of credit totaling billion and billion as of december and respectively these amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral as of december approximately of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and of our standby letters of credit expire within one year since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements information about our resolution planning and the impact actions under our resolution plans could have on our liquidity is provided in supervision and regulation in business in this form 10k funding deposits we provide products and services including custody accounting administration daily pricing fx services cash management financial asset management securities finance and investment advisory services as a provider of these products and services we generate client deposits which have generally provided a stable lowcost source of funds as a global custodian clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies as of both december and approximately of our average total deposit balances were denominated in us dollars in eur in gbp and in all other currencies shortterm funding our onbalance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets but more importantly they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales in addition our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors as discussed earlier under asset liquidity state street banks membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against highquality collateral shortterm secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase these transactions are shortterm in nature generally overnight and are collateralized by highquality investment securities these balances were billion and billion as of december and respectively state street bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of cad billion or approximately

in secured lending transactions and engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings a downgrade or reduction in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets which could increase the related cost of funds in turn this could cause the sudden and largescale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients which could lead to drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by the major rating

results of operations operational risk management overview operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events tight labor markets challenging conditions in the global equity and fixed income markets and heightened geopolitical tensions including the ongoing war in ukraine are resulting in stress on the operating environment and have increased and may continue to increase operational risk the war in ukraine may also heighten information technology risk exposures including cyberthreats see also information technology risk management below operational risk encompasses fiduciary risk and legal risk fiduciary risk is defined as the risk that we fail to properly exercise our fiduciary duties in our provision of products or services to clients legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations operational risk is inherent in the performance of investment servicing and investment management activities on behalf of our clients whether it be fiduciary risk risk associated with execution and processing or other types of operational risk a consistent transparent and effective operational risk framework is key to identifying monitoring and managing operational risk we have established an operational risk framework that is based on three major goals strong active governance ownership and accountability and consistency and transparency governance our board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall operational risk framework it does so through its tops which reviews our operational risk framework and recommends rc approval of our operational risk policy annually our operational risk policy establishes our approach to our management of operational risk across our business the policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of operational risk and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the operational risk framework erm and other control groups provide the oversight validation and verification of the management and measurement of operational risk executive management actively manages and oversees our operational risk framework through membership on various risk management committees including mrac the bcc torc the operational risk and controls committee the cybersecurity risk committee the enterprise continuity steering committee the compliance and ethics committee the third party and outsourcing risk committee and the fiduciary review committee all of which ultimately report to the appropriate committee of the board the operational risk and controls committee chaired by the global head of operational risk provides crossbusiness oversight of operational risk operational risk programs and their implementation to identify measure manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner and reviews and approves operational risk guidelines intended to maintain a consistent implementation of our corporate operational risk policy and framework ownership and accountability we have implemented our operational risk framework to support the broad mandate established by our operational risk policy this framework represents a set of processes and tools that assists us in the management and measurement of operational risk including our calculation of required capital and rwa the framework utilizes aspects of the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso framework and other industry leading practices and is designed foremost to address our risk management needs while complying with regulatory requirements the operational risk framework is intended to provide a number of important benefits including a common understanding of operational risk management and its supporting processes the clarification of responsibilities for the management of operational risk across our business the alignment of business priorities with risk management objectives the active management of risk and early identification of emerging risks the consistent application of policies and the collection of data for risk management and measurement and the estimation of our operational risk capital requirement the operational risk framework employs a distributed risk management infrastructure executed by erm groups aligned with the business units which are responsible for the implementation of the operational risk framework at the business unit level as with other risks senior business unit management is responsible for the daytoday operational risk management of their respective state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations businesses it is business unit managements responsibility to provide oversight of the implementation and ongoing execution of the operational risk framework within their respective organizations as well as coordination and communication with erm consistency and transparency a number of corporate control functions are directly responsible for implementing and assessing various aspects of our operational risk framework with the overarching goal of consistency and transparency to meet the evolving needs of the business the global head of operational risk a member of the cros executive management team leads erms corporate orm group orm is responsible for the strategy evolution and consistent implementation of our operational risk guidelines framework and supporting tools across our business orm reviews and analyzes operational key risk information events metrics and indicators at the business unit and corporate level for purposes of risk management reporting and escalation to the cro senior management and governance committees erms centralized modeling and analytics group develops and maintains operational risk capital estimation models and orms capital analysis group calculates our required capital for operational risk erms mvg validates the quantitative models used to measure operational risk and orm performs validation checks on the output of the model gcs establishes the framework policies and related programs to measure monitor and report on information security risks including the effectiveness of cybersecurity program protections gcs defines and manages the enterprisewide information security program gcs coordinates with information technology control functions and business units to support the confidentiality integrity and availability of corporate information assets gcs identifies and employs a riskbased methodology consistent with applicable regulatory cybersecurity requirements and monitors the compliance of our systems with information security policies and corporate audit performs separate reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies utilized across our business our operational risk framework consists of five components each described below risk identification and assessments the objective of risk identification and assessments is to understand business unit strategy risk profile and potential exposures it is achieved through a series of risk assessments across our business using techniques for the identification assessment and measurement of risk across a spectrum of potential frequency and severity combinations including businessspecific programs to identify assess and measure risk such as new business and product review and approval new client screening and as deemed appropriate targeted risk assessments two primary risk assessment programs which occur annually augmented by other businessspecific programs are the core of this component the risk and control assessment program seeks to understand the risks associated with daytoday activities and the effectiveness of controls intended to manage potential exposures arising from these activities these risks are typically frequent in nature but generally not severe in terms of exposure and the material risk identification process utilizes a bottomup approach to identify our most significant risk exposures across all on and offbalance sheet risktaking activities the program is specifically designed to consider risks that could have a material impact irrespective of their likelihood or frequency this can include risks that may have an impact on longerterm business objectives such as significant change management activities or longterm strategic initiatives capital analysis the primary measurement tool used is an internally developed loss distribution approach lda model we use the lda model to quantify required operational risk capital from which we calculate rwa related to operational risk such required capital and rwa totaled billion and billion respectively as of december compared to billion and billion respectively as of december refer to the capital section in financial condition of this managements discussion and analysis the lda model incorporates the three required operational risk elements described below internal loss event data is collected from across our business in conformity with our operating loss policy that establishes the state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations requirements for collecting and reporting individual loss events we categorize the data into seven baseldefined event types and further subdivide the data by business unit as deemed appropriate each of these loss events are represented in a uom which is used to estimate a specific amount of capital required for the types of loss events that fall into each specific category some uoms are measured at the corporate level because they are not business specific such as damage to physical assets where the cause of an event is not primarily driven by the behavior of a single business unit internal losses of or greater are captured analyzed and included in the modeling approach loss event data is collected using a corporatewide data collection tool incident capture and management system icams to support processes related to analysis management reporting and the calculation of required capital internal loss event data provides our frequency and severity information to our capital calculation process for historical loss events experienced by us internal loss event data may be incorporated into our lda model in a future quarter following the realization of the losses with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and if applicable model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes an individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our lda model and our operational risk rwa under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event its categorization among the seven baseldefined uoms and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom external loss event data provides information with respect to loss event severity from other financial institutions to inform our capital estimation process of events in similar business units at other banking organizations this information supplements the data pool available for use in our lda model assessments of the sufficiency of internal data and the relevance of external data are completed before pooling the two data sources for use in our lda model and business environment and internal control factors are gathered from internal loss event data and businessrelevant metrics such as risk assessment program results along with industry loss event data and case studies where appropriate business environment and internal control factors are those characteristics of a banks internal and external operating environment that bear an exposure to operational risk the use of this information indirectly influences our calculation of required capital by providing additional relevant data to workshop participants when reviewing specific uom risks monitoring reporting and analytics the objective of risk monitoring is to proactively monitor the changing business environment and corresponding operational risk exposure it is achieved through a series of quantitative and qualitative monitoring tools that are designed to allow us to understand changes in the business environment internal control factors risk metrics risk assessments exposures and operating effectiveness as well as details of loss events and progress on risk initiatives implemented to mitigate potential risk exposures operational risk reporting is intended to provide transparency thereby enabling management to manage risk provide oversight and escalate issues in a timely manner it is designed to allow the business units executive management and the boards control functions and committees to gain insight into activities that may result in risks and potential exposures reports are intended to identify business activities that are experiencing processing issues whether or not they result in actual loss events reporting includes results of monitoring activities internal and external examinations regulatory reviews and control assessments these elements combine in a manner designed to provide a view of potential and emerging risks facing us and information that details its progress on managing risks effectiveness and testing the objective of effectiveness and testing is to verify that internal controls are designed appropriately are consistent with corporate and regulatory standards and are operating effectively it is achieved through a series of assessments by both internal and external parties independent registered public accounting firms business selfassessments and other control function reviews such as a sarbanesoxley act of sox testing program consistent with our standard model validation process the operational risk lda model is subject to a detailed review overseen by the mrc in addition the model is subject to a rigorous internal governance process all changes to the model or input parameters and the deployment of model updates are reviewed and approved by the operational risk and controls committee which has oversight state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations responsibility for the model with technical input from the mrc documentation and guidelines documentation and guidelines allow for consistency and repeatability of the various processes that support the operational risk framework across our business operational risk guidelines document our practices and describe the key elements in a business units operational risk management program the purpose of the guidelines is to set forth and define key operational risk terms provide further detail on our operational risk programs and detail the business units responsibilities to identify assess measure monitor and report operational risk the guideline supports our operational

information technology risk framework as outlined above under the direction of our chief information security officer we recognize the significance of cyberattacks and have taken steps to mitigate the risks associated with them we have invested in building a mature cybersecurity program to leverage people technology and processes to protect our systems and the data in our care we have also implemented a program to help us better measure and manage the cybersecurity risk we face when we engage with third parties for services all employees are required to adhere to our cybersecurity policy and standards our centralized information security group provides education and training this training includes a required annual online training class for all employees multiple simulated phishing attacks and regular information security awareness materials we employ information security officers to help the business better understand and manage their information security risks as well as to work with the centralized information security team to drive awareness and compliance throughout the business we use independent third parties to perform ethical hacks of key systems to help us better understand the effectiveness of our controls and to better implement more effective controls and we engage with third parties to conduct reviews of our overall program to help us better align our cybersecurity program with what is required of a large financial services organization we have an incident response program in place that is designed to enable a wellcoordinated response to

which is a function of our overall risk appetite business objectives and liquidity needs our clients requirements and market volatility and our execution against those factors we engage in trading activities primarily to support our clients needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity in connection with certain of these trading activities we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risk these activities are generally intended to generate foreign exchange trading services revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility in addition we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities with the growth of crossborder investing our clients often enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets we provide foreign exchange forward and option contracts in support of these client needs and also act as a dealer in the currency markets as part of our trading activities we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps interest rate forward contracts and interest rate futures as of december the notional amount of these derivative contracts was trillion of which trillion was composed of foreign

trading businesses and other members of management who possess specialized knowledge the cmrc meets regularly to monitor the management of our trading market risk activities our business units identify manage and are responsible for the market risks inherent in their businesses a dedicated market risk management group within erm and other groups within erm work with those business units to assist them in the identification assessment monitoring management and control of market risk and assist business unit managers with their market risk management and measurement activities erm provides an additional line of oversight support and coordination designed to promote the consistent identification measurement and management of market risk across business units separate from those business units discrete activities the erm market risk management group is responsible for the management of corporatewide market risk the monitoring of key market risks and the development and maintenance of market risk management policies guidelines and standards aligned with our corporate risk appetite this group also establishes and approves market risk tolerance limits and trading authorities based on but not limited to measures of notional amounts sensitivity var and stress such limits and authorities are specified in our trading and market risk guidelines which govern our management of trading market risk risk appetite our corporate market risk appetite is specified in policy statements that outline the governance responsibilities and requirements surrounding the identification measurement analysis management and communication of market risk arising from our trading activities these policy statements also set forth the market risk control framework designed to monitor support manage and control this portion of our risk appetite all groups involved in the management and control of market risk associated with trading activities are required to comply with the qualitative and quantitative elements of these policy statements our trading market risk control framework is composed of the following a trading market risk management process led by erm separate from the business units discrete activities defined responsibilities and authorities for the primary groups involved in trading market risk management a trading market risk measurement methodology that captures correlation effects and allows aggregation of market risk across risk types markets and business lines daily monitoring analysis and reporting of market risk exposures associated with trading activities against market risk limits a defined limit structure and escalation process in the event of a market risk limit excess use of var models to measure the oneday market risk exposure of trading positions use of var as a tendaybased regulatory capital measure of the market risk exposure of trading positions use of nonvarbased limits and other controls use of stressedvar models stresstesting analysis and scenario analysis to support the trading market risk measurement and management process by assessing how portfolios and global business lines perform under extreme market conditions use of backtesting as a diagnostic tool to assess the accuracy of var models and other risk management techniques and a new product approval process that requires market risk teams to assess tradingrelated market risks and apply risk tolerance limits to proposed new products and business activities we use our cap to assess our overall capital and liquidity in relation to our risk profile and provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity levels with respect to market risk associated with trading activities our risk management and our calculations of regulatory capital are based primarily on our internal var models and stress testing analysis as discussed in detail under valueatrisk and stressed var below var is measured daily by erm the cmrc oversees our market risk exposure in relation to limits established within our risk appetite framework these limits define threshold levels for state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations var and stressed varbased measures and are applicable to all trading positions subject to regulatory capital requirements these limits are designed to mitigate undue concentration of market risk exposure in light of the primarily nonproprietary nature of our trading activities the risk appetite framework and associated limits are reviewed and approved by the boards rc covered positions our trading positions are subject to regulatory market risk capital requirements if they meet the regulatory definition of a covered position a covered position is generally defined by us banking regulators as an on or offbalance sheet position associated with the organizations trading activities that is free of any restrictions on its tradability but does not include intangible assets certain credit derivatives recognized as guarantees and certain equity positions not publicly traded all fx and commodity positions are considered covered positions regardless of the accounting treatment they receive the identification of covered positions for inclusion in our market risk capital framework is governed by our trading and market risk guidelines which outlines the standards we use to determine whether a trading position is a covered position our covered positions consist primarily of the trading portfolios held by our global markets business they also arise from certain positions held by our global treasury group these trading positions include products such as foreign exchange spot foreign exchange forwards nondeliverable forwards foreign exchange options foreign exchange funding swaps currency futures financial futures and interest rate futures new activities are analyzed to determine if the positions arising from such new activities meet the definition of a covered position and conform to our trading and market risk guidelines this documented analysis including any decisions with respect to market risk treatments must receive approval from the cmrc we use spot rates forward points yield curves and discount factors imported from thirdparty sources to measure the value of our covered positions and we use such values to mark our covered positions to market on a daily basis these values are subject to separate validation by us in order to evaluate reasonableness and consistency with market experience the marktomarket gain or loss on spot transactions is calculated by applying the spot rate to the foreign currency principal and comparing the resultant base currency amount to the original transaction principal the marktomarket gain or loss on a forward foreign exchange contract or forward cash flow contract is determined as the difference between the lifetodate historical value of the cash flow and the value of the cash flow at the inception of the transaction the marktomarket gain or loss on interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows from each leg of the swap transaction valueatrisk and stressed var we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies including var which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval we use a risk measurement methodology to measure tradingrelated var daily we have adopted standards for measuring tradingrelated var and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements we utilize an internal var model to calculate our regulatory market risk capital requirements we use a historical simulation model to calculate daily var and stressed varbased measures for our covered positions in conformity with regulatory requirements our var model seeks to capture identified material risk factors associated with our covered positions including risks arising from market movements such as changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and optionimplied volatilities we have adopted standards and guidelines to value our covered positions which govern our var and stressed varbased measures our regulatory varbased measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a twoyear observation period calibrated to a onetail confidence interval and a tenbusinessday holding period we also use the same platform to calculate a onetail confidence interval onebusinessday var for internal risk management purposes a onetail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses are not expected to exceed the estimated var more than of the time or less than three business days out of a year our market risk models including our var model are subject to change in connection with the governance validation and backtesting processes described below these models can change as a result of changes in our business activities our historical experiences market forces and events regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors in addition the models are subject to continuing regulatory review and approval changes in our models may result in changes in our measurements of our market risk exposures including var and related measures including regulatory capital these changes could result in material changes in those risk measurements and related measures as calculated and compared from period to period state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations valueatrisk measures var measures are based on the most recent two years of historical price movements for instruments and related risk factors to which we have exposure the instruments in question are limited to foreign exchange spot forward and options contracts and interest rate contracts including futures and interest rate swaps historically these instruments have exhibited a higher degree of liquidity relative to other available capital markets instruments as a result the var measures shown reflect our ability to rapidly adjust exposures in highly dynamic markets for this reason risk inventory in the form of net open positions across all currencies is typically limited in addition long and short positions in major as well as minor currencies provide risk offsets that limit our potential downside exposure our var methodology uses a historical simulation approach based on marketobserved changes in foreign exchange rates us and nonus interest rates and implied volatilities and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions our var model incorporates approximately risk factors and includes correlations among currency interest rates and other market rates all var measures are subject to limitations and must be interpreted accordingly some but not all of the limitations of our var methodology include the following compared to a shorter observation period a twoyear observation period is slower to reflect increases in market volatility although temporary increases in market volatility will affect the calculation of var for a longer period consequently in periods of sudden increases in volatility or increasing volatility in each case relative to the prior twoyear period the calculation of var may understate current risk compared to a longer observation period a twoyear observation period may not reflect as many past periods of volatility in the markets because such past volatility is no longer in the observation period consequently historical market scenarios of high volatility even if similar to current or likely future market circumstances may fall outside the twoyear observation period resulting in a potential understatement of current risk the varbased measure is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and does not indicate the potential magnitude of losses beyond this confidence level in certain cases varbased measures approximate the impact of changes in risk factors on the values of positions and portfolios this may happen because the number of inputs included in the var model is necessarily limited for example yield curve risk factors do not exist for all future dates the use of historical market information may not be predictive of future events particularly those that are extreme in nature this backwardlooking limitation can cause var to understate or overstate risk the effect of extreme and rare market movements is difficult to estimate this may result from nonlinear risk sensitivities as well as the potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in the var calculations and intraday risk is not captured we calculate a stressed varbased measure using the same model we use to calculate var but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelvemonth periods that reflect significant financial stress the stressed var model is designed to identify the secondworst outcome occurring in the worst continuous oneyear rolling period since july this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling tenday period with an outcome that is worse than of other outcomes during that twelvemonth period of financial stress for each portfolio the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the oneyear time horizon that produces the largest tenbusinessday var from within the available historical data this historical data set includes the financial crisis of the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard poors downgrade of us treasury debt in august as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time future market stress events will be incorporated state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations stress testing we have a corporatewide stress testing program in place that incorporates techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions we also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch risk component and currency pairs we conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur and we also perform stress testing as part of the federal reserves ccar process stress testing is conducted analyzed and reported at the corporate trading desk division and riskfactor level for example exchange risk interest rate risk and volatility risk stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by erm and reported to the cmrc limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units escalated as appropriate and reviewed by the cmrc if material in addition we have established several action triggers that prompt immediate review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan we perform scenario analysis daily based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur relevant scenarios are chosen from an inventory of historical financial stresses and applied to our current portfolio these historical event scenarios involve spot foreign exchange credit equity unforeseen geopolitical events and natural disasters and government and central bank intervention scenarios examples of the specific historical scenarios we incorporate in our stress testing program may include the asian financial crisis of the september terrorist attacks in the us and the financial crisis we continue to update our inventory of historical stress scenarios as new stress conditions emerge in the financial markets as each of the historical stress events is associated with a different time horizon we normalize results by scaling down the longer horizon events to a tenday horizon and keeping the shorter horizon events ie events that are shorter than ten days at their original terms we also conduct sensitivity analysis daily to calculate the impact of a large predefined shock in a specific risk factor or a group of risk factors on our current portfolio these predefined shocks include parallel and nonparallel yield curve shifts and foreign exchange spot and volatility surface shifts in a parallel shift scenario we apply a constant factor shift across all yield curve tenors in a nonparallel shift scenario we apply different shock levels to different tenors of a yield curve rather than shifting the entire curve by a constant amount nonparallel shifts include steepening flattening and butterflies validation and backtesting we perform frequent backtesting to assess the accuracy of our varbased model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level this backtesting involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily actual profitandloss pl outcomes observed from daily market movements we backtest our var model using clean pl which excludes nontrading revenue such as fees commissions and nii as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves such as fees commissions changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday activity we experienced three backtesting exceptions in and one backtesting exception in at a confidence interval the statistical expectation for a var model is to witness one exception every hundred trading days or two to three exceptions per year two backtesting exceptions occurred on days of higher volatility on the back of market concerns on economic outlook inflation and central bank rate policy a third backtesting exception occurred during the uk market turmoil in late september the backtesting exception has been attributed to dislocation in fx markets caused by greater demand for funding over yearend periods our model validation process also evaluates the integrity of our var models through the use of regular outcome analysis this outcome analysis includes backtesting which compares the var models predictions to actual outcomes using outofsample information consistent with regulatory guidance the backtesting compared clean pl defined above with the oneday var produced by the model the backtesting was performed for a time period not used for model development the number of occurrences where clean tradingbook pl exceeded the oneday var was within our

rates while many market factors affect the level of nii and the economic value of our assets and liabilities one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates most of our nii is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance

results of operations risk management state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations model risk management the use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making the models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a source of risk in large banking organizations like us model results influence business decisions and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance as a result the mrm framework seeks to mitigate our model risk our mrm program has three principal components a model risk governance program that defines roles and responsibilities including the authority to restrict model usage provides policies and guidance monitors compliance and reports regularly to the board on the overall degree of model risk across the corporation a model development process that focuses on sound design and computational accuracy and includes activities designed to assess data quality to test for robustness stability and sensitivity to assumptions and to conduct ongoing monitoring of model performance and an independent model validation function designed to verify that models are conceptually sound computationally accurate are performing as expected and are in line with their intended use the mrm framework highlighted above also provides insight and guidance into addressing key model risks that arise governance models used in the regulatory capital calculation can only be deployed for use after undergoing a model validation by erms mrm group the model validation results andor a decision by the model risk committee must permit model usage or the model may not be used erms mrm group is responsible for defining the corporatewide model risk management framework maintaining policies that are designed to achieve the frameworks objectives all regulatory capital calculation models including any artificial intelligence and machine learning models must comply with the model risk management framework and corresponding policies the team is responsible for overall model risk governance capabilities with particular emphasis in the areas of model validation model risk reporting model performance monitoring tracking of new model development status and committeelevel review and challenge mrc which is composed of senior managers responsible for representing functional areas and business units with key models across the organization reports to mrac and provides guidance and oversight to the mrm function model development and ongoing monitoring models are developed under standards governing data sourcing methodology selection and model integrity testing model development includes a statement of purpose to align development with intended use it may also include a comparison of alternative approaches to promote a sound modeling approach model developers conduct an assessment of data quality and relevance the development teams conduct a variety of tests of the accuracy robustness and stability of each model model owners submit models to the mvg for validation on a regular basis as per the existing policy the model owners also conduct ongoing monitoring of each model model validation mvg is part of mrm within erm and performs model validations and reviews mvg is independent as contemplated by applicable bank regulatory requirements of both the developers and users of the models mvg validates models through an evaluation process that assesses the appropriateness accuracy and suitability of data inputs methodologies documentation assumptions and processing code model validation also encompasses an assessment of model performance sensitivity and robustness as well as a models potential limitations given its particular assumptions or deficiencies based on the results of its review mvg issues a model use decision and may require remedial actions andor compensating controls on model use mvg also maintains a model risk rating system which assigns a risk rating to each model based on an assessment of a models inherent and residual risks these ratings aid in the understanding and reporting of model risk across the model portfolio and enable the triaging of needs for remediation although model validation is the primary method of subjecting models to independent review and challenge in practice a multistep governance process provides the opportunity for challenge by multiple parties first mvg conducts a model validation and issues a model use decision mvg communicates their result as one of the following three outcomes approved approved with conditions or not approved there are three ways state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in which a model can be deemed not approved for use given a validation the aggregation of the model scoring within mrms model risk rating system is poor enough to result in a high rating the scoring of one or more model risk rating system elements is deemed critical resulting in an automatic high rating irrespective of the other elements as the critical elements undermines the model or the remediation action is not properly taken by the due date resulting in a severe compliance breach that undercuts the model rating second these decisions may be reviewed challenged and confirmed by the mrc finally model use decisions risk ratings and overall levels of model risk may be reported to and reviewed by mrac mrm also reports regularly on model risk issues to the board strategic risk management we define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions improper implementation of strategic initiatives or lack of responsiveness to industrywide changes strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment decline in market performance or changes in our business activities and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks not already captured as market interest rate credit operational model or liquidity risks we incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult for instance the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a strategic risk loss an additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a major acquisition failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk strategic risk is managed with a longterm focus techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans which are subject to review and challenge from senior management and the board of directors as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals the potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision we use a combination of historical earnings volatility scenario analysis stresstesting and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk management and control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units with oversight from the control functions as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes capital managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives we assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements as well as our own internal capital goals targets and other relevant metrics framework our objective with respect to management of our capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs including funding corporate growth and supporting clients cash management needs and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors we strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital commensurate with our risk profile on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and longterm while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and complying with regulatory capital requirements our capital management focuses on our risk exposures the regulatory requirements applicable to us with respect to multiple capital measures the evaluations and resulting credit ratings of the major independent rating agencies our return on capital at both the consolidated and lineofbusiness level and our capital position relative to our peers assessment of our overall capital adequacy includes the comparison of capital sources with capital uses as well as the consideration of the quality and quantity of the various components of capital the assessment seeks to determine the optimal level of capital and composition of capital instruments to satisfy all constituents of capital with the lowest overall cost to shareholders other factors considered in our assessment of capital adequacy are strategic and contingency planning stress testing and planned capital actions capital adequacy process cap our primary federal banking regulator is the federal reserve both we and state street bank are subject to the minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations improvement act state street bank must exceed the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for our parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company accordingly one of our primary objectives with respect to capital management is to exceed all applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements and for state street bank to be well capitalized under the pca guidelines established by the fdic our capital management activities are conducted as part of our corporatewide cap and associated capital policy and guidelines we consider capital adequacy to be a key element of our financial wellbeing which affects our ability to attract and maintain client relationships operate effectively in the global capital markets and satisfy regulatory security holders and shareholder needs capital is one of several elements that affect our credit ratings and the ratings of our principal subsidiaries in conformity with our capital policy and guidelines we strive to achieve and maintain specific internal capital levels not just at a point in time but over time and during periods of stress to account for changes in our strategic direction evolving economic conditions and financial and market volatility we have developed and implemented a corporatewide cap to assess our overall capital in relation to our risk profile and to provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital levels the cap considers material risks under multiple scenarios with an emphasis on stress scenarios and encompasses existing processes and systems used to measure our capital adequacy capital contingency planning contingency planning is an integral component of capital management the objective of contingency planning is to monitor current and forecast levels of select capital liquidity and other measures that serve as early indicators of a potentially adverse capital or liquidity adequacy situation these measures are one of the inputs used to set our internal capital adequacy level we review these measures annually for appropriateness and relevance in relation to our financial budget and capital plan in addition we maintain an inventory of capital contingency actions designed to conserve or generate capital to support the unique risks in our business model our client and investor demands and regulatory requirements stress testing we administer a robust businesswide stresstesting program that executes stress tests each year to assess the institutions capital adequacy andor future performance under adverse conditions our stress testing program is structured around what we determine to be the key risks inherent in our business as assessed through a recurring material risk identification process the material risk identification process represents a bottomup approach to identifying the institutions most significant risk exposures across all on and offbalance sheet risktaking activities including credit market liquidity interest rate operational fiduciary business reputation and regulatory risks these key risks serve as an organizing principle for much of our risk management framework as well as reporting including the risk dashboard provided to the board in connection with the focus on our key risks each stress test incorporates idiosyncratic loss events tailored to our unique risk profile and business activities due to the nature of our business model and our consolidated statement of condition our risks differ from those of a traditional commercial bank over the past few years stress scenarios have included a deep recession in the us including impacts from the covid19 pandemic a breakup of the eurozone a severe recession in china and an oil shock precipitated by turmoil in the middle eastnorth africa region the federal reserve requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more which includes us to submit a capital plan on an annual basis the federal reserve uses its annual ccar process which incorporates hypothetical financial and economic stress scenarios to review those capital plans and assess whether banking organizations have capital planning processes that account for idiosyncratic risks and provide for sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress as part of its ccar process the federal reserve assesses each organizations capital adequacy capital planning process and plans to distribute capital such as dividend payments or stock purchase programs management and board risk committees review challenge and approve ccar results and assumptions before submission to the federal reserve through the evaluation of our capital adequacy andor future performance under adverse conditions the stress testing process provides us important insights for capital planning risk management and strategic decisionmaking governance in order to support integrated decision making we have identified three management elements to aid in the compatibility and coordination of our cap risk management identification measurement monitoring and forecasting of different types of risk and their combined impact on capital adequacy state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital management determination of optimal capital levels and business management strategic planning budgeting forecasting and performance management we have a hierarchical structure supporting appropriate committee review of relevant risk and capital information the ongoing responsibility for capital management rests with our treasurer the capital management group within global treasury is responsible for the capital policy and guidelines development of the capital plan the oversight of global capital management and optimization the mrac provides oversight of our capital management our capital adequacy our internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies in addition mrac approves our balance sheet strategy and related activities the boards rc assists the board in

important bank we have been identified by the financial stability board and the basel committee on banking supervision as a gsib our designation as a gsib is based on a number of factors as evaluated by banking regulators and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the basel iii rule we and our depositary institution subsidiaries are subject to the current basel iii minimum riskbased capital and leverage ratio guidelines additional information about gsibs is provided under regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity standards in supervision and regulation in business in this form 10k regulatory capital we and state street bank as advanced approaches banking organizations are subject to the us basel iii framework we are also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by us banking regulators the basel iii rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy the standardized approach and the advanced approaches applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations like us the standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk rwa including specified risk weights for certain on and offbalance sheet exposures the advanced approaches consist of the advanced internal ratingsbased approach used for the calculation of rwa related to credit risk and the advanced measurement approach used for the calculation of rwa related to operational risk as required by the doddfrank act enacted in we and state street bank as advanced approaches banking organizations are subject to a capital floor also referred to as the collins amendment in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy such that our riskbased capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced approaches and the standardized approach under th e advanced approaches state street and state street bank are subject to a ccb requirement plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer requirement which is currently set at under the standardized approach state street bank is subject to the same ccb and countercyclical capital buffer requirements but for state street the ccb requirement is replaced by the scb requirement according to the scb rule issued in in addition state street is subject to a gsib surcharge the scb replaced under the standardized approach the ccb with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institutions starting and lowest projected cet1 ratio under the ccar severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments as a percentage of rwa from the fourth through seventh quarter of the ccar planning horizon the scb requirement can be no less than of rwa breaching the scb or other regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a banking organizations ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers the countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero by us banking regulators our minimum riskbased capital ratios as of january include a ccb of and a scb of for the advanced approaches and standardized approach respectively a gsib surcharge of and a countercyclical buffer of this results in minimum riskbased ratios of for the common equity tier cet1 capital ratio for the tier capital ratio and for the total capital ratio our current gsib surcharge through december is based upon preliminary calculations using data as of december we currently anticipate that our surcharge will remain at through december however that calculation has not yet been finalized and is subject to many financial balance sheet market and other factors and consequently there is a risk that a higher gsib surcharge of will result from the final calculation state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to maintain the status of the parent company as a financial holding company we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required among other requirements to be well capitalized as defined by regulation y and regulation h the market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of var which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading positions defined by the rule as covered positions as well as stressedvar measures to supplement the var measures the rule also requires a public disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading

judgment by us and our regulators and our advanced systems may not individually or collectively precisely represent or calculate the scenarios circumstances outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval for example a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution even if we do not experience a related loss could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material

financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies by their nature require management to make judgments involving significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions the more significant accounting policies identified by management are recurring fair value measurements allowance for credit losses impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and contingencies these policies require the most subjective or complex judgments and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available an understanding of the judgments estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential to the understanding of our reported results of operations and financial condition the following is a discussion of the abovementioned significant accounting estimates additional information on our significant accounting policies including references to applicable footnotes is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k fair value measurements we carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis including trading account assets and liabilities afs debt securities certain equity securities and various types of derivative financial instruments changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders equity in our consolidated statement of condition in addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we estimate the state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below us gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date when we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities we consider the principal or the most advantageous market in which we would transact we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability when possible we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical or similar financial assets and liabilities when identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets we look to marketobservable data for similar assets and liabilities in some instances certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets as a result we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on us gaaps prescribed threelevel valuation hierarchy the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs level with respect to derivative instruments we evaluate the fair value impact of the credit risk of our counterparties we consider such factors as the marketbased probability of default by our counterparties and our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k allowance for credit losses we record an allowance for credit losses related to certain onbalance sheet credit exposures including our financial assets held at amortized cost as well as certain offbalance sheet credit exposures including unfunded commitments and letters of credit determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods we estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset while factoring in prepayment activity where supported by data over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period we utilize baseline upside and downside scenarios that are applied based on a probability weighting in order to better reflect managements expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment the multiple scenarios are based on a three year horizon or less depending on contractual maturity and then revert linearly over a two year period to a tenyear historical average thereafter the contractual term excludes expected extensions renewals and modifications but includes prepayment assumptions where applicable our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs including macroeconomic forecast assumptions and credit rating migrations during the period our macroeconomic forecasts used in determining the december allowance for credit losses consisted of three scenarios reflecting contractions in gdp and rising unemployment of varying severity with the baseline scenario generally in line with market consensus of economic forecasts for gdp and unemployment we placed the most weight on our baseline scenario with the remaining weighting split equally between the upside and downside scenarios keeping all other factors constant we estimate that if we had applied weighting to the downside scenario the allowance for credit losses as of december would have been approximately million higher this estimate is intended to reflect the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in our scenario weights and is not intended to be indicative of future changes in the allowance for credit losses additional information about our allowance for credit losses is provided in notes and to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired at the acquisition date other intangible assets represent purchased longlived intangible assets primarily client relationships core deposit intangible assets and technology that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract asset or liability other intangible assets are initially measured at their acquisition date fair value the determination of which requires management judgment goodwill is not amortized while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives management reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances arise or events occur that indicate an impairment of the carrying amount may exist we begin our review by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business economic or political climate an adverse action or assessment by a regulator unanticipated competition and a morelikelythannot expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate if we conclude from the qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is greater than its carrying amount quantitative tests are not required however if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying amount then we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete a quantitative assessment in any given year in we assessed goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment based on our evaluation of the qualitative factors noted above we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount we determined there was no goodwill impairment in other intangible assets are supported by the future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the intangible asset less any costs associated with the intangible assets eventual disposition we evaluate other intangible assets for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other groups of assets using the following process first we routinely assess whether impairment indicators are present when impairment indicators are identified as being present we compare the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows of the intangible asset with its carrying value if the future net undiscounted cash flows are greater than the carrying value then there is no impairment but if the intangible assets net undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value we are required to calculate impairment an impairment is recognized by writing the intangible asset down to its fair value we evaluate intangible assets for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis there were no impairments taken on other intangible assets in additional information about

made through global credit finance and issuances of longterm debt and preferred stock we have planned for and are prepared to transition our remaining balance sheet exposures in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance and the availability of interim solutions for various legacy libor contracts we will not originate or issue new liborbased loans or longterm debt and any purchases of liborbased investment securities will be screened for adequate fallback language our remaining exposure outstanding at the end of june is largely governed by existing fallback language or the libor act which provides for appropriate fallback provisions substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the market transition away from the use of libor as an interest rate benchmark in financial instruments and contracts our financial performance depends in part on our ability to adapt to market changes promptly while avoiding increased related expenses or operational errors
