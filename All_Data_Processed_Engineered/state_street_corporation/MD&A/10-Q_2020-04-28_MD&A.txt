additional information about the market risk associated with our trading activities refer to pages to included under item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our form 10k as part of our trading activities we assume positions in the fx and interestrate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments including fx forward contracts fx and interestrate options and interest rate swaps interest rate forward contracts and interest rate futures as of march the notional amount of these derivative contracts was trillion of which trillion was composed of fx forward swap and spot contracts we seek to match positions closely with the objective of tightly controlling related currency and interest rate risk all fx contracts are valued daily at current market rates valueatrisk and stressed valueatrisk we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies including var which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval we use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading related var daily we have adopted standards for measuring trading related var and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements our regulatory varbased measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a twoyear observation period calibrated to a onetail confidence interval and a tenbusinessday holding period we calculate a stressed varbased measure using the same model we use to calculate var but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelvemonth periods that reflect significant financial stress the stressed var model identifies the secondworst outcome occurring in the worst continuous oneyear rolling period since july this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling tenday period with an outcome that is worse than of other outcomes during that twelvemonth period of financial stress for each portfolio the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the oneyear time horizon that produces the largest tenbusinessday var from within the available historical data this historical data set includes the financial crisis of the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard poors downgrade of us treasury debt in august as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time future market stress events will be automatically incorporated for additional information about our var measurement tools and methodologies refer to pages to included under item managements discussion and analysis of

corporatewide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions we also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch risk component and currency pairs we conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur and we also perform stress testing as part of the federal reserves ccar process stress testing is conducted analyzed and reported at the corporate trading desk division and riskfactor level for example exchange risk interest rate risk and volatility risk stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by enterprise risk management erm and reported to the trading and markets risk committee tmrc limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units escalated as appropriate and reviewed by the tmrc if material in addition we have established several action triggers that prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan validation and backtesting we perform frequent backtesting to assess the accuracy of our varbased model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level this backtesting involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily actual profitandloss pl outcomes observed from daily market movements we backtest our var model using clean pl which excludes nontrading revenue such as fees commissions and nii as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves such as fees commissions changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday activity we had four backtesting exceptions in the quarter ended march all of which occurred during the heightened market volatility witnessed in march there were no backtesting exceptions in the quarter ended march and one backtesting exception in the quarter ended december the following tables present var and stressed var associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the quarters ended march

liability management is to provide sustainable nii under varying economic conditions while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates while many market factors affect the level of nii and the economic value of our assets and liabilities one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates most of our nii is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities including the currency composition of our significant nonus dollar denominated client liabilities we quantify nii sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning this measure compares our baseline view of

12month forward rates in table net interest income sensitivity we report the expected change in nii over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks to various tenors on the yield curve including the impacts from us and nonus rates each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate changes on our financial performance while investment securities balances can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change our modeling approach in the past has been to keep our balance sheet consistent with our baseline outlook in both higher and lower rate scenarios however for the march reporting period we reevaluated this approach for our bps shock scenario in light of the current rate environment under this scenario which assumes that the federal reserve increases its target range by to along with increases by other central banks client deposits are modeled to return to average balance levels experienced in the fourth quarter of with a corresponding reduction in cash and cash equivalents held with central banks for the bps shock scenario at march we held the balance sheet consistent with our baseline outlook including client deposits given the amount of fiscal stimulus and monetary policy easing already implied in the baseline scenario another factor was that the current bps scenario is impacted by assumed floors as interest rates reach zero for certain currencies including us dollar table net interest income sensitivity march march in millions us dollar all other currencies total us dollar all other currencies total rate change benefit exposure benefit exposure parallel shifts bps shock bps shock steeper yield curve bps shift in longend rates bps shift in shortend rates flatter yield curve bps shift in shortend rates bps shift in longend rates as of march nii sensitivity is expected to benefit from both parallel increases and decreases in interest rates compared to march our nii is more sensitive to parallel rate increases primarily driven by lower deposit beta assumptions given the current interest rate environment our positioning to parallel rate decreases has shifted to benefit nii driven by changes to the composition of our deposit base as well as impacts by assumed floors as interest rates in several currencies approach zero which prevents the full extent of the rate shock to be realized us dollar nii sensitivity as of march remains poised to benefit from a parallel rise in interest rates and our sensitivity to a parallel decrease in interest rates has shifted to a neutral nii position compared to march our us dollar nii benefit to higher rates has increased due to lower deposit betas and lower prepayments in the investment portfolio compared to march our us dollar nii sensitivity to lower rates has improved driven by changes to the composition of us deposits and cash flow hedging activity which impacts our shortend sensitivities our us declining rate scenarios are also impacted by assumed floors as us interest rates approach zero nii sensitivity is still positioned to benefit from changes in nonus interest rates with the majority of our sensitivity derived from the shortend of the curve given deposit pricing expectations compared to march our nonus benefit to higher rates has decreased while the benefit to lower rates has increased the decreased benefit to higher rates is driven by emea deposit pricing actions in addition to the treatment of excess reserves by the european central bank and swiss national bank the increased benefit to lower rates is impacted by the aforementioned deposit pricing and excess reserve changes state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations eve sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of interest rate shocks over a longterm horizon in the following table we report our eve sensitivity to bps instantaneous rate shocks relative to spot interest rates management compares the change in eve sensitivity against our aggregate tier and tier riskbased

march eve sensitivity remains exposed to upward shifts in interest rates compared to march the change in the up bps instantaneous shock scenario was primarily driven by the benefit from increased liability duration from deposit modeling updates and longterm debt issuances the down bps instantaneous shock results are impacted by assumed floors as interest rates in several currencies approach zero which prevents the full extent of the rate shock to be realized both nii sensitivity and eve sensitivity are routinely monitored as market conditions change for additional information about our

compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives we assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements as well as our own internal capital goals targets and other relevant metrics our designation as a gsib is based on a number of factors as evaluated by banking regulators and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the basel iii rule further like all other us gsibs we are also currently subject to a leverage buffer under the basel iii rule if we fail to exceed any regulatory buffer or surcharge we will be subject to increased restrictions depending upon the extent of the shortfall regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same

by regulation y and the prompt corrective action framework the basel iii rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy the standardized approach and the advanced approaches applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations like us the standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk rwa including specified risk weights for certain on and offbalance sheet exposures the advanced approaches consist of the advanced internal ratingsbased approach used for the calculation of rwa related to credit risk and the advanced measurement approach used for the calculation of rwa related to operational risk the specific calculation of our and state street banks riskbased capital ratios changed as the provisions of the basel iii rule related to the numerator capital and denominator rwa were phased in and as our rwa calculated using the advanced approaches changed due to changes in methodology these methodological changes result in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of applicable changes to our capital base our asset composition our offbalance sheet exposures or

these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators and our advanced systems may not individually or collectively precisely represent or calculate the scenarios circumstances outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval for example a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution even if we do not experience a related loss could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event its characterization among the seven baseldefined unit of measure uom and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event or the timing of such effects on our results of operations due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems whether resulting from changes in data inputs regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the basel iii rule will change and may be volatile over time and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period the full effects of the

operations regulatory developments in april the federal reserve issued a proposed rule which would replace the current supplementary leverage ratio buffer for gsibs with a buffer equal to of their gsib surcharge which is currently for us this proposal would also make conforming modifications to our tlac and eligible ltd requirements applicable to gsibs in november the federal reserve and the other us federal banking agencies adopted a final rule that establishes a deduction for central bank deposits from a custodial banking organizations total leverage exposure equal to the lesser of i the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and ii the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts the rule became effective on april for the quarter ended march we estimated that billion of average

been as of march 2020the tlac and ltd that we are required to hold as calculated under the current requirements will also be reduced as a consequence of the rule also in november the federal reserve

statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies by their nature require management to make judgments involving significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions the more significant accounting policies applied by us have been identified by management as those associated with recurring fair value measurements impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies and allowance for credit losses these accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available an understanding of the judgments estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition allowance for credit losses in january we adopted asc which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology we maintain an allowance for credit losses to support our onbalance sheet credit exposures including financial assets held at amortized cost and investment securities held tomaturity we also maintain an allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our offbalance credit exposure the two components together represent the allowance for credit losses determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods we estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset while factoring in prepayment activity where supported by data over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period we utilize a baseline upside and downside scenario which are applied based on a probability weighting in order to better reflect managements expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment the multiple scenarios are based on a three year horizon or less depending on contractual maturity and then revert linearly over a two year period to a tenyear historical average thereafter the contractual term excludes expected extensions renewals and modifications but includes prepayment assumptions where applicable additional information about our allowance for credit losses is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10q for

standards that were adopted in the first quarter of in january we adopted asu financial instruments credit losses asc measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which replaces the incurred

offbalance sheet commitments including trade and other receivables loans and commitments heldtomaturity debt securities and other financial assets held at amortized cost at the reporting date to be measured based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts credit losses on availableforsale securities are recorded as an allowance against the amortized cost basis of the security limited to the amount by which the securitys amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value and reversal of impairment losses are allowed when the credit of the issuer improves asc was adopted using a modified retrospective method of transition for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off balance sheet commitments which requires the impact of applying the standard on prior periods to be reflected in opening retained earnings upon adoption results for reporting periods beginning after january are presented under the cecl methodology in asc while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable gaap additional information about the reporting for prior periods can be found in our form 10k filed with the sec on february

refer to note for additional information an afs security is impaired when the current fair value of an individual security is below its amortized cost basis an allowance for credit losses on impaired afs securities is recorded when the present value of expected future cash flows of the investment security is less than its amortized cost basis limited to the amount by which the securitys amortized

flows from nonus mortgage and asset backed securities our review of impaired afs investment securities generally includes the identification and evaluation of securities that have indications of potential impairment such as issuerspecific concerns including deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy the analysis of expected future cash flows of securities based on quantitative and qualitative factors the analysis of the collectability of those future cash flows including information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the analysis of the underlying collateral for mbs and abs the analysis of individual impaired securities including the anticipated recovery period and the magnitude of the overall price decline evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual securities to be deemed impaired and those that would not support impairment and documentation of the results of these analyses substantially all of our investment securities portfolio is composed of debt securities a critical component of our assessment of impairment of these debt securities is the identification of creditimpaired securities for which management does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security debt securities that are not deemed to be creditimpaired are subject to additional management analysis to assess whether management intends to sell or more likely than not would be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of its amortized cost basis with respect to certain classes of debt securities primarily us treasuries and agency securities mainly issued by us government entities and agencies as well as g7 sovereigns the bank considers the history of credit losses current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts which may indicate that the expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is or continues to be zero even if the us government were to technically default therefore for those securities the bank does not record expected credit losses please refer to note for additional discussion of the credit quality indicators and the factors utilized when assessing the htm and afs investment securities for impairment after a review of the investment portfolio taking into consideration current economic conditions adverse situations that might affect our ability to fully collect principal and interest the timing of future payments the credit quality and performance of the collateral underlying mbs and abs and other

and billion respectively as of march and december we had no loans on nonaccrual status as of march we had one loan with interest past due days or more as of december we had no loans days or more contractually past due in certain circumstances we restructure troubled loans by granting concessions to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty once restructured the loans are generally considered impaired until their maturity regardless of whether the borrowers perform under the modified terms of the loans there were no loans modified in troubled debt restructurings as of both march and december we review loans for indicators of impairment loans where indicators exist are evaluated individually for impairment at least quarterly for those loans where no such indicators are identified the loans are collectively evaluated for impairment as of march we had two loans for million in the commercial and financial segment that were individually evaluated for impairment and deemed to be impaired we recorded specific reserves of million on these loans as of december we had one loan for million in the commercial and financial segment that was individually evaluated for impairment and deemed to be impaired we recorded a specific reserve of million on that loan loans are reviewed on a regular basis and any provisions for credit losses that are recorded reflect managements estimate of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered appropriate to absorb estimated expected losses in the loan portfolio note allowance for credit losses we recognize an allowance for credit losses in accordance with asc for financial assets held at amortized cost afs securities and offbalance sheet commitments further discussion of our adoption of asc on january including the impact on our consolidated financial statements is provided in note when the allowance is recorded a provision for credit losses expense is recognized in net income the allowance for credit losses for financial assets represents the portion of the amortized cost basis including accrued interest for financial assets held at amortized cost which management does not expect to recover due to expected credit losses and is presented on the statement of condition as an offset to the amortized cost basis the accrued interest balance is presented separately on the statement of condition within accrued interest and fees receivable the allowance for offbalance sheet commitments is presented within other liabilities we have elected to not record an allowance on accrued interest for htm and afs securities accrued interest on these securities is reversed against interest income when payment on a security is delinquent for greater than days from the date of payment the allowance for credit losses may be determined using various methods including discounted cash flow methods lossrate methods probabilityofdefault methods or other methods as determined by us the method used to estimate expected credit losses may vary depending on the type of financial asset our ability to predict the timing of cash flows and the information available to us we estimate our expected credit losses using the probabilityofdefault method for the majority of our financial assets and the discounted cash flow method for our structured products portfolio which are state street corporation state street corporation condensed notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited included in investment securities heldtomaturity on the statement of condition we measure expected credit losses of financial assets on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristic exist each reporting period we assess whether the assets in the pool continue to display similar risk characteristics for a financial asset that does not share risk characteristics with other assets expected credit losses are measured based on net realizable value that is the difference between the discounted value of the expected future cash flows utilizing the effective interest rate and the amortized cost basis of the asset when the asset is collateral dependent that is when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the asset and the fair value of the collateral adjusted for the estimated costs to sell determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods we estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset while factoring in prepayment activity where supported by data over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period we utilize a baseline upside and downside scenario which are applied based on a probability weighting in order to better reflect managements expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment the multiple scenarios are based on a three year horizon or less depending on contractual maturity and then revert linearly over a two year period to a tenyear historical average thereafter the contractual term excludes expected extensions renewals and modifications but includes prepayment assumptions where applicable loans we segregate our portfolio of loans held for investment into two portfolio segments the commercial and financing and commercial real estate loan portfolio segment these two segments are further disaggregated into loan classes the level at which we monitor and assess credit risk based on risk characteristics we further classify commercial and financing loans as loans to investment funds senior secured bank loans also referred to as leveraged loans loans to municipalities and other these classifications reflect their risk characteristics their initial measurement attributes and the methods we use to monitor and assess credit risk please refer to note for additional discussion of the loan portfolio securities htm and afs investment securities are assessed for credit loss based on the security type discussed in note we monitor the credit quality of the htm and afs investment securities through the use of credit ratings on a quarterly basis as of march of our htm and afs investment portfolio is considered investment grade other assets the remainder of our financial assets held at amortized cost are disaggregated based on product type we assess credit risk based on the entire balance within fees receivable securities purchased under a resale agreement and securitiesfinancing within our principal business utilized the collateral maintenance provisions included within asu financial instruments credit losses asc measurement of credit losses on financial instruments an allowance for credit losses is recognized for any remaining exposure based on counterparty type offbalance sheet credit exposure the allowance for credit losses for offbalance sheet credit exposures recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition represents managements estimate of credit losses primarily in outstanding letters and lines of credit and other creditenhancement facilities provided to our clients and outstanding as of the balance sheet date the allowance is evaluated quarterly by management factors considered in evaluating the appropriate level of this allowance are similar to those considered with respect to the allowance for credit losses on financial assets held at amortized cost provisions to maintain the allowance at a level considered by us to be appropriate to absorb estimated credit losses in outstanding facilities are recorded in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statement of income credit quality credit quality for financial assets held at amortized cost are continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses as reported in our consolidated statement of condition is adjusted by provision for credit losses which is reported in earnings and reduced by the chargeoff of principal amounts net of recoveries we use an internal riskrating system to assess our risk of credit loss for each financial asset the riskrating process incorporates the use of riskrating tools in conjunction with management judgment qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a systematic manner and following a formal review and approval process an internal credit rating based on our credit scale is assigned state street corporation state street corporation condensed notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited when computing allowance levels credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes asset pools based on loss history delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods evaluations of the overall asset portfolio in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods credit quality is assessed and monitored at least annually by evaluating various attributes in order to enable the earliest possible detection of any concerns with the customers credit rating the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and transactions with counterparties and in our process for estimation of expected credit losses in assessing the risk rating assigned to each financial asset held at amortized cost among the factors considered are the borrowers debt capacity collateral coverage payment history and delinquency experience financial flexibility and earnings strength the expected amounts and source of repayment the level and nature of contingencies if any and the industry and geography in which the borrower operates these factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information and involve subjective assessment and interpretation credit counterparties are evaluated and riskrated on an individual basis at least annually management regularly reviews financial assets in the portfolio to assess credit quality indicators and to determine appropriate loans classification and grading in accordance with applicable bank regulations our internal risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings ranging from investment grade speculative special mention substandard doubtful and loss investment grade assets consisting of counterparties with strong credit quality and low expected credit risk and probability of default ratings apply to counterparties with a strong capacity to support the timely repayment of any financial commitment approximately of our loans were rated as investment grade as of march with external

governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations both pending and threatened these matters if resolved adversely against us or settled may result in monetary awards or payments fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices the resolution or settlement of these matters is inherently difficult to predict based on our assessment of these pending matters we do not believe that the amount of any judgment settlement or other action arising from any pending matter is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition however an adverse outcome or development in certain of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which such matter is resolved or an accrual is determined to be required on our consolidated financial condition or on our reputation we evaluate our needs for accruals of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings on a casebycase basis when we have a liability that we deem probable and we deem the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated as of the date of our consolidated financial statements we accrue our estimate of the amount of loss we also consider a loss probable and establish an accrual when we make or intend to make an offer of settlement once established an accrual is subject to subsequent adjustment as a result of additional information the resolution of legal and regulatory proceedings and the amount of reasonably estimable loss or range thereof are inherently difficult to predict especially in the early stages of proceedings even if a loss is probable an amount or range of loss might not be reasonably estimated until the later stages of the proceeding due to many factors such as the presence of complex or novel legal theories the discretion of governmental authorities in seeking sanctions or negotiating resolutions in civil and criminal matters the pace and state street corporation state street corporation condensed notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited timing of discovery and other assessments of facts and the procedural posture of the matter collectively factors influencing reasonable estimates as of march our aggregate accruals for loss contingencies for legal regulatory and related matters totaled approximately million including potential fines by government agencies and civil litigation with respect to the matters specifically discussed below to the extent that we have established accruals in our consolidated statement of condition for probable loss contingencies such accruals may not be sufficient to cover our ultimate financial exposure associated with any settlements or judgments any such ultimate financial exposure or proceedings to which we may become subject in the future could have a material adverse effect on our businesses on our future consolidated financial statements or on our reputation as of march for those matters for which we have accrued probable loss contingencies including the invoicing matter described below and for other matters for which loss is reasonably possible but not probable in future periods and for which we are able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss our estimate of the aggregate reasonably possible loss in excess of any accrued amounts ranges up to approximately million our estimate with respect to the aggregate reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties which may change quickly and significantly from time to time particularly if and as we engage with applicable governmental agencies or plaintiffs in connection with a proceeding also the matters underlying the reasonably possible loss will change from time to time as a result actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate in certain pending matters it is not currently feasible to reasonably estimate the amount or a range of reasonably possible loss and such losses which may be significant are not included in the estimate of reasonably possible loss discussed above this is due to among other factors the factors influencing reasonable estimates described above an adverse outcome in one or more of the matters for which we have not estimated the amount or a range of reasonably possible loss individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our businesses on our future consolidated financial statements or on our reputation given that our actual losses from any legal or regulatory proceeding for which we have provided an estimate of the reasonably possible loss could significantly exceed such estimate and given that we cannot estimate reasonably possible loss for all legal and regulatory proceedings as to which we may be subject now or in the future no conclusion as to our ultimate exposure from current pending or potential legal or regulatory proceedings should be drawn from the current estimate of reasonably possible loss the following discussion provides information with respect to significant legal governmental and regulatory matters invoicing matter in we determined that we had incorrectly invoiced clients for certain expenses we have reimbursed most of our affected customers for those expenses and we have implemented enhancements to our billing processes in connection with our enhancements to our billing processes we continue to review historical billing practices and may from time to time identify additional remediation in we identified an additional area of incorrect expense billing associated with mailing services in our retirement services business we currently expect the cumulative total of our payments to customers for these invoicing errors including the error in the retirement services business to be at least million all of which has been paid or is accrued however we may identify additional remediation costs in march a purported class action was commenced against us alleging that our invoicing practices violated duties owed to retirement plan customers under the employee retirement income security act in addition we have received a purported class action demand letter alleging that our invoicing practices were unfair and deceptive under massachusetts law a class of customers or particular customers may assert that we have not paid to them all amounts incorrectly invoiced and may seek double or treble damages under massachusetts law we are also cooperating with investigations by governmental and regulatory authorities on these matters including the civil and criminal divisions of the doj and the dol which reviews could result in significant fines or other sanctions civil and criminal against us in june we reached an agreement with the sec to settle its claims that we violated the recordkeeping provisions of section 34b of the investment company act of and caused violations of section 31a of the investment company act and rules 1a and 1b thereunder in connection with our overcharges of customers which are registered investment companies in reaching this settlement we neither admitted nor denied the claims contained in the secs order and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of million also in june we reached an agreement with the massachusetts attorney generals office to resolve its claims related to this matter in reaching this settlement we neither admitted nor denied the claims in the order and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of million the costs associated with these settlements were within our related previously established accruals for loss contingencies state street corporation state street corporation condensed notes to consolidated financial statements unaudited the sec and massachusetts attorney generals office settlements both recognize that the payment of million in disgorgement and interest is satisfied by our direct reimbursements of our customers in january the doj outlined a framework for a possible resolution of their review we are discussing the terms of a potential settlement of this matter with the doj separately we have inquired of the dol as to the status of their review but have not entered into settlement discussions with the dol there can be no assurance that any settlement with the doj or dol will be reached on financial or other terms acceptable to us or at all the aggregate amount of penalties that may potentially be imposed upon us in connection with the resolution of all outstanding investigations into our historical billing practices is not currently known we have established a legal accrual with respect to the pending governmental investigations and civil litigation with respect to this matter however our ultimate liability with respect to this matter might be significantly in excess of
