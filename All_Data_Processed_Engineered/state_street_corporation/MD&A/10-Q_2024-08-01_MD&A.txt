services accounting reporting and administration which we refer to collectively as back office and middle office services the nature and mix of services provided and the asset classes for which the services are performed affect our servicing fees the basis for fees will differ across regions and clients generally our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors including changes in market valuations client activity and asset flows net new business and the manner in which we price our services for servicing fees for which we have not yet issued an invoice to our clients as of period end we include an estimate of the impact of changes in market valuations client activity and flows net new business and changes in pricing in our revenues changes in market valuations our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our auca increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our auc a and servicing fee revenues though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our clients portfolios for certain asset classes where the valuation process is more complex including alternative investments or where our valuation is dependent on third party information auca is reported on a time lag typically onemonth for those asset classes the impact of market levels on our reported auca does not reflect current periodend market levels over the five years ended december we estimate that worldwide equity and fixed income market valuations impacted our servicing fees revenue by approximately on average with a range of to annually and approximately and in and respectively the impact of changes in worldwide fixed income markets

quarterend equity indices for selected indices while the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented in addition our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented assuming that all other factors remain constant including client activity asset flows and pricing we estimate using relevant information as of june that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations on a weighted average basis over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues on average and over multiple quarters of approximately we estimate similarly assuming all other factors remain constant and using relevant information as of june that changes in worldwide fixed income markets which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets have a smaller corresponding impact on our servicing

clientrelated activities our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested based on their market outlook risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations over the five years

condition and results of operations state street corporation net new business over the five years ended december net new business which includes business both won and lost has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately on average with a range of to annually and approximately in both and gross investment servicing mandates were billion and billion of auca in the three and six months ended june respectively and trillion of auca per year on average over the five years ended december ranging from approximately trillion to trillion of auca annually in any given year servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided the time required to install the assets and the types of assets installed revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed our installation timeline in general can range from to months with the average installation timeline being approximately to months over the past years we expect that our more complex installations including new state street alpha mandates will generally be on the longer end of the to months range with respect to the current asset mandates of approximately trillion of auca that are yet to be installed as of june we expect the conversion will occur over the coming months with approximately expected to be installed in the remainder of with the balance expected to be installed throughout and the expected timing of these installations is subject to change due to a variety of factors including adjusted implementation schedules agreed with clients scope adjustments and product and functionality changes pricing the industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today consequently no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins as the amount of revenue associated with auca once installed can vary materially on average over the five years ended december we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately annually with the impact ranging from to in any given year and approximately in both and pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us such as extending the term of our relationship with the client expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide the timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services and the amount of revenue generated may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services or process changes the nature of those services and client investment practices and other factors these same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients historically and based on an indicative sample of revenue we estimate that approximately on average of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of auca another approximately on average of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve and the remaining approximately of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values based on the impact of the above client activity and asset flows net new business and pricing noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients the full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur particularly in periods of higher volatility managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations state street corporation table

totaled approximately billion of auca servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately trillion as of june which will be reflected in auca in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods the full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period new asset servicing mandates including alpha servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements consents or assignments approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals new asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose these excluded assets which from time to time may be significant will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis based on factors present on or about the time we determine the business to be won by us and are not updated based on subsequent developments including changes in assets market valuations scope and potentially termination such assets therefore do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us which from time to time may be significant with respect to these new servicing mandates once installed we may provide various services including back office services such as custody and safekeeping transaction processing and trade settlement fund administration reporting and record keeping security servicing fund accounting middle office services such as investment book of records transaction management loans cash derivatives and collateral services recordkeeping client reporting and investment analytics markets services such as fx trading services liquidity solutions currency and collateral management and securities finance and front office services such as portfolio management solutions risk analytics scenario analysis performance and attribution trade order and execution management pretrade compliance and esg investment tools revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided the timing of installation and the types of assets as previously disclosed in early due to a decision to diversify providers one of our large asset servicing clients is moving a significant portion of its etf assets currently with state street to one or more other providers prior to the commencement of the transition of assets which began in we estimated that the financial impact of this transition represented approximately of our total fee revenue we began to see the impact of the transition on our fee revenue and income growth trends primarily towards the end of with the remainder expected to be realized through as the transition continues on a quarterly run rate basis we estimate that the second quarter of reflected approximately twothirds of the revenue impact of the exiting business we expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after this transition and for the client to continue to be meaningful to our business managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations state street corporation management fee revenue management fees increased in both the three and six months ended june compared to the same periods of as higher average market levels and net inflows from prior periods were partially offset by the impacts of a strategic etf repricing initiative management fees generated outside the us were approximately of total management fees in both the three and six months ended june and of total management fees in both the three and six months ended june management fees generally are affected by our level of aum which we report based on monthend valuations management fees for certain components of managed assets such as etfs mutual funds and undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities are affected by daily average valuations of aum management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided and the associated management fees earned are dependent on equity and fixedincome security valuations additional factors such as the relative mix of assets managed may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of aum and the investment strategies employed management fees may reflect other factors including performance fee arrangements as well as our relationship pricing for clients assetbased management fees for passively managed products to which our aum is currently primarily weighted are generally charged at a lower fee on aum than for actively managed products actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable accounts performance in light of the above we estimate using relevant information as of june and assuming that all other factors remain constant including the impact of business won and lost and client flows that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations on a weighted average basis over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues on average and over multiple quarters of approximately and changes in worldwide fixed income markets which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets will have a significantly smaller corresponding impact on our management fee revenues on average and over time daily averages monthend averages and quarterend indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue quarterend indices affect the values of aum as of those dates see table daily averages monthend averages and quarterend equity indices for selected indices while the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends the asset types and classes

principal marketmaker through both direct sales and trading and indirect fx trading direct sales and trading represent fx transactions at negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly clients are able to choose their own execution time and method trading by voice or electronically on one of the several available multibank platforms these principal

with clients for which we are the funds custodian or their investment managers routed to our fx desk through our assetservicing operation we execute indirect fx trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients indirect fx is designed to address fx trades that relate to the purchase sale or holding of a security where clients chose their execution frequency either hourly or once per day allowing us to offer straightthrough processing and a fully automated service our fx trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors including the volume and type of client fx transactions and related spreads currency volatility reflecting market conditions and our management of exchange rate interest rate and other market risks associated with our fx activities the relative impact of these factors on our total fx trading revenues often differs from period to period for example assuming all other factors remain constant increases or decreases in volumes or bidoffer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases as the case may be in clientrelated fx revenue our clients that utilize indirect fx trading can in addition to executing their fx transactions through dealers not affiliated with us transition from indirect fx trading to either direct sales and trading execution including our street fx service or to one of our electronic trading platforms street fx

as the agency lending funds and security lending transactions which we enter into as principal which we refer to as our prime services business securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to noncash collateral is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our share of the fee split as principal our prime services business borrows securities from the lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower either our client or a broker dealer we act as principal when the lending client is unable to or elects not to transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities in our role as principal we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating while we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance and as a result our revenue from and the profitability of our securities lending activities in future periods in addition the constantly evolving regulatory environment including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards interpretations of those standards and our own balance sheet management

related arrangement where the customer does not take possession of the software is recognized over the term of the contract as services are provided upon renewal of a saas arrangement revenue continues to be recognized as services are provided under the new contract as a result of these differences in how portions of crd revenue are accounted for crd revenue may vary more than other

wholesale funding and longterm debt interestbearing deposits with banks averaged billion and billion in the three and six months ended june respectively compared to billion and billion in the same

reflect higher levels of client deposits and funding levels securities purchased under resale agreements averaged billion and billion in the three and six months ended june respectively compared to billion and billion in the same periods of respectively due to a shift to term repurchase agreements which reduces our ability to net against resale agreement balances additionally as a member of ficc

criteria are met the impact of balance sheet netting was billion and billion on average in the three and six months ended june respectively compared to billion and billion in the same periods of

clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with ficc backed by our guarantee to ficc of the prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients respective obligations we generally obtain a security interest from our sponsored clients in the high quality securities collateral that they receive which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to ficc additionally as a member of certain industry clearing and settlement exchanges we may be required to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization and provide liquidity support in the event of the default of another member to the extent that the defaulting members clearing fund obligation and the prescribed loss allocation to ficc is depleted it is difficult to estimate our maximum possible

securities finance fee revenue as well as net interest income average total interestbearing deposits increased to billion and billion in the three and six months ended june respectively from billion and billion in the same periods of respectively the increase is driven by active engagement with our clients on deposit raising initiatives rotation from noninterest bearing deposits and a reduction in the federal reserves overnight repurchase agreement activity future interestbearing deposit levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business client behavior the mix of interestbearing and noninterest bearing deposits and market conditions including the general levels of us and nonus interest rates average other shortterm borrowings increased to billion and billion in the three and six months ended june respectively from billion and billion in the same periods of respectively due to increased wholesale funding the increase is driven by our effort to diversify

industrys ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk the lcr measures an institutions hqla against its net cash outflows hqla primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the lcr rule net cash outflows are measured as prescribed under the lcr rule which provides a significant benefit for deposits classified as operational we report the lcr to the federal reserve daily for both quarters ended june and december average daily lcr for the parent company was the impact of higher deposits on the parent companys lcr is limited by a cap known as the transferability restriction on the hqla from state street bank that can be recognized at the parent company as defined in the us lcr final rule this restriction limits the hqla used in the calculation of the parent companys lcr to the amount of net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary state street bank the average hqla postprescribed haircuts for the parent company under the lcr final rule definition was billion for the quarter ended june compared to billion for the quarter ended december primarily due to an increase in client deposits relative to the prior period for the quarter ended june the lcr for state street bank was approximately in addition we are subject to the final rule issued by the us banking agencies implementing the basel committee on banking supervisions bcbss nsfr in the us which became effective on july the final rule requires large banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding which is a weighted measure of a companys funding sources over a oneyear time horizon calculated by applying standardized weightings to the companys equity and liabilities based on their expected stability the amount of stable funding can be no less than the amount of required stable funding which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics as a us gsib we are required to maintain an nsfr that is equal to or greater than pursuant to the bcbss nsfr final rule as a subsidiary of a us gsib state street bank is similarly required to maintain an nsfr that is equal to or greater than as of june both the parent companys and state street banks nsfr was above the minimum nsfr requirement the average nsfr for the parent company was for both the second and first quarters of we maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the federal reserve the ecb and other nonus central banks of approximately billion for the quarter ended june compared to billion for the quarter ended december the higher levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect higher levels of client deposits liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the federal reserve bank of boston frbb the fhlb and other nonus central banks state street bank is a member of the fhlb this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against highquality collateral which helps facilitate assetandliability management access to primary intraday and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations state street corporation underlying conditions as of june we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the frbb discount window billion outstanding of bank term funding program and billion outstanding of fhlb funding as of december we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the frbb discount window billion outstanding of bank term funding program and billion outstanding borrowings from the fhlb these outstanding borrowings have initial maturities of twelve months and are recorded in other shortterm borrowings in the consolidated statement of condition in addition to the investment securities included in our asset liquidity we have other unencumbered investment securities and certain loans that we can pledge as collateral to access these various facilities these additional assets are available sources of liquidity although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our lcr asset liquidity the average fair value of total unencumbered securities was billion for the quarter ended june compared to billion for the quarter ended december uses of liquidity significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following withdrawals of client deposits drawdowns by our custody clients of lines of credit advances to clients to settle securities transactions increases in our investment and loan portfolios or other permitted purposes such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings a recurring use of our liquidity involves our deployment of hqla from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our prime services program we had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling billion and billion and standby letters of credit totaling billion and billion as of june and december respectively these amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral as of june approximately of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and of our standby letters of credit expire within one year since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements recovery and resolution planning under section 165d of the doddfrank act we are required to submit a resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the federal reserve and the fdic the agencies the purpose of our resolution plan is to describe our preferred resolution strategy and to demonstrate that we have the resources and capabilities to execute on that strategy in the event of major financial distress through resolution planning we seek to maintain our role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system while minimizing risk to the financial system the final rule published on november requires us gsibs to file a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan on an alternating basis in the relevant submission years we submitted the 165d resolution plan as required by july feedback letters from the agencies on the results of the plan submissions were released to each of the us gsibs on june we have no identified shortcomings or deficiencies our next 165d resolution plan submission to the agencies is due by july in the event of material financial distress our preferred resolution strategy is the spoe strategy the spoe strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the parent company and pursuant to a support agreement among the parent company ssif a direct subsidiary of the parent company our beneficiary entities as defined below and certain of our other entities ssif is obligated up to its available resources to recapitalize andor provide liquidity to state street bank and the other entities benefiting from such capital andor liquidity support collectively with state street bank beneficiary entities in amounts designed to prevent the beneficiary entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings following the recapitalization of or provision of liquidity to the beneficiary entities the parent company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the us bankruptcy code the beneficiary entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the parent companys claimants under the support agreement the parent company has prefunded ssif by contributing certain of its assets primarily its liquid assets cash deposits investments in intercompany debt investments in marketable securities and other cash and noncash equivalent investments to ssif at the time it entered into the support agreement and continues to contribute such assets to the extent available on an ongoing basis in consideration for these contributions ssif has agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the parent company and all of the beneficiary entities in accordance with the parent companys capital and liquidity policies under the support agreement the parent company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif has provided the parent company with a committed credit line and issued managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations state street corporation and may issue one or more promissory notes to the parent company the parent company funding notes that together are intended to allow the parent company to continue to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a recapitalization event which is defined under the support agreement as the earlier occurrence of one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or the authorization by the parent companys board of directors for the parent company to commence bankruptcy proceedings the support agreement does not obligate ssif to maintain any specific level of resources and ssif may not have sufficient resources to implement the spoe strategy in the event a recapitalization event occurs the obligations outstanding under the parent company funding notes would automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to ssif the obligations of the parent company and ssif under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the parent company and ssif would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the beneficiary entities ssif is a distinct legal entity separate from the parent company and the parent companys other affiliates in accordance with our policies we are required to monitor on an ongoing basis the capital and liquidity needs of state street bank and our other beneficiary entities to support this process we have established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur the trigger thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support that results in us emerging from resolution as a stabilized institution with market confidence restored upon the occurrence of a recapitalization event ssif would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the parent company the parent company would be required to contribute to ssif any remaining assets it is required to contribute to ssif under the support agreement which specifically exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the beneficiary entities to support such entities continued operation to the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement and the parent company would be expected to commence chapter proceedings under the us bankruptcy code no person or entity other than a party to the support agreement should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a beneficiary entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditors perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities state street bank is also required to submit periodically to the fdic a plan for resolution in the event of its failure referred to as an idi plan we submitted our last idi plan by december in alignment with changes to the idi plan requirements as set out in the june policy statement issued by the fdic following the notice of proposed rule making from august the fdic finalized the idi rule in june the updated rule becomes effective on october the final rule will require us gsibs to file their covered insured depository institution plans on a biennial basis with the expectation that the fdic will communicate directly with the banks on their first submission date additionally we are required to submit a recovery plan periodically to the federal reserve this plan includes strategies designed to respond to stress factors at an early stage and stabilize and maintain operational continuity and market confidence our recovery strategies are intended to be implemented before our resolution plan is triggered we are also engaged in recovery planning requirements in certain international jurisdictions where we operate funding deposits we provide products and services including custody accounting administration daily pricing fx services cash management financial asset management securities finance and investment advisory services as a provider of these products and services we generate client deposits which have generally provided a stable lowcost source of funds as a global custodian clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies as of both june and december approximately of our average total deposit balances were denominated in us dollars in eur in gbp and in all other currencies shortterm funding our onbalance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets but more importantly they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales in addition our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors as discussed earlier under asset liquidity state street managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations state street corporation banks membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against highquality collateral shortterm secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase these transactions are shortterm in nature generally overnight and are collateralized by highquality investment securities these balances were billion and billion as of june and december respectively state street bank continues to maintain a line of credit with a financial institution of cad billion or approximately billion as of june to support its canadian securities processing operations the line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancellable by either party with prior notice as of both june and december there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit longterm funding we have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business needs on march we issued billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes due agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by major credit rating agencies factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings relative market position strong risk management strong capital ratios diverse liquidity sources including the global capital markets and client deposits strong liquidity monitoring procedures and preparedness for current or future regulatory developments high ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by providing confidence for unsecured funding and depositors increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products facilitating reduced collateral haircuts in secured lending transactions and engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings a downgrade or reduction in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets which could increase the related cost of funds in turn this could cause the sudden and largescale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients which could lead to drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by major rating agencies the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10q other funding sources such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements for which there

stated statistical confidence interval we use a risk measurement methodology to measure tradingrelated var daily we have adopted standards for measuring tradingrelated var and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements our regulatory varbased measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a twoyear observation period calibrated to a onetail confidence interval and a tenbusinessday holding period we calculate a stressed varbased measure using the same model we use to calculate var but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelvemonth periods that reflect significant financial stress the stressed var model is designed to identify the secondworst outcome occurring in the worst continuous oneyear rolling period since july this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling tenday period with an outcome that is worse than of other outcomes during that twelvemonth period of financial stress for each portfolio the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the oneyear time horizon that produces the largest tenbusinessday var from within the available historical data this historical data set includes the financial crisis of the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard poors downgrade of us treasury debt in august as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time future

committee frc limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units escalated as appropriate and reviewed by the frc if material in addition we have established several action triggers that prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan validation and backtesting we perform frequent backtesting to assess the accuracy of our varbased model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level this backtesting involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily actual profitandloss pl outcomes observed from daily market movements we backtest our var model using clean pl which excludes nontrading revenue such as fees commissions and nii as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves such as fees commissions changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday

provide sustainable nii under varying economic conditions while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates while many market factors affect the level of nii and the economic value of our assets and liabilities one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates most of our nii is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities as well as the currency composition of our significant nonus dollar denominated client deposits we quantify nii sensitivity using an earnings

management in our form 10k strategic risk management we define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions improper implementation of strategic initiatives or lack of responsiveness to industrywide changes strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment decline in market performance or changes in our business activities and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks not already captured as market interest rate credit operational model or liquidity risks we incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations state street corporation separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult for instance the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a strategic risk loss an additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a major acquisition failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk strategic risk is managed with a longterm focus techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans which are subject to review and challenge from senior management and the board of directors as well as a formal review and approval process for all new business and product proposals the potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision we use a combination of historical earnings volatility scenario analysis stresstesting and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk management and control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units with oversight from the control functions as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes capital managing our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives we assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements as well as our own internal capital goals targets and other relevant metrics our designation as a gsib is based on a number of factors as evaluated by banking regulators and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the basel iii final rule further like all other us gsibs we are also currently subject to a slr buffer in addition to the required minimum of under the basel iii final rule if we fail to exceed any regulatory buffer or surcharge we will be subject to increased restrictions depending upon the extent of the shortfall regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company and therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same capital liquidity and other regulatory requirements for additional information about our capital refer to pages to included under item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our form 10k regulatory capital we and state street bank as advanced approaches banking organizations are subject to the us basel iii framework we are also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by us banking regulators the basel iii rule provides two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy the standardized approach and the advanced approaches applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations like us the standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk rwa including specified risk weights for on and certain offbalance sheet exposures the advanced approaches consist of the advanced internal ratingsbased approach used for the calculation of credit risk rwa and the advanced measurement approach used for the calculation of operational risk rwa as required by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act enacted in we and state street bank as advanced approaches banking organizations are subject to a capital floor also referred to as the collins amendment in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy such that our riskbased capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced approaches and the standardized approach under the advanced approaches state street and state street bank are subject to a ccb requirement plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer requirement which is currently set at under the standardized approach state street bank is subject to the same ccb and countercyclical capital buffer requirements but for state street the ccb requirement is replaced by the scb requirement according to the scb rule issued in in addition state street is subject to a gsib surcharge the scb replaced under the standardized approach the ccb with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institutions starting and lowest projected cet1 ratio under the ccar severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments as a percentage of rwa from the fourth through seventh quarter of the ccar planning horizon the scb requirement can be no less than of rwa breaching the scb or other managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations state street corporation regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a banking organizations ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers our current scb requirement is for the period from october through september on june we were notified by the federal reserve of the results from the supervisory stress test our preliminary scb calculated under the supervisory stress test was well below the minimum resulting in an scb at that floor which will continue to remain in effect from october through september our minimum riskbased capital ratios as of january include a ccb of and a scb of for the advanced approaches and standardized approach respectively a gsib surcharge of and a countercyclical buffer of this results in minimum riskbased ratios of for the common equity tier cet1 capital ratio for the tier capital ratio and for the total capital ratio our current gsib surcharge through december is based upon calculations using data as of december our gsib surcharge will remain at through december to maintain the status of the parent company as a financial holding company we and our idi subsidiaries are required among other requirements to be well capitalized as defined by regulation y and regulation h the market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of var which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading positions defined by the rule as covered positions as well as stressedvar measures to supplement the var measures the rule also requires a public disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our related var and stressedvar measures the qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is provided under market risk management included in this managements discussion and analysis on july us banking agencies issued a proposed rule to implement the basel iii endgame basel iii endgame proposal for large banks and separately proposed revisions to the us gsib capital surcharge framework gsib surcharge proposal the basel iii endgame proposal would among other things eliminate the advanced approaches for riskbased capital adequacy in favor of a new standardized expanded riskbased approach that would include unlike the current standardized approach operational risk and cva risk rwa components and would also replace the existing market risk rule with the new fundamental review of the trading book frtb framework the gsib surcharge proposal would among other things measure the gsib surcharge in more granular increments as opposed to the increments that currently apply the basel iii endgame proposal would maintain the current basel iii rules dualrequirement structure whereby we and state street bank would be required to calculate our riskbased capital ratios under both the expanded riskbased approach and the standardized approach in addition the proposal would modify the existing standardized approach by requiring that the proposed new market risk standards frtb also be applied in the standardized approach the basel iii endgame proposal would apply the scb and gsib surcharge to the riskbased capital requirements calculated under both the expanded riskbased approach and the existing standardized approach the basel iii endgame proposal includes an effective date of july with a threeyear transition arrangement until the requirements are fully phased in on july the gsib surcharge proposal is set to be implemented two calendar quarters after the date of the adoption of the final rule which is currently to be determined based on our current understanding of the basel iii endgame proposal we estimate that if the expanded riskbased approach had been applied on a fully phasedin basis as of december and in the absence of taking any actions to mitigate its impact our expanded riskbased approach rwa as of that date would have been approximately higher than our actual standardized approach rwa as of that date any estimate of how the expanded riskbased approach may impact us is subject to uncertainty as actual results may differ from the anticipated results and may be materially affected by and dependent on a range of factors including business performance future capital actions the results of future supervisory stress tests and interpretations including changes in interpretations of

advanced approaches and standardized approach in conformity with the basel iii final rule the advanced approachesbased ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of june based on our internal and external data quantitative formulae statistical models historical correlations and assumptions collectively referred to as advanced systems in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on form 10q or an annual report on form 10k significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators and our advanced systems may not individually or collectively precisely represent or calculate the scenarios circumstances outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval for example a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution even if we do not experience a related loss could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event its characterization among the seven baseldefined uom and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event or the timing of such effects on our results of operations due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems whether resulting from changes in data inputs regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the basel iii final rule will change and may be volatile over time and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period the full effects of the basel iii final rule on us and state street bank are

matters in march following the closures of silicon valley bank svb and signature bank and the appointment of the fdic as the receiver for those banks the fdic announced that under the systemic risk exception set forth in the federal deposit insurance act fdia all insured and uninsured deposits of those banks were transferred to the respective bridge banks for svb and signature bank the fdic also announced that as required by the fdia any losses to the dif to support uninsured depositors would be recovered by a special assessment in november the fdic published in the federal register a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover the loss to the dif arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following the closure of svb and signature bank at that time the fdic determined that the total special assessment for those purposes was billion which is approximately equal to the fdics then current estimate of losses to the dif attributable to the protection of uninsured depositors at svb and signature bank in february and again in june the fdic disclosed that its estimate of those losses to the dif had increased the fdic will ultimately determine the exact amount of losses incurred when it terminates the receiverships of these two banks and the amount of the special assessment will be adjusted as the loss estimates change for idis such as state street bank the special assessment will be applied at a quarterly rate of basis points multiplied by the idis estimated uninsured deposits reported as of december and adjusted to exclude the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits from the idi the fdic will collect the special assessment over eight quarterly assessment periods although the collection period may change as a result of updates to the estimated loss subsequent to the original estimate pursuant to the systemic risk determination or if assessments collected change due to corrective amendments to the amount of uninsured deposits reported for the december reporting period the final rule was effective on april with the first collection for the special assessment reflected on the invoice for the first quarterly assessment period of ie january through march with a payment date of june in the fourth quarter of we recognized a pretax expense within other expenses of approximately million reflecting state street banks allocation of the special assessment at that time consistent with the calculation methodology noted above in the first quarter of we recognized an additional pretax expense within other expenses of approximately million primarily reflecting the fdics february disclosed increase to its estimate of losses to the dif the total expense for the special assessment remains subject to any actions by the fdic as
