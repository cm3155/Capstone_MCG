three and six months ended june respectively compared to in both the same periods in nm state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations servicing fee revenue servicing fee revenue comprises revenue from both back office and middle office services generally our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors including changes in market valuations client activity and asset flows net new business and the manner in which we price our services we provide a range of services to our clients including core custody services accounting reporting and administration which we refer to collectively as back office services and middle office services the nature and mix of services provided affects our servicing fees the basis for fees will differ across regions and clients changes in market valuations our servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our auca increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our auca and servicing fee revenues though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our clients portfolios for certain asset classes where the valuation process is more complex including alternative investments or where our valuation is dependent on third party information auca is reported on a lag typically onemonth for those asset classes the impact of market levels on our reported auca does not reflect current periodend market levels over the five years ended december we estimate that worldwide market valuations impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately on average with a range of to annually and approximately and in and respectively see table daily averages monthend averages and quarterend equity indices for selected indices while the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented in addition our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented assuming that all other factors remain constant including client activity asset flows and pricing we estimate using relevant information as of june that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations on a weighted average basis over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues on average and over multiple quarters of approximately we estimate similarly assuming all other factors remain constant and using relevant information as of june that changes in worldwide fixed income markets which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets have a significantly smaller impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time table daily averages monthend averages and quarterend equity indices daily averages of indices

impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients including fx settlements equity and derivative trades and wire transfer activity as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors including transaction volumes asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested as well as industry trends associated with these clientrelated activities our clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested based on their market outlook risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations over the five years ended december we estimate that client activity and asset flows together impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately on average with a range of to annually and approximately and in and respectively see table industry asset flows for selected asset flow information while the asset flows presented are indicative of

may sourced by morningstar net new business over the five years ended december net new business which includes business both won and lost has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately on average with a range of to annually and approximately and in and respectively gross new investment servicing mandates were billion in the second quarter of and trillion per year on average over the past five years over the five years ended december gross new annual investment servicing mandates ranged from billion to trillion servicing fee revenue associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided the time required to install the assets and the types of assets installed revenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed our installation timeline in general can range from to months with the average installation timeline being approximately to months over the past years our more complex installations including new state street alpha mandates will generally be on the longer end of that range with respect to the current asset mandates of approximately trillion that are yet to be installed as of june we expect the conversion will occur over the coming months state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pricing the industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today consequently no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins as the amount of revenue associated with auca can vary materially on average over the five years ended december we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately annually with the impact ranging from to in any given year and approximately in both and pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us such as extending the term of our relationship with the client expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide the timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services and the amount of revenue generated may differ from expectations due to the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services the nature of those services and client investment practices and other factors these same market pressures also impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients in order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds we estimate that we need at least trillion of new auca per year although notwithstanding increases in auca servicing fees remain subject to several factors including changes in market valuations client activity and asset flows the manner in which we price our services the nature of the assets being serviced and the type of services and the other factors described in this form 10q historically and based on an indicative sample of revenue we estimate that approximately on average of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of auca another on average of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve and the remaining approximately of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values based on the impact of the above client activity and asset flows net new business and pricing noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients the full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur particularly in periods of higher volatility servicing fees as presented in table total revenue decreased in the three months ended june compared to the same period in primarily due to lower average equity and fixed income market levels normal pricing headwinds lower client

condition and results of operations asset servicing mandates newly announced in the second quarter of totaled approximately billion servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately trillion as of june which will be reflected in auca in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods the full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period new asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals new asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter these excluded assets which from time to time may be significant will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us which may from time to time be significant with respect to these new servicing mandates once installed we may provide various services including back office services such as custody and safekeeping transaction processing and trade settlement fund administration reporting and record keeping security servicing fund accounting middle

such as fx trading services liquidity solutions currency and collateral management securities finance and front office services such as portfolio management solutions risk analytics scenario analysis performance and attribution trade order and execution management pretrade compliance and environmental social and governance esg investment tools revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided and the timing of installation and the types of assets as a result of a decision to diversify providers one of our large asset servicing clients has advised us it expects to move a significant portion of its etf assets currently with state street to one or more other providers pending necessary approvals we expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after this transition and for the client to continue to be meaningful to our business the transition is expected to begin in but will principally occur in and for the year ended december the fee revenue associated with the transitioning assets represented approximately of our total fee revenue the actual total revenue and income impact of this transition will reflect a range of factors including potential growth in our continuing business with the client and expense reductions associated with the transition management fee revenue management fees generally are affected by our level of aum which we report based on monthend valuations management fees for certain components of managed assets such as etfs mutual funds and undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities are affected by daily average valuations of aum management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided and the associated management fees earned are dependent on equity and fixedincome security valuations additional factors such as the relative mix of assets managed may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue while certain management fees are directly determined by the values of aum and the investment strategies employed management fees may reflect other factors including performance fee arrangements as well as our relationship pricing for clients from the second half of through the first quarter of we were in a prolonged lowinterest rate environment and waived certain fees for our clients for money market products following the federal reserve rate hikes in march money market fee waivers did not have a significant impact on our management fee revenue in the second quarter of and we do not expect them to materially impact subsequent quarters in assetbased management fees for passively managed products to which our aum is currently primarily weighted are generally charged at a lower fee on aum than for actively managed products actively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable accounts performance state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in light of the above we estimate using relevant information as of june and assuming that all other factors remain constant including the impact of business won and lost and client flows that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations on a weighted average basis over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues on average and over multiple quarters of approximately and changes in worldwide fixed income markets which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets will have a significantly smaller impact on our management fee revenues on average and over time daily averages monthend averages and yearend indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue yearend indices affect the values of aum as of those dates see table daily averages monthend averages and quarterend equity indices for selected indices while the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented in addition our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented management fees decreased in the three months ended june compared to same period in primarily due to lower average equity and

fund connect platform due to the impact of fee waivers by participating money market funds including state street global advisors funds we primarily earn fx trading revenue by acting as a principal marketmaker through both direct sales and trading and indirect fx trading direct sales and trading represent fx transactions at negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly these principal marketmaking activities include transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers as well as those funds under custody with us indirect fx trading represents fx transactions with clients for which we are the funds custodian or their investment managers routed to our fx desk through our assetservicing operation we execute indirect fx trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients our fx trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors including the volume and type of client fx transactions and related spreads currency volatility reflecting market conditions and our management of exchange rate interest rate and other market risks associated with our fx activities the relative impact of these factors on our total fx trading revenues often differs from period to period for example assuming all other factors remain constant increases or decreases in volumes or bidoffer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases as the case may be in clientrelated fx revenue our clients that utilize indirect fx trading can in addition to executing their fx transactions through dealers not affiliated with us transition from indirect fx trading to either direct sales and trading execution including our street fx service or to one of our electronic trading platforms street fx in which we continue to act as a principal marketmaker enables our clients to define their fx execution strategy and automate the fx trade execution process both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank we also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through electronic fx services and other trading transition management and brokerage revenue electronic fx services our clients may choose to execute fx transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms these transactions generate revenue through a click fee other trading transition management and brokerage revenue as our clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values they may choose to utilize our transition or currency management capabilities or transact with our equity trade execution group these transactions which are not limited to foreign exchange generate revenue via commissions charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios fund connect is another one of our electronic trading platforms it is a global trading analytics and cash management tool with access to more than money market funds from leading providers securities finance our securities finance business consists of three components an agency lending program for state street global advisors managed investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives which we refer to as the state street global advisors lending funds an agency lending program for thirdparty investment managers and asset owners which we refer to as the agency lending funds and security lending transactions which we enter into as principal which we refer to as our enhanced custody business securities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to noncash collateral is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our share of the fee split state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as principal our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower either our client or a brokerdealer we act as principal when the lending client is unable to or elects not to transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities in our role as principal we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating while we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower securities finance revenue as presented in table total revenue decreased in both the three and six months ended june compared to the same periods in primarily driven by lower agency and enhanced custody balances partially offset by higher spreads market influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance and as a result our revenue from and the profitability of our securities lending activities in future periods in addition the constantly evolving regulatory environment including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards interpretations of those standards and our own balance sheet management activities may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency lending or enhanced custody businesses the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods software and processing fees software and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue including fees from software licensing and maintenance and fees from our structured products business software and processing fees revenue presented in table total revenue decreased in the three months ended june compared to the same period in primarily driven by lower front office software and data revenue associated with crd software and processing fees

revenue which includes primarily revenue from crd alpha data platform and alpha data services decreased in the three months ended june compared to the same period in primarily driven by lower onpremises renewals and the absence of episodic fees partially offset by higher softwareenabled revenues front office software and data revenue increased in the six months ended june compared to the same period in primarily driven by higher softwareenabled and professional services revenue partially offset by lower onpremises renewals and absence of episodic fees revenue related to the front office solutions provided by crd is primarily driven by the sale of term software licenses and saas including professional services such as consulting and implementation services software support and maintenance approximately of revenue associated with a sale of software to be installed onpremises is recognized at a point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license with the percentage varying based on the length of the contract and other contractual terms the remainder of revenue for onpremise installations is recognized over the length of the contract as maintenance and other services are provided upon renewal of an onpremises software contract the same pattern of revenue recognition is followed with recognized upon renewal and the remaining balance recognized over the term of the contract revenue for a saas related arrangement where the customer does not take possession of the software is recognized over the term of the contract as services are provided upon renewal of a saas arrangement revenue continues to be recognized as services are provided under the new contract as a result of these differences in how portions of crd revenue are accounted for crd revenue may vary more than other business units quarter to quarter lending related and other fees which decreased by in both the three and six months ended june

billion and billion in the three and six months ended june respectively compared to billion and billion in the same periods in respectively these deposits primarily reflect our maintenance of cash

in respectively we maintain an agreement with fixed income clearing corporation ficc a clearing organization that enables us to net securities sold under repurchase agreements against those repurchased under resale agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization when specific netting criteria are met the impact of balance sheet netting increased to billion and billion in the three and six months ended june respectively compared to billion and billion in the same periods in respectively primarily driven by an increase in ficc repo volumes we have

including the volume and mix of client deposits and funding sources central bank actions balance sheet management activities changes in the level and slope of us and nonus interest rates revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards or interpretations of those standards the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured and changes in the type and amount of credit or other loans we extend based on market conditions and other factors including regulatory standards we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from paydowns and maturities of investment securities in highlyrated us and nonus securities such as federal agency mbs sovereign debt securities and us treasury and agency securities the pace at which we reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions the implementation of regulatory standards including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time we expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our reinvestment program and future levels of nii and nim provision for credit losses we recorded a

in the future be significant counterparties to us or whose financial instruments serve as collateral on which we rely for credit risk mitigation purposes and may do so again in the future as a result

management in the normal course of our global business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks some inherent in the financial services industry others more specific to our business activities our risk management framework focuses on material risks which include the following credit and counterparty risk liquidity risk funding and management operational risk information technology risk market risk associated with our trading activities market risk associated with our nontrading activities which we refer to as assetandliability management and which consists primarily of interest rate risk model risk strategic risk and reputational fiduciary and business conduct risk state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations many of these risks as well as certain of the factors underlying each of these risks that could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements are discussed in detail on pages to included under item risk factors in our form 10k for additional information about our risk management including our risk appetite framework and risk governance committee structure refer to pages to included under item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management in our form 10k credit risk management we define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty borrower or obligor collectively referred to as a counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms we assume credit risk in our traditional nontrading lending activities such as overdrafts loans and contingent commitments in our investment securities portfolio where recourse to a counterparty exists and in our direct and indirect trading activities such as securities purchased under a resale agreement principal securities lending and fx and indemnified agency securities lending we also assume credit risk in our daytoday treasury and securities and other settlement operations in the form of deposit placements and other cash balances with central banks or private sector institutions and fees receivables allowance for credit losses we maintain an allowance for credit losses to support certain onbalance sheet credit exposures including financial assets held at amortized cost we also maintain an allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our offbalance sheet credit exposure the two components together represent the allowance for credit losses review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year but occurs at least quarterly and is based among other factors on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio and the estimated effects of our forecasts on our counterparties we utilize multiple economic scenarios consisting of a baseline upside and downside scenarios to develop managements forecast of future expected losses in the second quarter of our allowance estimate reflected a downward shift in managements economic outlook partially offset by a decrease in expected losses resulting from a reduction in leveraged loan balances within our portfolio allowance estimates remain subject to continued model and economic uncertainty and management may use qualitative adjustments if future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of june or if credit risk migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent of the economic forecast our allowance for credit losses will also change additional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in notes and

appropriate riskrelated factors in managing liquidity risk we employ limits maintain established metrics and early warning indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs this process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets we manage our liquidity on a global consolidated basis we also manage liquidity on a standalone basis at our parent company as well as at certain branches and subsidiaries of state street bank state street bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks such as the federal funds market and the federal reserves discount window the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile reflecting narrower market access additionally the parent company typically holds or has direct access to primarily through ssif a direct subsidiary of the parent company and the support agreement as discussed in the uses of liquidity section of this managements discussion and analysis enough cash to meet its current debt maturities and cash needs as well as those projected over the next oneyear period reference our spoe strategy as discussed in the uses of liquidity section of this managements discussion and analysis absent financial distress at the parent company the liquid assets available at ssif continue to be available to the parent company as of june our parent company and state state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations street bank had approximately billion of senior notes or subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months as a systemically important financial institution our liquidity risk management activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements including interpretations of those requirements under specific us and international regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance supervisory activities such as stress tests resolution planning examinations and other regulatory interactions satisfaction of these requirements could in some cases result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio reduced nii or nim a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the way in which we deliver our products and services if we fail to meet regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators we could receive negative regulatory stress test results incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a noncredible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding our efforts to satisfy or our failure to satisfy these regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations for additional information on our liquidity risk management as well as liquidity metrics refer to pages to included under item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity risk management in our form 10k for additional information on our liquidity ratios including lcr and the net stable funding ratio refer to page included under item business in our form 10k asset liquidity central to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity which consists primarily of hqla hqla is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the lcr as a banking organization we are subject to a minimum lcr under the lcr rule approved by us banking regulators the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of internationally active banking organizations like us to improve the banking industrys ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk the lcr measures an institutions hqla against its net cash outflows hqla primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the lcr rule we report lcr to the federal reserve daily for the quarters ended june and december daily average lcr for the parent company was and respectively the impact of higher deposits on the parent companys lcr is offset by a cap known as the transferability restriction on the hqla from state street bank and trust that can be recognized at the parent company as defined in the us lcr final rule as it prohibits the upstreaming of liquidity under stress the average hqla for the parent company under the lcr final rule definition was billion and billion postprescribed haircuts for the quarters ended june and december respectively for the quarter ended june lcr for state street bank and trust was approximately state street bank and trusts lcr is higher than the parent companys lcr primarily due to application of the transferability restriction in the lcr final rule to the calculation of the parent companys lcr this restriction limits the hqla used in the calculation of the parent companys lcr to the amount of net cash outflows of its principal banking subsidiary state street bank and trust this transferability restriction does not apply in the calculation of state street bank and trusts lcr and therefore state street bank and trusts lcr reflects the benefit of all of its hqla holdings we maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the federal reserve of approximately billion at the federal reserve the ecb and other nonus central banks for the quarter ended june and billion for the quarter ended december the lower levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect lower levels of client deposits liquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the federal reserve bank of boston frbb the fhlb and other nonus central banks state street bank is a member of the fhlb this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against highquality collateral which helps facilitate assetandliability management as of both june and december we had no outstanding borrowings from the fhlb access to primary intraday and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions as of both june and december we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the frbb discount window or any other central bank facility in addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity we have significant amounts of other unencumbered investment securities these securities are available sources of liquidity although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset liquidity state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the average fair value of total unencumbered securities was billion for the quarter ended june compared to billion for the quarter ended december uses of liquidity significant uses of our liquidity could result from the following withdrawals of client deposits drawdowns by our custody clients of lines of credit advances to clients to settle securities transactions increases in our investment and loan portfolios or other permitted purposes such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings a recurring use of our liquidity involves our deployment of hqla from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our enhanced custody program we had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling billion and billion and standby letters of credit totaling billion and billion as of june and december respectively these amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral as of june approximately of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and of our standby letters of credit expire within one year since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements resolution planning under section 165d of the doddfrank act we are required to submit a resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the federal reserve and the fdic the agencies the purpose of our resolution plan is to describe our preferred resolution strategy and to demonstrate that we have the resources and capabilities to execute on that strategy in the event of major financial distress through resolution planning we seek to maintain our role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system while minimizing risk to the financial system the final rule published in the federal register on november requires a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan on an alternating basis in the relevant submission years we submitted our updated targeted 165d resolution plan by july the targeted resolution plan included the core elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level information about the impact of the covid19 pandemic on resolution planning in addition actions taken to remediate the shortcoming related to the implementation of governance mechanisms were included in the plan our next full resolution plan is due july in the event of material financial distress our preferred resolution strategy is the spoe strategy the spoe strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the parent company and pursuant to a support agreement among the parent company ssif a direct subsidiary of the parent company our beneficiary entities as defined below and certain of our other entities ssif is obligated up to its available resources to recapitalize andor provide liquidity to state street bank and the other entities benefiting from such capital andor liquidity support collectively with state street bank beneficiary entities in amounts designed to prevent the beneficiary entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings following the recapitalization of or provision of liquidity to the beneficiary entities the parent company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the us bankruptcy code the beneficiary entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the parent companys claimants under the support agreement the parent company has prefunded ssif by contributing certain of its assets primarily its liquid assets cash deposits investments in intercompany debt investments in marketable securities and other cash and noncash equivalent investments to ssif at the time it entered into the support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets to the extent available on an ongoing basis in consideration for these contributions ssif has agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the parent company and all of the beneficiary entities in accordance with the parent companys capital and liquidity policies under the support agreement the parent company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif has provided the parent company with a committed credit line and issued and may issue one or more promissory notes to the parent company the parent company funding notes that together are intended to allow the parent company to continue to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a recapitalization event which is defined under the support agreement as the earlier occurrence of one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or the authorization by the parent companys board of directors for the parent company to commence bankruptcy proceedings the support agreement does not obligate ssif to maintain any specific level of resources and ssif may not have sufficient resources to implement the spoe strategy state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the event a recapitalization event occurs the obligations outstanding under the parent company funding notes would automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to ssif the obligations of the parent company and ssif under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the parent company and ssif would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the beneficiary entities ssif is a distinct legal entity separate from the parent company and the parent companys other affiliates in accordance with our policies we are required to monitor on an ongoing basis the capital and liquidity needs of state street bank and our other beneficiary entities to support this process we have established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur the trigger thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support that results in us emerging from resolution as a stabilized institution with market confidence restored upon the occurrence of a recapitalization event ssif would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the parent company the parent company would be required to contribute to ssif any remaining assets it is required to contribute to ssif under the support agreement which specifically exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the beneficiary entities to support such entities continued operation to the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement and the parent company would be expected to commence chapter proceedings under the us bankruptcy code no person or entity other than a party to the support agreement should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a beneficiary entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditors perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities state street bank is also required to submit periodically to the fdic a plan for resolution in the event of its failure referred to as an idi plan we submitted our last idi plan before july in november the fdic had announced that until the fdic completed revisions to its idi plan requirements no idi plans would be required to be filed on june the fdic issued a policy statement on resolution plans for idis that allows for content streamlining and adjusts the frequency of submissions to a threeyear cycle state street banks next idi plan submission deadline is december additionally we are required to submit a recovery plan to the federal reserve this plan includes detailed governance triggers and contingency actions that can be implemented in a timely manner in the event of extreme financial distress we also have recovery planning requirements in certain international jurisdictions where we operate funding deposits we provide products and services including custody accounting administration daily pricing fx services cash management financial asset management securities finance and investment advisory services as a provider of these products and services we generate client deposits which have generally provided a stable lowcost source of funds as a global custodian clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies as of both june and december approximately of our average total deposit balances were denominated in us dollars in eur in gbp and in all other currencies shortterm funding our onbalance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets but more importantly they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales in addition our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors as discussed earlier under asset liquidity state street banks membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against highquality collateral shortterm secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase these transactions are shortterm in nature generally overnight and are collateralized by highquality investment securities these balances were billion and billion as of june and december respectively state street bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of cad billion or approximately billion as of june to support its canadian securities processing operations the line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice as of both june and state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations december there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit longterm funding we have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business needs in addition state street bank also has current authorization from the board to issue unsecured senior debt the total amount remaining for issuance pursuant to this authority is billion as of june on february we issued million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due on march we redeemed million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due on may we issued million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due on may we redeemed million aggregate principal amount of fixedtofloating rate senior notes due agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings relative market position strong risk management strong capital ratios diverse liquidity sources including the global capital markets and client deposits strong liquidity monitoring procedures and preparedness for current or future regulatory developments high ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products serving markets and engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings a downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets which could increase the related cost of funds in turn this could cause the sudden and largescale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients which could lead to drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10q other funding sources such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements for which there are no explicit triggers could also be adversely affected operational risk management operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events tight labor markets the ongoing war in ukraine and lingering impacts from the covid19

forward contracts and interest rate futures as of june the notional amount of these derivative contracts was trillion of which trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward swap and spot contracts we seek to match positions closely with the objective of mitigating related currency and interest rate risk all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates valueatrisk and stressed var we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies including var which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval we use a risk measurement methodology to measure tradingrelated var daily we have adopted standards for measuring tradingrelated var and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements our regulatory varbased measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a twoyear observation period calibrated to a onetail confidence interval and a tenbusinessday holding period we calculate a stressed varbased measure using the same model we use to calculate var but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelvemonth periods that reflect significant financial stress the stressed var model is designed to identify the secondworst outcome occurring in the worst continuous oneyear rolling period since july this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling tenday period with an outcome that is worse than of other outcomes during that twelvemonth period of financial stress for each portfolio the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the oneyear time horizon that produces the largest tenbusinessday var from within the available historical data this historical data set includes the financial crisis of the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard poors downgrade of us treasury debt in august and the market volatility triggered by the covid19 pandemic in march as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time future market stress events will be incorporated for additional information about our var measurement tools and methodologies refer to pages to included under item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations valueatrisk and stressed var in our form 10k state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations stress testing we have a corporatewide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions we also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch risk component and currency pairs we conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur and we also perform stress testing as part of the federal reserves ccar process stress testing is conducted analyzed and reported at the corporate trading desk division and riskfactor level for example exchange risk interest rate risk and volatility risk stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by enterprise risk management erm and reported to the credit and market risk committee cmrc limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units escalated as appropriate and reviewed by the cmrc if material in addition we have established several action triggers that prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan validation and backtesting we perform frequent backtesting to assess the accuracy of our varbased model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level this backtesting involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily actual profitandloss pl outcomes observed from daily market movements we backtest our var model using clean pl which excludes nontrading revenue such as fees commissions and nii as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves such as fees commissions changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday activity we had no backtesting exceptions in the quarter ended june one backtesting exception in the quarter ended march and no backtesting exceptions in the quarter ended june at a confidence interval the statistical expectation for a var model is to witness one exception every hundred trading days or two to three exceptions per year the following tables present var and

of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading activities while overall levels of volatility have varied over the historical observation periods smaller residual market

liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable nii under varying economic conditions while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates while many market factors affect the level of nii and the economic value of our assets and liabilities one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates most of our nii is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the liquidity characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities as well as the currency composition of our significant nonus dollar denominated client deposits we quantify nii sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning this measure compares our baseline view of nii over a twelvemonth horizon based on our internal forecast of interest rates to a wide range of rate shocks our baseline view of nii is updated on a regular basis table key interest rates for baseline forecasts presents the spot and 12month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at june and june our june baseline forecast broadly aligns to the markets expectations for a rapid increase in global central bank rates in response to rising inflation in addition to higher interest rates we are also forecasting gradual deposit balance rotation and reductions along with increasing deposit betas as a result of quantitative tightening and rising interest rates table key interest rates for baseline forecasts

expected change in nii over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks to various tenors on the yield curve relative to our baseline rate forecast including the impacts from us and nonus rates each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rates changes on our financial performance while investment securities balances and composition can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change for purposes of this analysis our deposit balances and mix are assumed to remain consistent with the baseline forecast which assumes gradual deposit balance rotation and reductions in lower rate scenarios the full impact of the shock is realized for all currencies even if the result is negative interest rates table net interest

acquisition of the bbh investor services business the shortend is months the longend is years and above interim term points are interpolated as of june nii from nonus rates is expected to benefit from higher interest rates and is exposed to lower rates the benefit from higher rates is driven by the shortend of the yield curve and our deposit beta assumptions in currencies such as eur and gbp compared to june our nonus benefit to higher interest rates has increased due to rising ecb rates in our baseline forecast which assumes lower eur betas once the ecb target rate exceeds compared to june our nonus exposure to lower interest rates has also increased as we begin to realize higher levels of nii from nonus currencies in our baseline forecast as of june our nii sensitivity from us rates is limited in both higher and lower rate shocks and against short and longend rate changes this level of us nii sensitivity is primarily driven by our baseline rate forecast which assumes that the fed funds target rises to by yearend and by june once us shortend rates reach those levels the baseline forecast projects significantly higher levels of annual nii and usd deposit betas increase to the point that the repricing characteristics of our usd assets and liabilities are substantially aligned our scenarios assume that deposit betas are higher than the last us rising rate cycle from due to our current deposit mix and greater quantitative tightening this cycle by the federal reserve as of june usd nii in the 100bp shock scenario estimates million of nii at risk with the level of fed funds reaching consistent with our interest rate risk simulation methodology this estimate assumes no management action is taken to reposition the balance sheet while this is our standard modeling approach in a higher and rising rate environment management would likely target a neutral asset sensitivity posture by using interest rate swaps and other balance sheet actions compared to june our reduced benefit to higher rate scenarios is driven by rising deposit betas expectations for deposit rotation from quantitative tightening and less investment portfolio reinvestment usd nii in the 100bp shock scenario estimates a million benefit compared to june our reduced benefit to lower rates is driven by the higher usd yield curve which is no longer impacted by negative interest rates in the 100bp scenario the june sensitivities included a significant nii benefit from negative rates by charging interest on client deposits and the impacts of contractual floors on loans and securities

adjustable interest libor act which provides certain statutory requirements and guidance for the selection and use of alternative reference rates in legacy financial contracts governed by us law that do not provide for the use of a clearly defined or practicable alternative reference rate on july the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on a proposed regulation to implement the libor act as required by its terms the libor act requires implementing regulations be in place within days of its enactment we have established a process to identify assess plan for and remediate the use of libor and other reference rates affected by reference rate reform that addresses both direct exposures on our balance sheet and more importantly the use of libor in our various service provider roles to our customers this process is led by a wide multidisciplinary libor program management office libor pmo established in september that will continue to lead our transition efforts through june the libor pmo reports regularly to executive management of the firm and our key regulators on progress with respect to the adoption of alternative

general operational readiness for each stage of the transition most of the work identified by the libor pmo for implementation of the transition to alternative reference rates is substantially complete and contingency plans have been developed with respect to identified uncertainties no incremental material investments are expected to be needed for systems and processes related to the transition potential risks that could impact our remediation efforts include overall transition readiness across the industry third party vendor dependencies and resource constraints from the concentration of remediation activities at key points in the transition process our direct on balance sheet exposure to libor is limited and primarily includes assets held in the investment portfolio

compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives we assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements as well as our own internal capital goals targets and other relevant metrics our designation as a gsib is based on a number of factors as evaluated by banking regulators and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the basel iii final rule further like all other us gsibs we are also currently subject to a slr buffer in addition to the required minimum of under the basel iii final rule if we fail to exceed any regulatory buffer or surcharge we will be subject to increased restrictions depending upon the extent of the shortfall regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company and therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same capital

risk capital rule issued by us banking regulators the basel iii final rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy the standardized approach and the advanced approaches applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations like us the standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk rwa including specified risk weights for certain on and offbalance sheet exposures the advanced approaches consist of the advanced internal ratingsbased approach used for the calculation of rwa related to credit risk and the advanced measurement approach used for the calculation of rwa related to operational risk as required by the doddfrank act enacted in and the scb rule enacted in we and state street bank as advanced approaches banking organizations are subject to a capital floor also referred to as the collins amendment in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy including the capital conservation buffer ccb and the scb for the advanced approaches and standardized approach respectively and a countercyclical capital buffer in addition we are subject to a gsib surcharge our riskbased capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the advanced approaches and standardized approach the scb replaced under the standardized approach the capital conservation buffer with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institutions starting and lowest projected cet1 ratio under the ccar severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments as a percentage of rwa from the fourth through seventh quarter of the ccar planning horizon the scb requirement can be no less than of rwa breaching the scb or other regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a banking organizations ability

advanced systems in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on form 10q or an annual report on form 10k significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators and our advanced systems may not individually or collectively precisely represent or calculate the scenarios circumstances outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval for example a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution even if we do not experience a related loss could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event its characterization among the seven baseldefined uom and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event or the timing of such effects on our results of operations due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems whether resulting from changes in data inputs regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the basel iii final rule will change and may be volatile over time and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period the full effects of the basel iii
