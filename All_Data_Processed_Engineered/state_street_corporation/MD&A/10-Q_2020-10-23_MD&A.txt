securities finance and investment advisory services as a provider of these products and services we generate client deposits which have generally provided a stable lowcost source of funds as a global custodian clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies as of both september and december approximately of our average total deposit balances were denominated in us dollars approximately in eur in gbp and in all other currencies shortterm funding our onbalance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets but more importantly they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales in addition our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors as discussed earlier under asset liquidity state street banks membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against highquality collateral shortterm secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to

debtagency credit ratingsour ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fosteredby the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measuredby the major independent credit rating agencies factors essential tomaintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings relative market position strong risk management strong capital ratios diverse liquidity sources including the global capital marketsand client deposits strong liquidity monitoring procedures and preparedness for current or future regulatory developmentshigh ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors increasing the potential market for our debt and improvingour ability to offer products serving markets and engaging in transactions in which clients value high creditratings a downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have amaterial adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability toaccess the capital markets which could increase the related cost offunds in turn this could cause the sudden and largescalewithdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients which could lead todrawdowns of unfunded

interval we use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading related var daily we have adopted standards for measuring trading related var and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements our regulatory varbased measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a twoyear observation period calibrated to a onetail confidence interval and a tenbusinessday holding period we calculate a stressed varbased measure using the same model we use to calculate var but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelvemonth periods that reflect significant financial stress the stressed var model identifies the secondworst outcome occurring in the worst continuous oneyear rolling period since july this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling tenday period with an outcome that is worse than of other outcomes during that twelvemonth period of financial stress for each portfolio the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the oneyear time horizon that produces the largest tenbusinessday var from within the available historical data this historical data set includes the financial crisis of the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard poors downgrade of us treasury debt in august as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time future market stress events will be automatically incorporated for additional information about

derived from the shortend of the curve given deposit pricing expectations compared to september our nonus benefit to higher rates has decreased while the benefit to lower rates has increased the
