general state street corporation referred to as the parent company is a financial holding company organized in under the laws of the commonwealth of massachusetts our executive offices are located at one lincoln street boston massachusetts telephone for purposes of this quarterly report on s forwardlooking statements in this s including our filings under the securities exchange act of in particular our annual reports on cycle for the us gsibs including state street this cycle alternates between a targeted resolution plan followed two years later by a full resolution plan the agencies have published the scope for the upcoming targeted resolution plan to include the core elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level information including impacts from the covid19 pandemic the next resolution plan is due on july in the event of material financial distress or failure our preferred resolution strategy is the spoe strategy for additional information about the spoe strategy refer to pages to included under item business in our and whether or not a recapitalization event has occurred upon the occurrence of a recapitalization event ssif would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the parent company the parent company would be required to contribute to ssif any remaining assets it is required to contribute to ssif under the support agreement ssif would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the beneficiary entities to support such entities continued operation and the parent company would be expected to commence chapter proceedings under the us bankruptcy code no person or entity other than a party to the support agreement should rely including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditors perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities on any of our affiliates being or remaining a beneficiary entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement a recapitalization event is defined under the support agreement as the earlier occurrence of one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or the authorization by the parent companys board of directors for the parent company to commence bankruptcy proceedings these thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support the spoe strategy and the obligations under the support agreement may result in the recapitalization of state street bank and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the parent company at an earlier stage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place an expected effect of the spoe strategy and applicable tlac regulatory requirements is that losses will be imposed on the parent company shareholders and the holders of longterm debt and other forms of tlac securities currently outstanding or issued in the future by the parent company as well as on any other parent company creditors before any of its losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of the parent companys operating subsidiaries or any of their depositors or creditors or before us taxpayers are put at risk there can be no assurance that credit rating agencies in response to our resolution plan or the support agreement will not downgrade place on negative watch or change their outlook on our debt credit ratings generally or on specific debt securities any such downgrade placement on negative watch or change in outlook could adversely affect our cost of borrowing limit our access to the capital markets or result in restrictive covenants in future debt agreements and could also adversely impact the trading prices or the liquidity of our outstanding debt securities state street bank is also required to submit periodically in accordance with applicable regulations and fdic guidance a plan for resolution in the event of its failure referred to as an insured depository institution idi plan on april the federal register published the fdics advance notice of proposed rulemaking in which it invited comment on potential revisions to its idi plan requirements in addition to this advance notice of proposed rulemaking on april the fdic board voted to delay the next round of submissions under the idi rule until the rulemaking process has been completed on may the fdic released a statement notifying of its plan to issue a proposal in the current year that may require the submission of a targeted idi plan in state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funding deposits we provide products and services including custody accounting administration daily pricing fx services cash management financial asset management securities finance and investment advisory services as a provider of these products and services we generate client deposits which have generally provided a stable lowcost source of funds as a global custodian clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies as of june approximately of our average total deposit balances were denominated in us dollars approximately in eur in gbp and in all other currencies as of december approximately of our average total deposit balances were denominated in us dollars approximately in eur in gbp and in all other currencies shortterm funding our onbalance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets but more importantly they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales in addition our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors as discussed earlier under asset liquidity state street banks membership in the fhlb allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against highquality collateral shortterm secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase these transactions are shortterm in nature generally overnight and are collateralized by highquality investment securities these balances were billion and billion as of june and december respectively state street bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of cad billion or approximately billion as of june to support its canadian securities processing operations the line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice as of both june and december there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit longterm funding we have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business needs including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our clients in addition state street bank also has current authorization from the board to issue up to billion in unsecured senior debt and an additional million of subordinated debt agency credit ratings our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings relative market position strong risk management strong capital ratios diverse liquidity sources including the global capital markets and client deposits strong liquidity monitoring procedures and preparedness for current or future regulatory developments high ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by providing assurance for unsecured funding and depositors increasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products serving markets and engaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings a downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets which could increase the related cost of funds in turn this could cause the sudden and largescale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients which could lead to drawdowns of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts a majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings we assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10q other funding sources such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements for which there are no explicit triggers could also be adversely affected state street corporation managements discussion

activities is provided below under trading activities information about the market risk associated with our nontrading activities which consists primarily of interest rate risk is provided below under asset and liability management activities trading activities in the conduct of our trading activities we assume market risk the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite business objectives and liquidity needs our clients requirements and market volatility and our execution against those factors for additional information about the market risk associated with our trading activities refer to pages to included under item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our form 10k as part of our trading activities we assume positions in the fx and interestrate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments including fx forward contracts fx and interestrate options and interest rate swaps interest rate forward contracts and interest rate futures as of june the notional amount of these derivative contracts was trillion of which trillion was composed of fx forward swap and spot contracts we seek to match positions closely with the objective of tightly controlling related currency and interest rate risk all fx contracts are valued daily at current market rates valueatrisk and stressed valueatrisk we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies including var which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval we use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading related var daily we have adopted standards for measuring trading related var and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements our regulatory varbased measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a twoyear observation period calibrated to a onetail confidence interval and a tenbusinessday holding period we calculate a stressed varbased measure using the same model we use to calculate var but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelvemonth periods that reflect significant financial stress the stressed var model identifies the secondworst outcome occurring in the worst continuous oneyear rolling period since july this stressed var meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling tenday period with an outcome that is worse than of other outcomes during that twelvemonth period of financial stress for each portfolio the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the oneyear time horizon that produces the largest tenbusinessday var from within the available historical data this historical data set includes the financial crisis of the highly volatile period surrounding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the standard poors downgrade of us treasury debt in august as the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time future market stress events will be automatically incorporated state street

under item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our form 10k stress testing we have a corporatewide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions we also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch risk component and currency pairs we conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur and we also perform stress testing as part of the federal reserves ccar process stress testing is conducted analyzed and reported at the corporate trading desk division and riskfactor level for example exchange risk interest rate risk and volatility risk stress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by enterprise risk management erm and reported to the trading and markets risk committee tmrc limit breaches are addressed by erm risk managers in conjunction with the business units escalated as appropriate and reviewed by the tmrc if material in addition we have established several action triggers that prompt review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan validation and backtesting we perform frequent backtesting to assess the accuracy of our varbased model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level this backtesting involves the comparison of estimated var model outputs to daily actual pl outcomes observed from daily market movements we backtest our var model using clean pl which excludes nontrading revenue such as fees commissions and nii as well as estimated revenue from intraday trading our var definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves such as fees commissions changes to reserves and gains or losses from intraday activity we had no backtesting exceptions in the quarter ended june we had three backtesting exceptions in the quarter ended march all of which occurred during the heightened market volatility witnessed in march we had one backtesting exception in the quarter ended june the following tables

positions the varbased measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading activities overall levels of volatility have been low both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the period used for the calculations we may in the future

interest rate risk component asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable nii under varying economic conditions while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates while many market factors affect the level of nii and the economic value of our assets and liabilities one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates most of our nii is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses we invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities including the currency composition of our significant nonus dollar denominated client liabilities we quantify nii sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning this measure compares our baseline view of nii over a twelvemonth horizon based on our internal forecast of interest rates to a wide range of rate shocks table key interest rates for baseline forecasts presents the spot and 12month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at june and june our june baseline forecast assumes no changes by the federal reserve over the next months table key interest rates for baseline forecasts june june fed funds target 10year treasury fed funds target 10year treasury spot rates 12month forward rates state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in table net interest income sensitivity we report the expected change in nii over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks to various tenors on the yield curve including the impacts from us and nonus rates each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate changes on our financial performance while investment securities balances can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment assumptions change our modeling approach in the past has been to keep our balance sheet consistent with our baseline outlook in both higher and lower rate scenarios however for the june reporting period and consistent with our approach for the first quarter of we reevaluated this approach for our bps shock scenario in light of the current rate environment under this scenario which assumes that the federal reserve increases its target range by to along with increases by other central banks client deposits are modeled to return to average balance levels experienced in the fourth quarter of with a corresponding reduction in cash and cash equivalents held with central banks for the bps shock scenario at june we continue to hold the balance sheet consistent with our baseline outlook including client deposits given the amount of fiscal stimulus and monetary policy easing already implied in the baseline scenario another factor was that the current bps scenario is impacted by assumed floors as interest rates reach zero for certain currencies including us dollar scenario table net interest income sensitivity june june in millions us dollar all other currencies total us dollar all other currencies total rate change benefit exposure benefit exposure parallel shifts bps shock bps shock steeper yield curve bps shift in longend rates bps shift in shortend rates flatter yield curve bps shift in shortend rates bps shift in longend rates as of june nii is expected to benefit from both parallel increases and decreases in interest rates compared to june our nii is more sensitive to parallel rate increases primarily driven by lower deposit beta assumptions given the current interest rate environment our positioning to parallel rate decreases has shifted to benefit nii driven by changes to the composition of our deposit base as well as impacts by assumed floors as interest rates in several currencies approach zero which prevents the full extent of the rate shock to be realized us dollar nii as of june remains positioned to benefit from a parallel rise in interest rates and to decline under a parallel decrease in interest rates compared to june our us dollar nii benefit to higher rates has increased due to lower deposit betas and lower prepayments in the investment portfolio compared to june our us dollar nii sensitivity to lower rates has improved driven by changes to the composition of us deposits and cash flow hedging activity which impacts our shortend sensitivities our us declining rate scenarios are also impacted by assumed floors as us interest rates approach zero nii is still positioned to benefit from changes in nonus interest rates with the majority of our sensitivity derived from the shortend of the curve given deposit pricing expectations compared to june our nonus benefit to higher rates has decreased while the benefit to lower rates has increased the decreased benefit to higher rates is driven by emea deposit pricing actions in addition to the treatment of excess reserves by the european central bank and swiss national bank the increased benefit to lower rates is impacted by the aforementioned deposit pricing and excess reserve changes eve sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of interest rate shocks over a longterm horizon in the following table we report our eve sensitivity to bps instantaneous rate shocks relative to spot interest rates management compares the change in eve sensitivity against our aggregate tier and tier riskbased capital calculated in conformity with current applicable regulatory requirements eve sensitivity is dependent on the timing of interest and principal cash flows also the measure only evaluates the spot

value of equity sensitivity as of june in millions rate change benefit exposure bps shock bps shock as of june eve sensitivity remains exposed to upward shifts in interest rates compared to june the change in the up bps instantaneous shock scenario was primarily driven by the benefit from increased liability duration from deposit modeling updates and longterm debt issuances the down bps instantaneous shock results are impacted by assumed floors as interest rates in several currencies approach zero which prevents the full extent of the rate shock to be realized both nii sensitivity

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management in our form 10k model risk management the use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making the models contemporaneously represent both a significant

management we define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions improper implementation of strategic initiatives or lack of responsiveness to industrywide changes strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment decline in market performance or changes in our business activities and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks not already captured as market interest rate credit operational model or liquidity risks we incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans

involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives we assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements as well as our own internal capital goals targets and other relevant metrics our designation as a gsib is based on a number of factors as evaluated by banking regulators and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the basel iii rule further like all other us gsibs we are also currently subject to a leverage buffer under the basel iii rule if we fail to exceed any regulatory buffer or surcharge we will be subject to increased restrictions depending upon the extent of the shortfall regarding capital distributions and discretionary executive bonus payments not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company and

included in this notification and in light of the considerable economic uncertainty created by the covid19 pandemic all participating ccar banks will be required to resubmit their capital plans within days of the federal reserve providing updated scenarios in line with the decision to administer a new stress test the federal reserve is limiting the ability of all ccar banking organizations to make capital distributions in the third quarter of although banking organizations are permitted to pay common stock dividends at previous levels as a result ccar banking organizations including us will not be permitted to return capital to shareholders in the form of common share repurchases during the third quarter of unless otherwise approved by the federal reserve as of now our capital distributions in the fourth quarter of and beyond will be governed by our minimum capital requirements inclusive of the scb it is unclear at this time when the results of the new stress test will be made available or whether the results will impact our calculated scb and distributions beyond the third quarter of to maintain the status of the parent company as a financial holding company we and our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required among other requirements to be well capitalized as defined by regulation y and regulation h respectively the basel iii rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy the standardized approach and the advanced approaches applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations like us the standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit risk rwa including specified risk weights for certain on and offbalance sheet exposures the advanced approaches consist of the advanced internal ratingsbased approach used for the calculation of rwa related to credit risk and the advanced measurement approach used for the calculation of rwa related to operational risk state street corporation managements discussion and

market broadly or by individual financial institutions changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval for example a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution even if we do not experience a related loss could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures our total rwa and our capital ratios compared to prior periods an operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change

stability of the distributional approach for a particular uom and without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event or the timing of such effects on our results of operations due to the influence of changes in these advanced systems whether resulting from changes in data inputs regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the basel iii rule will change and may be volatile over time and that those latter

economic uncertainty created by the covid19 pandemic all participating ccar banks will be required to resubmit their capital plans within days of the federal reserve providing updated scenarios in line with the decision to administer a new stress test the federal reserve is limiting the ability of all ccar banking organizations to make capital distributions in the third quarter of although banking organizations are permitted to pay common stock dividends at previous levels as a result ccar banking organizations including us will not be permitted to return capital to shareholders in the form of common share repurchases during the third quarter of unless otherwise approved by the federal reserve as of now our capital distributions in the fourth quarter of and beyond will be governed

with us gaap and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies by their nature require management to make judgments involving significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions the more significant accounting policies applied by us have been identified by management as those associated with recurring fair value measurements impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets contingencies and allowance for credit losses these accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available an understanding of the judgments estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition allowance for credit losses in january we adopted asc which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology we maintain an allowance for credit losses to support our onbalance sheet credit exposures including financial assets held at amortized cost and investment securities held tomaturity we also maintain an allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our offbalance credit exposure the two components together represent the allowance for credit losses determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods we estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset while factoring in prepayment activity where supported by data over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period we utilize a baseline upside and downside scenario which are applied based on a probability weighting in order to better reflect managements expectation of expected credit losses state street corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment the multiple scenarios are based on a three year horizon or less depending on contractual maturity and then revert linearly over a two year period to a tenyear historical average thereafter the
