the risk factors in our s in were obviously working through the closing process and would are continuing to target a yearend close state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 in terms of asset sensitivity i think its a little early to model it too finely but i think i would say is that the asset sensitivity of the book is probably in the range of what we have at state street just because its similar asset managementoriented clients they have similar expectations of deposits and deposit pricing and i think you get similar betas and well similar betas and adjustments overall i think whats different brennan and constructive here is because of the brown brothers bank sweep program we have more flexibility than usual to either bring in deposits at attractive rates and so that could in a way enhance our asset sensitivity though you have to be careful by the you have to model that in or it could let us protect the size of the balance sheet and the leverage constraint leverage ratio constraints that we have which also led us adjust some amount of preferred securities that we need to run the business so id say overall its probably in the same ballpark but with an ability through the rate cycle to either add deposits and nii or to manage leverage and i think thats a constructive program and a new functionality that they bring to us and one that will continue in terms of the expense guide i did say i was hopeful itd be a bit on the conservative side i think the expense guide was for a reduction of about so kind of i think on the lower end of what weve achieved before i think but its hard to compare to past deals too i guess too forcefully because every deal is different we need to bring this business on and ive said in the past weve not always finished what weve started and made sure that all the integration happens and all the functionality that we bring in from an acquisition gets fully integrated and created in our own offering and i think thats why its been at the lower end of our expense savings targets but i think theres well see i think its early i think well be well certainly give guidance as to some of those cost estimates in january and well certainly keep you posted but we stand by the guidance and as the cfo im hopeful we can we certainly want to meet those and i always like to exceed where i can but i think its a little early to lean too far brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thank you ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hey brennan its ron what i would just add to that is weve emphasized about this acquisition it is about capabilities and geographic reach and talent so as we think about the synergies here were thinking about them as combined synergies if you will i mean theres instances where theres just some better capabilities that exist over at brown brothers brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for all that color and then for my second question ron actually eric when you provided the color on the fourth quarter expense expectation you made reference to some needs to invest and whatnot i know its probably early youre probably just starting to work on the budget for but cost inflation is very much on the minds of investors we hear about it broadly one of your competitors at a recent conference raised a point that there would probably be some upward expense pressure in should we begin to prepare for a bit of a lift is it appropriate maybe to use the fourth quarter as the jumping off point and then adjust for seasonality state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 and then think about that into next year is there just some general guiding principles you could provide to help people level set on ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah brennan let me start on that okay because we are definitely seeing instances where there is some cost pressure but itd be untrue to say that its across the board certain types of employees for example in the technology area as youd expect because there were not just competing with other custody banks were competing with technology firms so we are definitely seeing that but we also continue to see productivity improvements in our business were engineering them in so we do see an ability to offset some if not all that and were just going to be careful about how we proceed forward we dont want to underinvest in key staff but we also think that i mean as we see performance we can pay for performance and do it through the incentive line so its something were watching out for and there are particular areas where we are seeing the need to raise the fixed cost of talent but not at an overwhelming were not seeing an overwhelming kind of thing yet eric you probably want to add something eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah brennan id add to that you go through the line items of expenses ron covered the salary comp incentives and obviously we have a little pressure there but we also have a little more attrition i think everyones seeing that as they so were trying to we need to net that out as we go into next year i think you see a little bit of creep on the tech side obviously some of those cost and transactional costs but again we have our engineering programs to offset some of that and while it means theres more work to do theres always more work to do thats just how it plays out i think from a if you step back and you say what are the guiding principles that we use as we go into our budget process which has just really started and full swing in november and then comes through in december is really about how do we continue to make healthy or solid progress in expanding margin each year how do we do that with positive operating leverage and youve heard me say before we dont like to live on the edge and be too hopeful of an equity market tailwind or something of that sort and so i think youve got to think of it as commitment to progressing towards our mediumterm targets and progressing at pace where we can make progress each year youve seen us notwithstanding the interest rate headwinds this year were making progress this year towards those targets were proud of that and we need to feel like we need to continue that brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for all that color operator your next question is from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so two questions one i think on the expense side one of the reasons why there are so many questions here is that there had been a period where state street had a tougher time delivering positive operating leverage and then more recently youve had very good success so when i hear the point about hey were going to be reinvesting a bit for future growth im just wondering is this a message we should take that the investment spend was a bit under you underinvested over the past yearandahalf and now were going to ramp back up to normal or is this more of a temporary weve got some things specific opportunities that we need to invest in we cant tell you how many quarters its going to take but its more of a specific opportunity and the positive operating leverage weve been used to seeing recently will persist once we get through this period i guess thats part of the reason why theres so many questions on expenses and if we could frame it like that would there be any more color you could share with us thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp betsy its ron so weve been we certainly have not been underinvesting in our business and whether its inorganic or organic i mean obviously theres charles river more recently brown brothers on an inorganic basis but as weve tried to emphasize quarteroverquarter every time weve talked about us keeping expenses flat or even down thats been done by a fairly aggressive engineering effort to bring down bau expenses while also continuing to invest in the business particularly in the technology area in terms of future investments we just see the momentum building in areas where weve already started to invest and theres opportunity to invest more and accelerate growth and the three areas that we highlighted were one just continuing to invest in alpha and kind of bring more and more of that to market quicker second is private markets and then third is the whole digital space where youre seeing a lot of activity there and thats a combination of both supporting our clients in their digital kinds of ventures and also continuing to go to the next stage of digitization of our own business so thats what were talking about there and again i would underscore what i said at the end of my prepared remarks that we will do so with a commitment to positive operating leverage and continued margin expansion over the short to medium term eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats great color and those three threads those are top of our list too in terms of revenuegenerating growth potential over the next three to five years so that seems like it makes a lot of sense to be investing for that maybe a little bit more quarterlyoriented kind of question but just on the loan growth that you saw in the quarter i just want to get a sense as to key drivers of that growth and should we think that it was specific to this quarter or there is a demand there that well likely see that kind of growth continue as we look into next year thanks state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp betsy its eric its a little bit of both actually we saw higher than usual opportunities this quarter i think sequentially our loan balances were up were talking billion thats quite a bit on a billion base of loans a little bit of that was some discretionary lending we do and then some of it was literally higher demand from private equity capital call financing obviously as the alternatives markets continues to boom some of our classic fund finance clients were looking for some support and so forth so i think it was a higher than usual quarterly print i think yearonyear what were seeing is some confidence that we can grow this loan book in the low doubledigits which is nice the one thing we are conscious of though is with loans comes rwa and so what were always doing in background is optimizing the riskweighted asset and the returns mix of those loans to make sure that in some cases we add in other cases we sell fund by optimizing other positions and thatll be part of how we think about it going forward but we do think of lending as an opportunity for us to drive nii in the coming quarters and years betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks eric eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator your next question is from glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello guys i wonder if you could expand on the nii discussion just talk about what you think are nonoperating excess deposits right now and how you think they behave indiscernible model them behaving in a modestly rising world as we go into next year thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah glenn its a really good and hard question because theres not an easy answer to them i think we clearly have like others have had some amount of excess deposits flow in what i would say though is if you go back call it two years you can ask the question is that the typical deposits and is all the increase excess and id say thats not true what weve had over the last two years is very significant growth in our aucas and with aucas right clients need to leave a certain amount of cash with us to handle the transaction volumes and so a good bit of the increase that weve seen over the last couple of years is on the core deposit side there is though some as youve seen that is excess and we pulled off i think a reasonable amount this quarter we dont necessarily want to push down deposits too far because we do want to be there for our clients if you go from with that context to the i think the next part of your question which is what happens in either tighter monetary policy with a slower expansion of the feds balance sheet or rising rates does that reverse the state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 course of deposits i think it will eventually but i think itll be a while itll be a two to threeyear process for that to happen and part of the reason i say that is the fed continues even under a tapering to expand its balance sheet right theyre just expanding it less is what the talk is all about its not about actually stopping the expansion of its balance sheet and so as the fed continues to expand its balance sheet and then signal rising rates i think were probably going to be in an environment of having healthy deposit levels which effectively mean theyre core right partly driven by the auca need and partly driven by just the surplus of cash in the system and rising rates which i think would be positive to certainly our balance sheet and nii and to the to other banks as well glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate that i wonder if you could just expand a little bit more on your thoughts you mentioned private markets is one of the key growth areas youre one of the pioneers on the custody side of that what does mercatus do for you and what can and cant you do right now for the expanding world of private markets thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah and private markets is a broad area which is why i think we see some opportunities if you recall theres hedge fund activity in private markets there is classic private equity theres more fixed income kind of loan oriented private markets theres real estate and so its in each of those areas where theres not one investment we need to make but a series as we pick our spots and pick our spots not only across each of those products but make some choices geographically as well what mercatus brings is a set of frontend functionality that we can use to support our private equity and other private market clients so functionality around reporting to lps reporting to their own partnership and thats the front end that i think we value and with that comes a set of data feeds and communication thats quite valuable and if you think about that that is directly plugs into the historical custodial operation that we provide and why were so excited about it ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hey glenn what i would add to this that market is still largely a insourced market so this isnt about slugging it out with competitors and a race to the bottom on fees its to be able to demonstrate a better offering than what these institutions are doing for themselves the stakes are going up for them in terms of data reporting particularly in esg reporting its not just that investors are demanding it but in some cases particularly outside the us and europe youre seeing reporting requirements being imposed not just on public companies but on private companies and investors want to know whats in their portfolio including their private portfolio so we think this is all going to be and mercatus helps us do that and this will all be further impetus to drive this to a more outsourced model glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you for all that appreciate it state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 operator your next question is from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies company thanks good morning hey eric just want a couple of cleanups here so you said that the premium am was improved but youve called it episodic but just wanted to understand like what was that premium am number in the third quarter so we can understand i think you said it would continue to improve so i just want to understand what the delta was this quarter eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah i think the best way to describe it ken is remember every quarter we get some headwind from the compression in underlying yields in the portfolio and what offsets that is less and less premium amortization which comes through as a negative but its a smaller negative each quarter and this past quarter i said about a third of the million improvement was from ill describe as an excess reduction in premium amortization and thats the piece we dont expect to repeat we do as i said continue to expect some marginal headwinds in the underlying portfolio yields we do expect some ongoing reduction in premium amortization not just at that same level and then weve also been pleased with some of what weve been able to do on the balance sheet asset size around lending and the investment portfolio and thats why we took our range up but were a little conscious that the fourth quarter print we gave a range purposely we dont think the third quarter print is necessarily a perfect indicator of that but all that said i think were pleased with the direction that nii has taken over the last couple quarters and we think that sets us up for the future as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies company so do you have a number to give us versus the million in the second quarter eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp i think youll have to help me i think in the second quarter we had nii of million in the third quarter million and i think the range i gave you was million to for the for fourth quarter thats total nii i think what im trying to message is there are pieces below the surface and we could get into a great amount of detail but thats kind of where the net falls out ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay so on money market fee waivers can you tell us what the money market fee waivers in asset management were in the third quarter eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 sure in the third quarter the money market fee waivers were about million back in the second quarter they were close to million and thats why we thought at current levels of frontend rates which have stabilized we said that fourth quarter is likely to be around the million million that we just saw ken usdin q analyst jefferies company and what about the other fee waivers that were million in the second quarter do you have what that was in the third eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp i think were focused the biggest driver of money market fee waivers in our systems for ga for our global advisors business thats the one weve spent the most time tracking i think is material i think the and dominates so i think thats the area to focus on ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay thanks a lot eric eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp eric aboaf sure operator your next question is from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks first one is just on the asset servicing side eric if you can maybe just sort of maybe give us a view on that stepup of asset servicing fee growth at legacy state street not including brown brothers in and given that the new wins have been so strong and youre running at more than double the pace required to offset the pricing headwinds so i mean i guess the short question here is should we expect a stepup in organic growth of asset servicing in and again in given that pipeline and not factoring in any kind of or ignoring the market side of it eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp brian its eric i think its a little early to get out and start to forecast and i think what i was trying to signal is were very pleased with our sales performance this year what weve been able to book and that clearly is going to be part of the components of delivering growth in and i would say we and ive said this before we need to earn our keep every quarter by continuing to drive sales and wins and you saw that in the first quarter we had million of auca wins were very pleased with that were pleased again with the second quarter with the third quarter we need to keep at it because if you step back remember a portion of every years wins gets implemented in that particular year its something like a third about twothirds of a years wins typically is gets reported in the following calendar year and then you still have some its probably like a sixth in the year after that state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 so were in a business where what we indiscernible we then start to implement and then we need to keep up that progress and thats what drives growth and so id say were on a good trajectory were pleased with this years successes and wed like to continue to be successful and we expect to be given our pipeline but its still early to forecast actual growth for next year and the year after brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay thats fair enough and then ron just back on ssga obviously you made a good case for the growth in that business longer term but as you just think of strategically state street as a whole obviously youve been the clear and away leader in the core asset servicing business and your you continue to enhance that lead with crd and bbh and other investments for organically growing it so as you think about state street longer term maybe would you prefer to be more of a pure play on that leadership position or would you prefer to have the balance of the asset management business within that and i guess also is it really critical that you need ssga for preferential capital treatment for going through the fed stress test and ccar ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp well brian i mean if you think about our portfolio of businesses were far and away the narrowest of both the us and the total gsifi population so were pretty focused to begin with and if you think about those two broad businesses because i would put markets underneath our investment servicing business because its really there to support that business so if you think about those two businesses they really are they fall under that single purpose of helping institutional investors achieve better outcomes so we start out from a position of being very focused and then we ask ourselves all the time first are we satisfied with our performance and second are we the right owner for these businesses and at this point as we look at it we think and believe that given the performance given the somewhat symbiotic relationship between two businesses that having this participation in that business is actually enhancing and as you note it certainly is helpful from a capital perspective and relative to our investment servicing and related activities its a capitallight business so when you add it all together we like the business but we recognize that you as shareholders can take care of diversification and its not up to us to diversify for you we have to make sure that as owners of these businesses that were good owners and we can continue to grow the business and we are looking at this all the time brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats great color thank you operator your next question is from jim mitchell with seaport research james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 hey good morning maybe just on the security servicing side outside of oneoff large outflows like the blackrock biz can you speak to your efforts to reduce client attrition and kind of get that trillion bogey of annual gross outflows down to really start to enhance the net growth from that side of the equation eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp jim its eric let me start there is a long history here in serving our clients serving them well and being incredibly focused on what they need and thats what both create sales and sales opportunity because weve said over time something like twothirds three quarters of our sales come from our existing clients and the other side of that coin is staying close to our clients understanding their needs being there when they add funds or when they consider other options is also a big part of what we do now sometimes our clients are involved in ma and we need to rebid what weve got and so we have very active programs when that happens and thats part of the industry weve got a set of client nps net promoter score work that we do that weve expanded over the last two years to now take on a very large portion of our clients so that provides realtime feedback to us from the csuite on down to the operational portions of our clients and then its our coverage program i think you saw us back in june describe how we do coverage with our global client division our premium our preferred and each one of them is geared towards making sure that were staying close and supporting our clients and making sure theyre as satisfied and as can be so those are some of the elements and id say its deep in our culture and something we work on that said youve got to keep if we want to grow and deliver core growth like weve done in the last few quarters weve been able to drive core growth which were very pleased with we got to keep expanding and selling both to existing and to new clients and youve seen us do that successfully and then on the other side we i think we feel quite good about our retention rates and that will be thats always an area of intense effort and id say this year has been successful as well james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay thats helpful and maybe just a second question on enhanced custody if i look at the if im reading the balance sheet correctly it seems like youve had very significant growth there is there any constraints on growing that business from a balance sheet perspective capital perspective how we think about the whats driving the growth and the outlook for that over the next year or two eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure jim its eric again i think for all of our balance sheet businesses we always need to be careful about how much they consume in riskweighted assets versus the earnings and the opportunities that they can provide us we do that certainly on a standalone basis because youve got to look at every asset on the balance sheet whether its lending asset for our loan book for example or securities finance business or enhanced custody business or fx business and then you also have to think about it within the context of the client relationship because theres always a give and take and for a client that may not borrow very much where they do more securities finance for enhanced custody that can be a reasonable mix and a way to serve them but to serve them with decent returns state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 so id say theres certainly room in these businesses but i think what we are doing is going into the end of the year as we close the brown brothers acquisition we are being a bit disciplined about our riskweighted asset position right because we want to close that deal and we want to land within our capital ratios and so i think while youve seen some very heavy growth in the last couple of quarters just in the next one to two quarters i think youll see youll continue to see some discipline youve seen a little bit of that on the quarteronquarter balance sheet in some of the areas like securities finance and you can imagine well do that going into the beginning of next year but what i would say is i think the franchise as we continue to grow the fee portion of the revenue base manage our expenses we can continue to put more capital to work over time but sometimes therell be some ebbs and flows and i think ive given you a little bit of an indication where we see some of those james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay great thanks operator your next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so eric i wanted to start off just discussing some comments you made actually a bit ago at the bab conference you talked about the servicing fee growth algorithm and you framed it based on expectations around new store and samestore sales growth pricing pressures what have you and i was hoping you can maybe just update us on how your thinking has evolved with regard to that algorithm whether its strengthened just given the improved outcomes that were seeing in terms of new business wins at least relative to what youve seen historically eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah steve i think the algorithm that youre referring to that weve that ive described and weve described as a company is that servicing fee growth comes from a mix of equity market tailwinds client activity inflows net new business we can either be positive as it has been the last couple of quarters neutral or negative and then pricing headwinds right its that fourpart structure i think the way id update that is to say that the structure is still there and i think been fortified i think the different areas move around a bit i think equity market tailwinds weve seen very strong equity market tailwinds this year i dont think were going to see that every year but wed like to see flat to up equity market so you can imagine that part of the tailwind was very positive this year which were pleased with and the way we monetized that is we didnt take our expenses up with equity market uptick the second one is client flows and activities i think a couple of years back this was a positive by a couple points i think a year or two ago as we saw outflows from packaged products in both especially in the us as mutual funds were on the wane and we saw less inflows in europe i think we felt less confident in client activity and flows as the tailwind i think thats actually rebounded nicely this year and we expect that to continue given the current market dynamics state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 net new business as you referenced i think weve got a strong year here in terms of wins that will now start to get implemented next year and the year after so that takes time but were pleased with the backlog and then pricing i think as ive said i think on the first question this morning has been well controlled and we just work on that intensely every day so i think the structure is intact every year will bring a little different mix and different elements of the of that framework steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that color eric and just for my followup i know you provided some helpful color on the bbh rate sensitivity additional flex from having the offbalance sheet ph suite up option i was just curious how the improving rate backdrop just taking the forward curve informs your willingness to onboard more than the billion of deposits which you disclosed at the time of the deal and just speak to the relative attractiveness of onboarding a larger percentage of deposits versus maybe other forms of capital return like buybacks and dividend increase eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure and let me open up the aperture a little bit remember the core of our capital constraint is around cet1 right our common equity tier ratio which is really a riskweighted assetbased measure not a leverage ratio measure so on the leverage ratio we just need to be kind of within bounds and so the decision on deposits and nii within reason is really around what rate levels were sitting at i think the way to think about deposits is when prevailing short rates call it fed funds is at the current levels near zero youre not incentive to have deposits on the balance sheet that breakeven tends to flip at around two or three rate hikes around basis points of fed funds you start to be in a more neutral position and at basis points of fed funds you start to be the right way around or youd prefer the deposits on the balance sheet and so its somewhere in that area call it two three rate hikes from now where we begin to seriously thinking about the benefit of adding more deposits instead of being instead of holding them off and so i think the question that we will the decision criteria that well get to is where are prevailing rates in the first quarter and the second quarter and the third quarter next year and at that point well make some conscious decisions and trade off additional nii which wed like to bring in because it helps with our margin and our eps and well just have to just be careful about the balance sheet size but youve seen us manage the balance sheet size you saw it this quarter and in fact its not like we well we know where to judiciously manage the balance sheet i think well continue to do that while bringing on deposits and serving our clients as best we can steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color eric thanks so much for taking my questions eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator the next question is from gerard cassidy with rbc state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning ron good morning eric ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc eric can you share with us when you guys look at your asset under custody wins can you break it out geographically and also are the wins coming from competitors or are they coming from just companies that were doing it internally and now have chosen to go with somebody like yourself and how do the numbers in this quarter look compared to the prior couple of years is there shifts going on in either of those two dynamics ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah gerard maybe ill begin and eric will add in color if you look at this quarter the standout obviously from an auca was legal general so mostly uk but some theres an american element to that also in that case it was for the most part a new client to us we did not have we had a nominal existing relationship to it and its an alphadriven mandate so lots of activities will be coming our way over time if you look at the prior quarter again the standout there would have been invesco which was more of a us based global client where we had an existing relationship on the servicing side we are consolidating much of that and expanding into the middle and front office so i would say that what weve seen over the past couple of years in terms of the alpharelated kinds of wins its been nicely mixed geographically and as importantly its been theres been more new client wins than we would have expected from the beginning so its enabled us to drive new client growth and whats incumbent upon us then is to make sure that obviously if its a new client theyve got the traditional servicing business with somebody else so what we are doing strategically is well have the discussion on alpha well win the alpha and then say now we want to move the servicing business over in terms of the core wins i would say that theres been a little bit of a cycle here and eric will correct me if im getting this wrong but after if you go back a couple three years ago emea was relatively light relative to the us and weve seen actually over the past couple years a lot of activity in emea and its not so much that its been less us its just been more activity in emea so that had a lot to do with changing out and rebuilding a sales force and things like that that had been done in the us hadnt quite been done until more recently in emea so what we like is its nicely mixed and more recently were starting to see some activity in asiapacific and were really excited about brown brothers because of the truly leading position that they have in japan that well be able to leverage to spur even more growth there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 thank you very good as a followup question and i apologize if you guys have addressed this already in the revenue growth of servicing fees and management fees for servicing on a yearoveryear basis for management you mentioned that client flows new business growth higher market levels contributed to this growth how much of that growth was attributed to the higher market levels eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp gerard its eric it varies by business on servicing fees a large proportion of the up was driven by the equity markets tailwind a smaller proportion from client flows and net new business and then in the other direction you have the usual smaller amount of pricing headwinds and we also called out a little bit of divestiture activity so its kind of twothirdsonethird but what i think im particularly pleased with is were able to hold expenses flat notwithstanding that and thats not been our history here as weve managed on the management fee side it was just the way that business tends to be priced the market tailwinds tend to come in and are a very important part of the tailwind but we also had i think very nice net new business performance on the revenue side you see it in flows we also counted in revenues but you saw there us taking up our margin in the asset management business and so while were creating the environment for either an equity market tailwind or a flow tailwind in asset management were also managing the other side of the pl and thats been quite remunerative for us this quarter and pleasing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you and eric we all are looking forward to seeing you at the bancanalysts association of boston conference in about three weeks so we will see you then thank you eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp see you shortly operator your next question is from rob wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp good morning guys just one more on the expense side you highlighted some productivity savings this quarter and thats been a trend recently how much more is there left to do on the productivity side and how much do you think that can continue to serve as an offset to any increases in other expenses going forward ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hey rob service productivity is hard work and we have been at it now for a couple of years and despite the progress that we see we actually see more opportunities its not as easy as just in like in manufacturing just substitute a peopledriven assembly line with a bunch of robots its really activity by activity substituting ai substituting other kinds of automation trying to eliminate reconciliations and were making progress against that and we see the opportunity to do more so we see this as it requires work ongoing work and ongoing engineering but we see opportunities over the next several years to continue to do more and more of this state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp and rob its eric id just add as we adjusted our outlook a little bit part of that was just yearend incentives we need to reward really strong performance but we also talked about starting to leg into investments and we like to invest behind the revenue not ahead of the revenue but behind the revenue and thats what were doing one of those investments to be honest is engineering work right development work to actually automate processes simplify processes and so forth and so part of what were doing even into the fourth quarter is beginning some of that work so that several quarters from now a year from now two years from now theres actually an engineering benefit and so thats where it comes together as well but as ron said it takes real hard work and it gets done in phases robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp got it thank you for that eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator your next question is from vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi ron hi eric couple of questions for you folks on bbh acquisition i remember you saying on the announcement of the call something about earnouts can you talk a little bit about are these is this additional payment over and above the purchase price or is it something else for the partners who would have presumably gotten a part of that purchase price and cash that youre getting or can you give us some color on that and what the driver of that what is it tied to and over what time period ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah vivek so theres not an extra contingent payment here so lets put that aside but what we have put in place and it was part of our as we talked about expected accretion here we have put in place an incentive plan thats quite broadbased basically its a successbased pool with the factors being client onboarding and retention as well as staff retention and everybody well all of senior management fairly deep into the bbh management participates in that and theres targets out there in terms of client retention theres targets out there in terms of desired staff retention so it was really meant to align bbh people around what were aligned about which is growing our client base and keeping our best talent eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 and vivek its eric youll see those costs in the acquisition restructuring line so were purposely bounding it but including it in our financials but theyre modest theyre what youd expect us or any other acquirer to do in a deal and given the combination theres a real benefit in the execution here vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great another one on bbh and eric maybe this is more for you the bbh sweep program that you mentioned previously too how much of those deposits how much of that sweep is at risk with banks not who would not want to renew it because of capital constraints so how much of that would you need to take on and if you couldnt whats the alternative to that eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah vivek as part of our diligence we looked at every part of this acquisition how the revenues come together there where theres a lot of share of wallet opportunity expenses how it comes together and certainly the sweep program the sweep program is modest when it comes to the bank counterparties its not enormous for any one bank provider i think the top bank providers are important but if you think about what swept away i think we said about billion billion is swept away today across large banks youre not talking about a real capacity constraint and we did we have done and weve actually engaged with each of those bank counterparties most of whom we know extremely well and who we do business with right we often do business with those counterparties on the subcustody side or in terms of other arrangements and so theres kind of a theres a bidirectional set of relationships that we have so we dont see a lot of risk at this point and see more of an opportunity to actually sweep a little more sweep a little less what i would say is the core of the sweep is in us dollar and i dont need to be patriotic to say that the us dollar is an extremely valuable deposit and cash currency and so thats so theyre certainly valuable to us and global banks and so i think weve got a good program set up and we see it continuing with some upside optionality for us vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator your next question is from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi if you can provide more color on your phrase business investment for the next phase of growth that sounds like something more significant than simply tweaking budgets going into yearend or anything like that so when you talk about this next phase of growth i know you talked about alpha private markets the digital space but if state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 you maybe just give more color on the overall tech strategy and the tech budget how much are you looking to increase the tech budget from where it is now how much of that is to change the bank and which areas of tech are you investing such as the cloud or other areas thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp well mike as i said its ron as i said earlier weve been investing all along through this most recent period these last several years and as eric has noted weve invested behind our revenue growth so the gates in our investment have not been necessarily opportunities its been what can we do to fund this growth off of our bau spending and second where and how is the growth coming in in terms of what were investing in it really isnt changing much other than from a balance perspective i would say that much of the investment that youve seen over the past several years if you think about the whole resilience area the whole i mean this is imposed on all of us resilience area the cyber area would probably fall under the bau or run the bank alpha has certainly been a change the bank kind of thing and i think theres a we would anticipate a little bit of a mix shift from run to change in terms of total amounts but really its not going to be a kind of peanut butter of thing where everybody gets a little something here for their pet project it really is about those things where we see it positioning us for meaningful growth meaningful additional growth so weve explained why but that would be alpha private markets and state street digital kind of primarily what i would add to that with the continuing to selectively invest in global advisors i mean the investments weve made there in the past particularly for example in the active etf space what weve the investments we made in european etfs and then lowcost etfs all of which are growing and were gathering disproportionate share in those space so thats how we think about it i mean you shouldnt expect us to be throwing a lot of money at things that we dont know anything about or that are new to us but its about things that weve already established can give us growth and that with a little more investment we expect to be able to accelerate that growth mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so spread around the peanut butter too much but when you look at it by function like i know youve this predates you ron but when you talk about the cloud or the back office and you talk about digitizing your operations how are you looking at the cloud today in terms of public private how much of the workload has shifted where are you in that thought process and how much does that play as part of your transformation ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp i mean mike weve been very active in the cloud and weve i think talked about this in other context if you ill use an example of what were doing in charles river and alpha which is an entirely a right from the beginning when we said we were going to be open architecture and interoperable that by definition meant that it had to be cloudbased so we have quite aggressively gone to the cloud weve talked about our partnership which was one of the first in this whole security services area with microsoft and their azure products so that is very much a part of it and we think about it as being how can we i mean certainly theres a cost element to it but its also about how do we advance the business strategically and grow revenues state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator the final question is from rajiv bhatia with morningstar rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research good morning just one quick question from me theres some headlines that hedge fund flows are pretty strong so can you comment on your alternative fund administration business and what kind of growth are you seeing there ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah why dont i begin and eric will pick up rajiv i mean youre right hedge fund flows have been strong and going back to mikes effort that would be another example of where weve invested fairly significantly in new technology there and in this case using an outside provider and were enjoying the benefits of those flows and i think that you will see we expect to see more and more flows into alternatives alternatives of all types there is a further push to see this if you will go into smaller smaller accounts and the socalled democratization of it and we want to be positioned for that eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp and rajiv its eric id just add the private markets the hedge funds are all attractive asset classes for us and so yearonyear we saw a growth this year across the servicing fee franchise in the private markets youre seeing 3percentagepoint higher growth than the average for the company and thats one of the reasons why over the last year or two and certainly going into the fourth quarter next year were investing more in private markets because we see those opportunities and that adds to the growth trajectory of the company rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research got it thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator and we have no further questions at this time ill turn the call back over to our presenters ronald philip ohanley chairman president
