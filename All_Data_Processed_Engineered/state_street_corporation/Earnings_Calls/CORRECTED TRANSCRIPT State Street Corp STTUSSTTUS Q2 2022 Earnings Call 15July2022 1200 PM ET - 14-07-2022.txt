morning we released our second quarter financial results the second quarter operating environment continued to be impacted by the ongoing geopolitical events in europe and the notable macroeconomic environment the associated price and wage inflation rising interest rates fears of recession are driving declining equity in fixed income markets currency volatility and concerns over market liquidity these factors created a number of fee revenue headwinds for our businesses despite the adverse market conditions state street performed well in the second quarter with a strong balance sheet and good sales momentum while delivering strong fx trading and significantly better nii growth yearover year coupled with wellcontrolled expenses and a healthy pretax margin we remain focused on executing against our strategy and intensely managing what we can control to navigate through uncertainty drive further business momentum and achieve our mediumterm goals state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 turning to slide of our presentation i will review our second quarter highlights before eric takes you through the quarter in more detail starting with our financial performance eps decreased yearoveryear but was down just yearoveryear excluding notable items primarily a prioryear gainonsale in weaker markets were the major driver of this decline total fee revenue for the quarter declined yearoveryear primarily reflecting the impact of significantly lower global equity and fixed income market levels on servicing and management fees and the stronger us dollar within total fee revenue our global markets franchise continued to perform well with fx trading services revenue increasing yearoveryear benefiting from higher fx market volatility which drove higher spreads total revenue for the quarter declined yearoveryear but was down just excluding notable items as lower total fee revenue was largely offset by a strong nii result which increased relative to the yearago period in the face of marketrelated fee revenue headwinds in the second quarter we remain highly focused on controlling the expense base second quarter total expenses were flat yearoveryear and declined excluding notable items our ongoing productivity actions largely offset higherthananticipated salary increases and planned business investments turning to our business momentum which you can see across the middle of the slide we reported a strong quarter of new auca asset servicing wins which amounted to billion with back office services accounting for of these wins by auca as a result of this quarters good sales performance auca won but yet to be installed increased to a record trillion at quarterend during the second quarter we also reported another alpha client win with of state streets alpha clients now live as of quarterend we were also awarded the title of security services provider of the year in the financial news 20th annual trading technology sic tech awards front office software and data also experienced good business momentum in the second quarter with annual recurring revenue increasing yearoveryear to million at global advisors assets under management totaled trillion at quarterend overall second quarter aum inflows were negatively impacted by the weaker equity market environment but we still saw positive net inflows into both our cash and us lowcost etf franchises during the quarter even in a volatile environment we continued to innovate and expand our capabilities to drive future growth for example global advisors continues to press forward in active etfs in esg as illustrated by the launch of the actively managed spdr nuveen municipal bond esg etf and a number of msci climate paris aligned etfs last in terms of business momentum i was particularly pleased to see that state street was recognized as the top provider in fx services by euromoney magazine in the second quarter importantly state street regained its number one position overall for real money clients in addition to being ranked number one for best service for real money clients our fx franchise supports and complements our core investment services business and has proven to be an effective deployment of our capital turning to our balance sheet and capital despite a continued rise in interest rates our cet1 capital ratio improved significantly to at quarterend due to our active management of riskweighted assets and the mitigating actions we executed in our investment portfolio in the second quarter the strength of our balance sheet was highlighted in the second quarter with the release of the federal reserves annual ccar stress test results in june following which we announced our intention to increase state streets quarterly common stock dividend by to per share in the third quarter subject to approval by our board of directors state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 we were pleased to announce the intended increase to our quarterly common dividend as we recognize the importance of capital return to our shareholders with that in mind in the fourth quarter this year it remains our intention to resume our existing common share repurchase program in an amount reflecting interest rate levels and market conditions at that time ill now turn to our proposed acquisition of bbhs investor services business which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions we continue to be excited about the business and its people the franchise it represents and the opportunities the transaction represents for our collective clients and for accelerating our strategy ive mentioned previously that weve been engaged in ongoing dialog with us banking regulators regarding the regulatory review process and potential modifications to the transaction intended to facilitate resolution of that process based on those discussions we have developed with bbh proposed modifications to the transaction structure that the parties believe present a path forward the proposed modifications include changes to the operating model and legal entity structure and changes to the regulatory approvals required to complete the transaction as part of the proposed modified transaction state street is seeking amendments to the transaction terms including the purchase price both bbh and our board of directors would need to review and approve the modified transaction and amended terms during the third quarter we intend to finalize the proposed structure and contractual terms and confirm our approach with regulators assuming the financial and operational aspects of the proposed modifications are timely finalized and contracted subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions the parties are aiming to close the transaction at the end of the fourth quarter of however there exists significant timing uncertainty and risk that closing will extend beyond that timeline there can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction will be entered into or as to the timing or outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for this modified transaction after september either party can terminate the transaction without penalty absent further agreement of the parties to conclude as we progress towards our mediumterm targets in this uncertain environment we remain particularly focused on maintaining and further improving our pretax margin performance which despite the challenging market conditions increased almost for the quarter excluding notable items to help achieve this goal in the face of inflationary pressure and a challenging revenue environment we will continue to exhibit expense discipline and to drive our automation and productivity efforts we also remain laser focused on innovating for the benefit of our clients and driving organic growth as demonstrated by the strong auca wins in the second quarter all while returning capital to our shareholders and with that let me turn it over to eric to take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron and good afternoon everyone ill begin my review of our second quarter results on slide we reported eps of or excluding acquisition and restructuring costs as detailed on the panel on the right side of the slide as ron noted earlier the operating environment in the second quarter remained challenging largely characterized by continued market volatility related to macroeconomic events and continued geopolitical uncertainties state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 as you can see on the left panel of the slide strong growth in both net interest income and fx trading enabled us to partially offset significant headwinds from lower equity and fixed income markets in the quarter that impacted other fee areas also evidenced by todays results our approach to expense management remains very disciplined and deliberate on a yearonyear basis second quarter expenses were down even as we experienced higherthanexpected wage increases and continued to thoughtfully invest in the franchise lastly youll see that in the second quarter we had a lowerthanexpected tax rate the bulk of the discrete tax items that contributed to our lower taxes were due to the reassessment of a deferred tax asset worth roughly million all things considered during the quarter our business model demonstrated resilience against the challenging backdrop turning to slide during the quarter we saw periodend auca decreased by on a yearonyear basis and sequentially amidst continued and uncertain economic conditions the yearonyear change was largely driven by lower periodend market levels across just about every equity and fixed income market around the world partially offset by net new business and client flows the quarteronquarter decline was largely a result of the same lower periodend market levels as weve also started to see industry outflows from investment products as the riskoff sentiment continues similarly at global advisors quarterend aum decreased yearonyear and sequentially the yearon year decline in aum was also largely driven by lower periodend market levels and institutional net outflows which was partially offset by positive net inflows in both our us lowcost etf complex and cash inflows in the quarter turning to slide on the left side of the page youll see second quarter total servicing fees down yearon year largely driven by lower average equity and fixed income market levels normal pricing headwinds client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency translation partially offset by net new business growth excluding the impact of currency translation servicing fees were down only yearonyear id also highlight that from a segment perspective we continue to see excellent revenue growth in our alternative client segment both yearonyear and quarteronquarter sequentially total servicing fees were down primarily as a result of the same drivers lower average equity and fixed income market levels client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency translation partially offset by positive net new business within servicing fees back office fees were down yearonyear and quarteronquarter largely driven by the factors i just described middle office services was down yearonyear and quarteronquarter primarily due to decreased client aum driven by lower market levels and client transaction activity and adjustments while we are seeing some compression in our legacy middle office book it is an important component of our alpha proposition when it connects to both the front office and back office and new wins generally come with contracts of to years we continue to expect to see good growth over the medium term as evidenced by our large uninstalled middle office revenue backlog of more than million which i will talk more about in a moment even against this challenging backdrop we continue to be pleased with our investment services business momentum and robust pipeline we recorded another strong quarter of new auca wins worth billion while auca won but yet to be installed amounted to trillion at quarterend as ron mentioned earlier during state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 second quarter we reported another new alpha win allspring global investments taking the total number of alpha clients to and now have implementations live lastly in response to industry inflationary cost pressures weve undergone a comprehensive analysis of our pricing across all our product areas the result of this analysis has led to the decision to begin to adjust our client pricing upwards in certain areas of servicing where the wage pressure is most acute and industry capacity is stretched ultimately we believe these pricing changes will support the continued investment that allows us to best serve our clients turning to slide second quarter management fees were million down yearonyear primarily reflecting lower average equity and fixed income market levels the impact of currency translation and a specific client repricing adjustment partially offset by the elimination of money market fee waivers and the run rate impact of net etf inflows management fees were down quarteronquarter largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds partially offset by the elimination of the same money market fee waivers as you can see on the bottom right of the slide our franchise remains wellpositioned for growth in etfs although we saw outflows in equity and commodities we continue to see inflows into spdr lowcost and fixed income etfs in our institutional business theres continued momentum in our target date franchise notwithstanding outflows primarily from one large client with very low fee assets which ultimately benefited the overall management fee rate this quarter across our cash franchise we again saw another quarter of strong net inflows this time worth billion in the quarter contributing to market share gains on slide fx trading services had yet another strong quarter relative to a period a year ago second quarter fx trading services revenue was up primarily driven by higher fx spreads partially offset by lower client fx volumes quarteronquarter fx trading services revenue was down as the benefit of higher fx spreads was more than offset by lower client fx volumes too our second quarter securities finance revenues decreased slightly yearonyear primarily driven by lower agency and enhanced custody balances due to lower markets partially offset by higher spreads sequentially revenues were up mainly reflecting higher spreads partially offset by lower agency and enhanced custody balances second quarter software and processing fees were down yearonyear and quarteronquarter largely driven by lower front office software and data revenue associated with crd which ill turn to shortly finally other fee revenues of negative million in the second quarter declined both yearonyear and quarter onquarter both the yearonyear and quarteronquarter declines largely reflect negative marketrelated adjustments while the absence of priorperiod positive fair value adjustments on equity investments also contributed to the sequential decline while we saw pressure throughout the quarter almost half of the million came through in the second half of june moving to slide let me provide some details on the performance of our front office software and data revenue in the second quarter on the left panel of the slide as a reminder crd represents the majority of these revenues but we also include alpha data services alpha data platform and mercatus revenues since they are part of our front office offering state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 on both a yearonyear and quarteronquarter basis front office software revenue declined as expected primarily driven by the absence of several onpremise renewals in the prior period as well as some episodic fees when compared to the prioryear quarter partially offset by higher softwareenabled saas revenue it is important to note however that the more durable and recurring softwareenabled and professional services revenues have continued to grow nicely with a yearonyear growth of demonstrating success in deploying our cloudbased saas platform environment to more clients turning to some of the software metrics enabled by crd and alpha on the right panel youll see that our annual recurring revenue has grown yearonyear as we convert more clients to saas which we expect will create a stickier and more profitable business model as for the middle office we continue to have an extremely healthy backlog of uninstalled revenue worth million which is almost twice the prior year lastly we are pleased to have announced another alpha mandate win this quarter were also excited to have expanded an existing alpha relationship this quarter winning approximately billion of new back office assets to custody from an asset owner client this provides another proof point that our alpha value proposition is working as were gaining more of the wallet share over time turning to slide second quarter nii increased yearonyear primarily reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and continued growth in loan balances relative to the first quarter nii was up the sequential increase was largely driven by the improvement in both short and longend rates which benefited our yields together with continued growth in loan balances partially offset by lower investment portfolio balances on the right side of the slide we show our average balance sheet during the quarter average deposits were down yearonyear and quarteronquarter primarily related to the impact from currency translation and dollar strengthening which accounted for almost half of the yearonyear decline and twothirds of the sequential decline the investment portfolio is now down modestly and we have almost of our securities now in heldto maturity were pleased that our balance sheet is wellpositioned to recognize this interest rate and nii tailwind and also protect oci turning to slide second quarter expenses excluding notable items decreased yearonyear or increased adjusted for currency translation in response to the revenue environment we have been proactively managing our expenses including lowering our incentive compensation in addition to carefully executing on our continued productivity savings efforts which generated approximately million in yearonyear gross saves or approximately million yeartodate these savings enabled us to continue to selffund the good portion of the to higher wage rates were facing and the targeted investments in the business including the alpha product technology infrastructure and broader automation compared to compensation employee benefits was down as lower incentive compensation the impact of currency translation were partially offset by salary merit increases associated with wages and inflationary pressure and higher contractor spend excluding currency translation compensation and employee benefits would have been up information systems and communications expenses was down primarily due to the episodic credits related to vendor pricing optimization and infrastructure rationalization occupancy was down due largely to currency translation and other expenses were up primarily reflecting higher recoverable clientrelated expenses which are offset in fee revenue professional fees and travel costs state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 on a quarteronquarter basis expenses were down due to seasonal expenses in the first quarter headcount increased quarteronquarter as we continue to insource some strategic technology functions from vendors as well as support growth in alpha overall in light of the current macroeconomic environment we have had pretty healthy pretax margin for the quarter at approximately excluding notable items supported by active expense management and strong nii growth moving to slide on the right side of the slide we show our capital highlights we are quite pleased to report cet1 of up basis points quarteronquarter were also happy with our performance under this years ccar with a calculated stress capital buffer well above the minimum resulting in a preliminary scb at the floor as a result in june we announced the planned increase to our quarterly common stock dividend subject to board approval and it remains our intention to again begin our existing common share repurchase program in the fourth quarter in an amount reflecting market conditions at the time to the left of the slide we show the evolution of our cet1 and tier leverage ratios as you can see this quarter even against the backdrop of a challenging operating environment we drove stronger and higher capital levels during the second quarter we completed several of the previously announced rwa optimization actions across our trading lending and investment portfolios reducing rwa billion quarteronquarter we also shifted about billion of afs securities to htm as a result we limited aoci from the investment portfolio to under million or basis points of cet1 even with a roughly 60basispoint upward interest rate move across the two and fiveyear part of the curve youll see a larger aoci move in the gaap books but much of that is ratio hedged and offset by the appreciating dollar effect on rwa with an offset in goodwill and intangibles as well given that we have now significantly reduced the oci risk to interest rate shocks by we are now comfortable operating somewhat below our standard target ranges for both cet1 and tier leverage ratios turning to slide we provide a summary of our second quarter results despite the continued volatile market environment i am pleased with our quarterly performance which demonstrates the strength of our business model the current macroeconomic environment and persistent geopolitical uncertainties notwithstanding our strong growth in both net interest income and fx trading services enabled us to partially offset significant headwinds from both equity and fixed income markets highlighting the resiliency of our franchise and our expenses remained well controlled demonstrating the progress we are making in improving our operating model now turning to outlook we would like to provide our current thinking regarding the third quarter at a macro level while market rate expectations have been volatile our current interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forward which suggests the yearend fed funds rate of we expect other major international central banks to continue raising rates with the ecb expected to start increasing rates in third quarter the current spot level of global equity markets would imply that average equity markets in would be down to quarter onquarter and us dollar appreciation to be about percentage point of headwind to revenues and tailwind to expenses which will be included in our guide now in terms of the third quarter of and on a standalone state street basis given the implied declines in average global markets we expect total fee revenue to be down about on a sequential basis and we expect both servicing fees and management fees to be down quarteronquarter driven by weaker market levels state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 turning to nii following one of the strongest sequential increases in nii for many years in we expect to deliver further growth with nii expected to increase to quarteronquarter driven by the tailwind from central bank rate hikes this outlook includes our expectation for some initial deposit outflow and rotation in and for the full year on a standalone state street basis we expect nii to increase to which is significantly better than our prior full year guide of to next we expect total expenses excluding notable items to increase just under quarteronquarter driven by inflationary pressures on wages as we continue to target productivity initiatives and execute against our strategy with a deep focus on expense discipline this focus should enable us to drive positive total operating leverage excluding notable items for the full year lastly we would expect our tax rate to be approximately for the quarter and with that let me turn the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thanks eric operator we can now open the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you sir ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions your first question comes from glenn schorr of evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much in your prepared indiscernible clientspecific pricing adjustment i just wondered if you could just give us a little more color on that so we indiscernible could be other adjustments going forward thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sorry glenn its eric youre breaking up on the audio could you i got bits of that but could you repeat that please for the for us glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi absolutely indiscernible driven by markets which is obviously going to happen but you also said clientspecific pricing adjustment i wonder if you could give a little more detail say the size of that what kind of adjustment that was just in case ph we should be thinking about it going forward eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure glenn let me try to cover that and i think youre focused on servicing fees and management fees so let me do them both so that we have a little bit of context for you on page of the materials on servicing fees you asked about the impact of client activity and adjustments and on a yearonyear basis largely due to the kind of state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 lower levels of activities and sometimes that comes through with lower markets that was worth about percentage point of headwind on a yearonyear basis and about points on a quarteronquarter basis for that on management fees there was a series of impacts quarteronquarter most of that was driven by market there was one client that we called out but that would have been worth at most to percentage points of fees for that quarter glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay and then i have just i know this would be included in your guidance but im looking for a little color of when markets i remember when they used to go up all the time youd keep temper our enthusiasm on fee rates in on fees in general servicing fees because some contracts have ceilings in them my question is if and when we continue any downtrend in these markets do those same contracts have floors should we expect more stable servicing fees if and when the markets continue to drag lower thanks a lot eric ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah glenn ill take that youre accurate we have a small number they tend to be very large clients where you just do hit the top of the fee schedule or in even in some cases the fees continued to tail down i dont think were close to that yet in terms of that being meaningful so i wouldnt expect to see that being a factor in the nearterm unless we see a much more significant kind of market downturn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay thank you ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp operator the next question operator your next question comes from ken usdin of jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies company thanks good afternoon ron just following up on your opening remarks and what we saw on the forwardlooking statements just as you go forward and try to negotiate i guess just how do you think through your optionality meaning that of course a price concession is probably your best outcome if you cant get one is that a gonot go decision right there and then if for some reason you do walk away one side or the other what becomes your next immediate steps in terms of either capital strategy or a goforward strategy thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah ken were very much in the midst of this so i dont want to get out ahead of it firstly we remain committed to the combination on a strategic basis but given that we foresee this being restructured in a way that it changes some of the operating model some of the circumstances change we do believe well we know we believe some kind of a price adjustment would be warranted state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 i dont want to get ahead of where we are in discussions with bbh they remain very amicable and both sides are committed to making this happen were committed to we like the business we like the people so obviously if we dont get there then theres a lot of options ph in the long run and wed come back to you at that time ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay thats fair and then secondly eric on your nii update the new guide just wondering how much of that update is a new curve and if you can help us understand where you are on that and what are you getting on new securities yields now versus whats rolling off the back book eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah ken the uptick in the nii guide i think probably both for the third quarter and then the full year which weve updated is primarily driven by the higher yield curve and expectations in the us plus some expectation that the ecb is going to start to seriously raise rates in the third quarter and weve said that once the ecb crosses a basispoint positive rate threshold that begins to be accretive so i think those are the major drivers on investment portfolio yield i think you see that in our average balance sheet they are up on average almost basis points quarteronquarter and youll well expect that that kind of increase will continue to flow through the books to the question of exactly what a new security comes in at versus an old security rolls out at i think that the best way to estimate that because itll vary by different parts of the book whether its the treasuries whether its the mbs whether its the foreign securities is were basically replenishing securities that have an average duration of years so you can kind of see what an older security with that vintage would look like and compare it to whats in the market today and youll see a nice pickup and thats whats flowing through and giving us the kind of quarteronquarter increase on average that you saw this quarter and well expect to see another increase on average in that order of magnitude in the third quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay great thanks eric operator your next question comes from betsy graseck of morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thank you couple of questions first just on the discussion around the forward look i wanted to make sure i understood what types of things are being looked to change is this a function of you need to keep more data servicing processing within certain countries to satisfy regulatory requirements or is there something else thats more not operational but more around what parts of the business you can do im wondering if its an expense issue or if its a revenue opportunity issue eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 betsy its eric those are all the kinds of areas were working through and i think the heart of this when you do a banking deal a global banking deal this sort is the legal entity structure and you obviously know we run a holding company a bank a series of banks and theres a series of entities that we have around the world and obviously creating a workable and a good path of combination can be done in different ways and part of what weve been working through is modifications on what might have been our original plan to make the transaction workable and attractive that then has some ramifications to your point on the operating model that will have some amount of effect on perhaps the pace of expense or pace of expense for revenue synergies and thats what were working through what we have said and wed want to reiterate is that we are committed to finding a way to preserve the economic accretion that in the range that we had previously disclosed back in september and so were highly focused on that and as a result there are some changes that were seeking on the transaction that including price that ron mentioned betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then you get this in front of regulators but if they dont agree by september youve indicated you want to close by the end of the year how should investors think about what your expected thought process is going to be between that time period september ph through the 31st ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah betsy its ron i mean the september date its basically the oneyear anniversary for the deal and like a lot of transactions they have a outside limit so the way you should interpret that is what weve said is both parties remain committed weve got to work through things i mean the regulatory world and the political world has changed significantly since we announced this deal and what were looking towards is a way to break through and close it in a reasonable time period and this time period doesnt seem reasonable to anybody but its actually better than some of the alternatives that weve been faced with so if you think about the september its an existing date and assuming everything is going along fine and parties are agreeing then we just agree to an extension of that to the close date what were doing betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp is just disclosing and reminding everybody what the terms of the transaction are betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay no thats helpful and then just last for me is i think you mentioned that given the restructuring of the balance sheet that youve made and the success with that that youre now comfortable with running potentially below management targets for cet1 slr could you remind us what the targets are and how much below youre willing to dip state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure betsy its eric i think the best place to see our capital ratios and targets is on page of the presentation deck you see our what ill call our standard cet1 targets are to our standard leverage tier leverage targets are to and what weve done as you mentioned is weve dramatically reduced the volatility risk from oci which means that were quite comfortable running below that directionally that means on cet1 for example could be up to basis points below that while we run at much lower risk and volatility levels in oci and on a leverage basis it tends to ph go out half of the of that amount betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator your next question comes from brennan hawken of ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc actually good afternoon thanks for taking the questions its been a long day eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc so eric you referenced that you were considering some adjustments to the pricing model which make a lot of sense obviously were dealing with a very inflationary environment have you begun those discussions and what has been the reaction from clients so far are you hearing from some of your clients that some of the competitors are also making similar moves just to be assured that youre not going to be out on your own pushing in that regard because its normally when we think of pricing of course in the custody world we typically its typically a tougher place to get pricing increases so kind of curious about that ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp brennan its ron why dont i start on this and eric will fill in were early in this process but yes we have been out with clients and walked through our planned price increases with a few clients at this point theres a whole plan as eric noted its around the areas where weve got the most inflationary pressure which might be specialty areas areas where theres limited capacity in the marketplace areas that are just growing very rapidly and interestingly the earliest ones have been in some ways i think clients were not surprised that it was coming at them so im not saying thats the way its going to be none of us enjoy paying more for something today than what we paid yesterday but were going at this in a very factbased way these tend to be sophisticated institutional buyers and they know whats going on so i cant speak for what others are doing i just dont have a feel for that but were running our business in the way we believe we need to and we think this is an important component of it state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that and then when we think about the you laid out eric the expectation around ecb and whatnot but as we see potential policy rates in different parts of the world diverging could you give us a reminder about the currency mix of your deposit of your deposits as it stands now and whether or not you expect in the next in the foreseeable future that to shift at all as yield differentials widen between different currencies thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure brennan its eric and we actually added some additional disclosure in our addendum our financial addendum this quarter youll find it on page that actually breaks out the balance sheet including the total assets the investment securities and deposits by the major currencies usd euros pound sterling and then and so forth because we are quite focused on navigating this interest rate environment to be honest securing the benefits of interest rate increases around the world right we position the balance sheet currency by currency we have pricing plans and betas that are carefully developed currency by currency i dont think we expect a lot of change in the composition of the balance sheet i mean the us is clearly the us central bank is clearly moving much more quickly and with not only interest rates but quantitative tightening and that will potentially have a downward trend on us currency deposits on the other hand with us rates prevailing rates higher than what you see around the rest of the world theres a natural draw into the us from global investors so its hard to i think its hard to actually forecast the currency composition and the deposit levels given those movements but were wellprepared and in fact some of the interest rate or the some of the nii increases that you saw this quarter are coming not only by virtue of the us rate rises but also those in pound sterling and some of the other anglosaxon currencies and were positioning currencybycurrency as a result brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp sure operator your next question comes from jim mitchell of seaport global please go ahead jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc oh thanks good afternoon eric maybe just on the securities portfolio you had a pretty big shift into htm to derisk the oci but im just looking at it does have a materially higher yield is there something to think about in the htm portfolio that youve kind of locked in longer duration or its a little more credit risk in there how do i think about the htm portfolio versus afs and how that can evolve does it hold back nii sensitivity or not excuse me state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp jim its eric were quite careful about managing our nii sensitivity holistically across the book i think what youll see is that because we use htm to protect against interest rate and oci volatility its more natural that if we have a blended book of short medium and longerterm securities that we would move more of the medium and longerterm securities into htm because thereby we get the most protection while we give up the least amount of sale optionality so thats why youre just seeing a higher yield i think youll see that generally be true and you can follow that in our disclosures accordingly jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great and then when i think about the yet to be installed business i mean it continues to grow i know theres a long tail to getting those installed but are we at a point where this i mean i think weve looked in the past and we i think we all get a little frustrated that we see these big wins and its hard to determine or see it in the numbers are we at a point where this is getting to materiality and that we could see a nice acceleration in organic growth next year or when this stuff gets installed eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah i think youve got the right broad timeframe i mean the i guess the way i would describe it is the larger the deal the more complex and more transformative jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp it is for our clients right thats the theyre fundamentally changing their operating model theyre harmonizing systems and processes and were coinvesting with them to build for them a front middle and often backoffice model that will suit them for a decade or more as you think about the trillion of auca to be installed is an important year we expect that about a third this will move around but about a third will likely be installed by the end of that year and perhaps as much as half of the revenue associated with those wins jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thats helpful thanks operator your next question comes from brian bedell of deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 thanks very much eric if you could just repeat that comment on the onethird of the trillion was that by the end of next year did you say i just missed that eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah thats correct by the end of brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it got it great just back to the bbh strategy so good to hear that youre both committed to this if you are able to close it with any amended terms and amended structures can you just remind us or i guess if you have comments on the deposit strategy which was obviously bringing the bbh deposits on balance sheet and then there was an opportunity to bring potentially a large portion of balances over out of from their billion of off balance sheet or thirdparty bank i should say arrangements would that still be doable or does the structure change that calculus eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brian were still in the process of nailing down both the legal entity and the operating model changes and were working through those and working towards developing a firm view of when and how the deposits and sweep program is operated and how we may in the future use that program take advantage of some of the cash and deposit optionality but thats in process at this point and well certainly provide an update in the course of the third quarter i expect as we nail down the modifications brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah that makes sense and then maybe just excluding bbh and just looking at everything on a state street only basis should we be thinking or do you think in this cycle we should be thinking of deposit runoff to be sort of similar to the last cycle i think we were down more than in average deposit levels from start of fed hiking to the trough in is that a reasonable starting point to think about that deposit runoff or something different in this cycle that would make you think that you wouldnt have that eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp i think the last cycle is always going to be indicative but you remember there were moving parts in the last cycle including the slr rule was in flux and there was many of us on the banking side had to navigate the size of our balance sheet independently of what was happening at the interest rate environment and quantitative tightening i think what ive said in the past is relevant over the since kind of the precovid time period our deposits are up roughly billion we think that half of that can easily be ascribed to the quantitative easing that we had and that will reverse out now thats an estimate and its always hard to forecast this because the interest rate environment is moving up quickly theres also a riskoff environment so weve got to see how that plays out ive said that we could see billion to billion of outflows per year per trillion of us balance sheet tightening i do think because the interest rate environment is higher and has moved faster right were likely to see closer to the billion per trillion in the first year and then maybe lighten out in the second and third year but those are all the scenarios were working through i think from our perspective were extremely flush from a liquidity state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 standpoint the deposits are valuable so were monetizing them for the purpose of the pl and we expect over time to be able to only get to the higher levels of nii that we have in the past i think we were in the million range with our peak during the last cycle i think our forecast and its hard to forecast this perfectly but the forecast that weve built put us at or above that level in this next cycle and part of that is that while there is some tightening and erosion of total deposit levels you also have higher us rates higher global rates and in particular well have a move in ecb and european rates at least based on the current forwards brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc right thats great color thank you so much eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure operator your next question comes from steven chubak of wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good afternoon so eric i wanted to better understand just some of the guidance items that you outlined specific to both fees and expenses and on the fee side certainly the guidance that you offer suggest greater resiliency compared with some of the more acute declines that weve seen in some of the market proxies just want to get a sense as to whats driving that better outcome and specific to expenses i was hoping you can give some bookends in terms of what range of expense growth we should be contemplating you cited inflationary pressures multiple times the need to maybe revisit pricing with some of your clients but you also have some fx tailwinds so i was hoping to get some perspective on what sort of expense growth range we should be thinking about for the remainder of this year eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure let me start on fees the real environmental challenge is if you just extend out the current spot levels that equity markets are sitting at the daily average for third quarter is going to be down to versus the average for second quarter and thats the basis by which we earn revenues both in servicing fees and management fees so thats the headwind that we have were hoping that some of the marketrelated the lumpy stuff that we have in other revenues doesnt repeat and that might give us a little bit of insulation so thats why i said servicing and management fees could be down the range sequentially but total fees perhaps closer to so less so and obviously volatility levels in markets help currency trading and other activities but weve got to play out and see how the summer months happen i think on expenses im just trying to guide quarterbyquarter i think if you add up first quarter second quarter the guide of just under percentage point for the third quarter and you can put a range around that and estimate fourth quarter i think thats what weve done from a guidance standpoint i think what we are willing to say is state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 because we have kind of an overall view of fee revenues for third quarter we can guesstimate into fourth quarter as can you i think nii we have quite a solid view of the full year which we provided were comfortable of saying and we said in our prepared remarks that we expect to drive positive total operating leverage for the year adjusted for notables but we feel confident in that given the current market environment and part of that is we have some visibility as weve described on fees a good bit of visibility on nii and to be honest while there are some wage and inflationary pressures because the pl is lighter weve proactively adjusted the incentive line to compensate for that and were committed to navigating through this environment in a thoughtful way and deliver results that are as positive and as appropriate as possible steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats really helpful color and just one followup on some of the expense commentary eric you offered one of the questions weve been fielding from a lot of folks pertains to the longerterm expense growth algorithm you guys have done a really good job of reining in expenses on an absolute basis over the past few years clearly the inflationary pressures are starting to build as we think about your efficiency agenda that you guys have prosecuted on but at the same time the inflationary pressure is building simultaneously how do you see that expense growth algorithm evolving over time eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah i think well know more over the course of the year but i think there are some inflationary pressures some of which we can look for ways to at least limit but we cant really avoid so let me give you an example on the billion expense base that we have about billion of that is salaries now salaries historically have moved up about percentage points a year maybe but right now if you look at merit increases the higher salary replacement rates for new hires versus exits bidding back selectively talent salary costs are up closer to to on a run rate basis on a base of billion so you could do the math there and start to get a sense that that creates an additional headwind that we didnt have and that headwind could be worth an extra point of expenses on the total billion base its that kind of environment that were operating in i mean we need to see if that persists into next year do we have a recession or not what happens to labor markets and then the other part of that is working through where we are on noncomp expenses vendors come to us sometimes and say look we feel the need to adjust and were obviously trying to manage and rein that in and i think thats another factor so i think we see some of those were trying to telegraph them but were also committed to achieve and deliver on our mediumterm targets and some of thats going to be by finding in some ways to maybe limit or contain or offset but in other ways they may come through the interest rate environment will give us a tailwind and then you heard us describe some of the selective changes that were discussing with clients around pricing and top line pricing so there are a number of different factors i think im not its early to give a fulsome view of what next year portends but i would say that were conscious were in a dynamic environment were conscious that theres some elements that we can control and others that arent as controllable but were also committed to getting to our mediumterm targets and i think that provides a good set of goals for us that were committed to state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc indiscernible sorry sorry ron ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah steve what i would add to that is that throughout this period that weve been managing expenses over the last several years as weve been quite clear on weve also been investing in the business particularly around automation and technology theres still payoffs expected from that weve seen some theres more in the future so the other bit of this well be continuing to manage that algorithm between how much we continue to spend on automating more to get the future productivity savings steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color thanks so much for taking my questions operator your next question comes from gerard cassidy of rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi ron hi eric guys maybe eric youve in the past given us an update on the variable rate pricing of your fee revenues what percentage of fee revenues today would you consider variable pricing which are greatly influenced by market levels of course and second and ron when you talked about talking about price increases for some of the products for your customers is that for both the variable rate type pricing as well as fixed rate pricing eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah gerard let me start our pricing schedules theres a lot of history behind them on the servicing fee side i would say that and we disclosed this in our q with some specificity but about half of the revenues earned through the servicing fee schedules are market level dependent so the kind of assets under custody levels theres then a portion that is driven by transactional or activity of volumes and then the balance is fixed so there is a mix and thats what youre seeing flowing through the pl at this point they are complex schedules you can measure them with a ruler in some cases just because they span the world they span products and regions and entities and often have some history associated with them but thats a broad basis ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah and then gerard just the second part of your question are we going at the assetbased fee the variable fee or the fixed fee i mean its a little bit of both and again were trying to be reasonable firstly to our clients state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 but also to ourselves and really tying this to where theres real inflationary pressures and also recognizing that we have a commitment to generating really good service for our clients right service better than our competitors so its less about is it the variable or the fixed its where are we having these pressures and therefore where do we need a price increase gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just as a quick followup eric in the heldtomaturity portfolio the duration was years as you pointed out can you share with us the oci accretion back into capital about how many basis points a year do you think youll see in that and then second whats the average yield of that htm portfolio today thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure let me do that in pieces in the htm portfolio i think theres good data for you and others in the financial addendum and you can find that on page of our addendum we describe the afs portfolio both on average and on an endofperiod basis in the htm portfolio and i think in total the yield on afs right now is about basis points on the heldtomaturity about basis points and thats just because of the duration that we tend to put in heldtomaturity to protect it from oci in terms of the accretion that will come through we expect the accretion to start towards the fourth quarter in particular a little bit in the third and then into the fourth quarter and were looking at accretion in the million to million range of capital it will bounce around quarterbyquarter as different maturities come through but thats a healthy amount of capital accretion and that could be worth basis points basis points of capital and could certainly help us fund future buybacks and other returns of capital to shareholders which as weve said wed like to restart in the fourth quarter and continue on from there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure operator your next question comes from mike mayo of wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi first thanks for changing the time of your conference call given so much else happening today so on the pricing due to inflation i mean it all makes sense its all logical but can you actually get that done weve talked about pricing going down for the last three decades now it seems like you have more of a reason to increase pricing than ever before ron youve been on the other side of this youre getting the phone call hi this is state street wed like to increase the pricing by and then youre like well were going to go to these other three or four or five state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 providers so how much confidence do you have that you can pass on some of these price increases to your customers ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thats a good question mike i would say that whats changed over the years is virtually everybody you go back years ago virtually everybody bought the same service it was custody fund accounting it was publicly listed markets it was fairly consistent and plain and it was very easy to do as you said i think whats changed is that even certainly in the medium to large managers youre seeing a broad product base some of which are actually reasonably complicated to do whether its complicated because of the skills required complicated because of the technology thats required and its in those areas where were seeing the highest inflationary pressures and we think that we offer a superior capability we think that in many cases theres just limited capacity in the marketplace and we also think that its a time that everybody is seeing the same kind of pressure the last years the worlds been enjoying in effect the great deflation and thats not whats going on now so its always dangerous to utter those words this time is different so i wont but we do think theres a set of circumstances in a targeted set of areas where pricing adjustments are required and that we believe that clients will understand and again very early reads but they seem to be mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and as a compromise are you talking more about compensating deposit balances like the trust banks had in the past when rates were higher ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp no mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay its just kind of we want to get paid more because our costs are up for us and everybody else and so one third eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp wait wait wait mike thats on deposits remember weve been underearning on deposits against what caused us to hold deposits which is preferred securities right for now several years we barely offset that at the height of the last interest rate increase in and and so were just trying to get to par on deposit spreads and obviously as deposit rates rise we give a reasonable proportion of that back to our clients and we do that purposely thats part of the social contract but that feels like its going back to a normalized level the wage and salary and noncomp pressures that were seeing are not different than what others are seeing in the rest of the economy and that on a net basis is quite different state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good clarification thank you and then just last on that your costs going higher i thought a lot of banks seem to have an advantage just like you you had billion of expenses billion in comp but comp and society is going up less than other inflation right like food rent gas everything else is going up a lot more than employee costs and what weve been hearing at least anecdotally among the banks is that some of those employee cost pressures have been waning in the most recent months and weeks but what i hear from you is that thats not the case or even if it is the case youre still talking about kind of historical growth than in the past ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp mike what i would say is what you say about comp costs lagging behind other inflationary expenses i mean that is true and thats typical right thats typically how kind of inflation works its way into and through labor markets i would say that weve certainly seen a much higher than trend pressure on us and i would venture since were swimming in the same pool of skills here i would say certainly with our nearing competitors particularly in the skilled areas that we need and as eric noted in some of the when were replacing somebody thats come in at a much or a significantly higher cost than before now i think its also true that if you believe that theres a recession facing us or that in any event there will be less kind of economic growth going forward than what we see now for a period of time thats likely to take pressure off it but theres still a very real move up in select areas around our expenses and i actually dont think it would be different for a comparable institution mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you very much operator your next question comes from rob wildhack of autonomous research please go ahead robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research hi ron hi eric just a quick one for me i wanted to ask about the drop in rwas in the quarter could you talk about what the drivers are there and what kind of rwa outlook or assumption is embedded in your guidance going forward eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah as you recall rob weve had in the first quarter consciously deployed more rwa in some of our business activities in particular in trading and in lending just because we had a surplus amount of capital and so we put it to work and had some good revenues this quarter were ph writing that back in partly because we were we were committed to driving our capital ratios upward and partly to be honest weve found some opportunities for optimization so i talked about more than a billion reduction quarteronquarter that came across businesses in securities finance that came in the lending book where some of the loans qualified for margin loan treatment state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 which comes at a different rwa level and then we had some amount of credit ill call it sort of credit light in the investment portfolio that was riskweighted that we allowed to roll off so there were some tactical adjustments that we made on that basis we also tend to have some volatility in rwa the fx derivatives book can move around by billion billion we got a good balance there so i think about athird id say was of the billion to billion quarteronquarter reduction was a good balance and well take those but actually that billion to billion could bounce back up in the third quarter and were obviously considering that we continue to accrete through the pl every quarter and i think were quite comfortable with our capital ratio trajectory into the third quarter and also in such a way that we can prepare for buybacks in the fourth quarter as well robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research very helpful thank you eric eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure operator your next question comes from vivek juneja of jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks firstly i want to echo mikes comments that about changing the timing of the call im glad i would take that one step further and say in the future it will be helpful if youd even think of another day so it will be not on such a crazy day for all of us so we can actually pay a little more attention to it but moving past that the price increases that youre talking about on the servicing contracts given that these are longerduration contracts ron when should we expect that they could start to go through is it a year out or do you think you could actually go these could go into effect in a fairly short order what kind of timing would you point to ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah its a good question and again because were trying to be very factbased and tie it to where theres increases and where we feel we need to do this the answer is it varies in some cases its around particular transactions or asset class types where we can institute in other cases there is an agreement that we need to secure from the client but our goal is to i mean obviously the pressure is now so we want to put it in as soon as possible again were early in this process so well see what we accomplished in terms of overall timing but i think given our approach which again is based on facts and the realities of client situations were optimistic that we can accomplish something here vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2022 operator there are no further questions from the phone lines at this time ill turn the conference back over to mr ron ohanley for
