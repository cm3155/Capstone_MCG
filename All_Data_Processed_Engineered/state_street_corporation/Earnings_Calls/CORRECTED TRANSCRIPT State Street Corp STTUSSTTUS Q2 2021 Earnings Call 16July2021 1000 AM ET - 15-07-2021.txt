meaningful progress we are making towards achieving our mediumterm targets as we continue to execute on the multiyear strategic pivot of our business to that of an enterprise outsourced solutions provider i am particularly pleased with our results as quarterly total fee revenue exceeded billion for the first time in the companys history we delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of servicing fee growth with servicing fees at the highest level in three years propelled by both strong equity markets and the impact of our actions to strengthen relationship management and sales effectiveness we continue to differentiate state street through our unique product and operational capabilities as well as through delivering enhanced client service quality our pipeline continues to deliver as evidenced by another strong another quarter of strong servicing and alpha client mandates which i will discuss shortly state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 additionally we continue to invest in our business and innovate across the franchise to drive growth and enduring shareholder value creation for example we announced the formation of state street digital in the second quarter a new division focused on addressing the industrys evolving shift to digital finance both as product offerings and as a business model this is just one example in a long history of innovation that state street has and is continuing to drive within our industry we also continue to develop state street alpha our fronttoback offering this unique capability has created an attractive value proposition that is resonating with both new and existing clients as well as contributing to client retention and growth opportunities which i will also discuss shortly turning to slide i will review our second quarter highlights before handing the call over to eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail second quarter eps was or excluding notable items despite the impact of our of interest rates on our nii earnings per share exnotables reached the highest level since when quarterly nii was notably higher more than more than it was in relative to the year ago period quarterly total fee revenue exceeded billion for the first time increasing yearoveryear driven by solid servicing and management fee growth which increased and yearover year respectively as well as better securities finance results the strong performance was partially offset by the yearoveryear impact on total revenues from lower software and processing fees continued moderation of fx market volatility and ongoing interest rate headwinds even with record quarterly fee revenue expenses were well controlled while second quarter total expenses were up relative to the year ago period they were down almost percentage point yearoveryear excluding notable items and currency translation as our productivity improvements continue to yield results we have created a culture of expense discipline over the last two and half years and we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs over the remainder of our strong fee revenue performance coupled with continued cost discipline delivered a 200basispoint improvement toward pretax margin yearoveryear which reached nearly in the second quarter excluding notable items further return on equity was or excluding notable items in the second quarter auca increased to a record trillion at quarter end supported by higher periodend equity market levels and new business onboardings new asset servicing wins increased to trillion for the quarter including the large alpha mandate with invesco announced in april we reported two new alpha wins in the second quarter taking the total number of alpha clients to after the second quarter close we also entered into an alpha mandate with legal general while invesco is an example of how alpha is helping to expand and deepen existing client relationships the legal general win demonstrates how the alpha strategy is also helping us forge new client relationships with the worlds most sophisticated investors our experience todate gives us confidence that alpha relationships will drive stronger retention rates for existing clients while also allowing us to broaden and deepen those relationships as we add additional products and services to these existing mandates additionally we are signing alpha clients that are new to state street demonstrating that alpha is enabling us to reach new clients and deliver front middle and back office services in a differentiated manner state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 we also created new relationships to help drive revenue growth across client segments and regions for example earlier this week we announced a new strategic alliance with first abu dhabi bank the alliance will create a fullservice enterprise offering for institutional investors in the middle east and north africa region it will provide investors with extensive reach into more than markets around the world clients will have access to state streets full suite of front middle and back office capabilities in addition to our extensive data management and analytics solutions which seamlessly integrates with first abu dhabi banks regional suite of security services products local expertise and regional direct custody network at crd annual recurring revenue increased yearoveryear to million and we remain pleased with how the business is performing while also enabling and propelling our alpha strategy global advisors continued to demonstrate strong performance aum increased to trillion and management fees increased to million both records benefiting from strong second quarter flows of billion across the etf institutional and cash businesses as we continue to leverage the strengths of our asset management franchise in etfs our lowcost and sector funds as well as our esg and commodity products continue to enjoy good market share with lowcost etfs expanding share in the second quarter and in institutional our sales force and relationship management realignment coupled with a strong product set led to good revenue growth turning to our balance sheet and capital we returned over million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter inclusive of million of common share repurchases consistent with the limit set by the federal reserve i am pleased with yet another strong performance under this years annual stress test the new scb framework provides us with additional flexibility to manage our capital base as examples yesterday we announced that our board of directors has approved a increase of our third quarter common dividend to per share and authorized a common share repurchase program of up to billion during the third quarter of through the fourth quarter of to conclude we had a very strong quarter business momentum is building and we have demonstrate a meaningful progress towards our mediumterm financial targets as i look ahead to support our strategic vision and help us achieve those targets we are continuing to prioritize improvement in our fee revenue growth while controlling costs by transforming the way we work in building a higherperforming organization for the future and with that let me turn it over to eric to take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone ill begin my review of our second quarter results on slide we reported eps of or excluding the positive impact of notable items which was driven by a previously announced sale of the majority stake in a legacy business on the left panel of the slide you can see strong results as we continued to drive fee revenue growth while controlling expenses we delivered pretax margin expansion and solid earnings growth as a result of the weaker dollar relative to the year ago period we continue to show our yearonyear results excluding the impact of currency translation in the right column we also show results excluding notable items on the bottom of the slide state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 turning to slide youll see our business volume growth periodend auca increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter to a record trillion both the yearonyear and quarteronquarter increases were largely driven by higher periodend market levels net new business growth and client flows at global advisors aum increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter to trillion also a record the yearonyear and quarteronquarter increases were both primarily driven by higher periodend market levels coupled with net inflows turning to slide you can see another quarter of strong business momentum second quarter servicing fees increased yearonyear including currency translation which was worth approximately percentage points yearonyear the increase reflects higher average market levels positive net new business onboarded and client flows only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and the absence of elevated prioryear client activity auca wins totaled trillion in the second quarter substantially up from recent quarters primarily as a result of the large alpha client mandate announced last april that ron just mentioned auca won but yet to be installed also amounted to trillion at quarter end as we smoothly onboarded over billion of client assets this past quarter we remain focused rate and business growth across both client segments and regions this quarter we had strong growth in the emea region aided by our intense coverage efforts which now extend to approximately overall of our top clients we continue to estimate that we need at least trillion in growth auca wins annually in order to offset typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds and weve clearly exceeded that mark this year i will remind you that installations typically occur in phases and over time and deals will vary by fee and product mix at this time we expect the current won but yet to be installed auca will be converted over the coming to 24month time period with the associated revenue benefits beginning in and the majority occurring in as we said in june we are pleased with our pipeline and our momentum turning to slide second quarter management fees reached a record million up yearonyear inclusive of percentage point impact from currency translation and were up quarteronquarter resulting in an investment management pretax margin approaching both the yearonyear and quarteronquarter management fee performance benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong etf flows these benefits were only partially offset by the run rate impact from the previously reported idiosyncratic institutional client asset reallocation as well as about million of money market fee waivers this quarter while we previously estimated that money market fee waivers on our management fees could be approximately million per quarter as a result of the recent improvement in shortend rates following the june fomc meeting we now expect that they will be about million to million per quarter for the rest of the year which is about a third lower than we had previously expected global advisors recorded solid flows across institutional etfs and cash for the quarter with the total amount amounting to billion we have taken a number of actions to deliver growth in our longterm institutional and etf franchises which are driving this momentum as you can see on the bottomright of the slide turning to slide let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail within fx trading services we are pleased that we continue to generate strong client volumes which remain above prepandemic levels in state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 the second quarter relative to a strong second quarter in fx revenue fell yearonyear as declining fx market volatility compared to the covid environment last year more than offset higher client volumes fx revenue was down quarteronquarter driven by a moderation of client volumes from index rebalances experienced in the first quarter and lower market volatility our securities finance business recorded strong revenue growth with fees increasing yearonyear and quarteronquarter mainly as a result of higher enhanced custody and agency balances as client leverage rebounded finally second quarter software and processing fees were down yearonyear largely due to the absence of prioryear positive marktomarket adjustments software and processing fees increased quarteronquarter mainly as a result of higher crd revenues moving to slide id like to provide some further updates on our crd and alpha performance we delivered strong standalone crd results in the quarter primarily reflecting higher client renewals and episodic fee revenues the more durable saas and professional services revenues continued to grow nicely and were up yearonyear resulting in an increase in standalone annualized recurring revenue to million this quarter marks the threeyear anniversary since announcing the crd acquisition and were very pleased with how the business has performed were winning in part thanks to state streets brand and reputation and the benefit to clients of our integrated alpha offering on the bottomright of the slide we show some of the second quarter highlights from state street alpha mandates we reported two new alpha mandates during the second quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate well with clients notably since inception through to second quarter we now have five alpha client mandates that are live although alpha deals usually take somewhat longer to implement given the size and scope the payoff outweighs the longer implementation period as we are able to further expand share of wallet to generate attractive revenue growth rates and increase the contract lengths which can be up to years in length for alpha services that span the front and middle office turning to slide second quarter nii declined yearonyear mainly as a result of the effects of lower interest rate environment on our investment portfolio yields and sponsored member repo product these impacts were partially offset by balance sheet expansion driven by higher balances relative to the first quarter however nii was flat as lower investment portfolio yields and the impact of shortend rates were offset by further expansion of the investment portfolio and lending activity on the right side of the slide we show the growth of our average balance sheet during the second quarter total average deposits increased by billion in the second quarter or an increase of quarteronquarter reflecting the continued impact of the federal reserves expansionary monetary policy while we continue to remain mindful of oci risk in the current rate environment we tactically added about billion quarteronquarter to our investment portfolio a few months ago before the recent downdraft in rates we also increased our average loan balances by approximately quarteronquarter to over billion driven by higher utilization by asset managers and private equity capital call client we also have a number of initiatives in flight to reverse and reduce this recent deposit uptick that we saw during the quarter state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 turning to slide second quarter expenses excluding notable items increased yearonyear mainly driven by the weaker dollar excluding the impact of notable items and currency translation total expenses were down nearly percentage point yearonyear as productivity savings for the quarter more than offset higher revenue related expenses and targeted investments and client onboarding costs compared to on a line item basis and excluding notable items and the impact of currency translation compensation and employee benefit cost was flat as we reduced highcost location head count which offset higher medical costs as claims began to normalize to prepandemic levels information systems and communications were up due to continued investment in our technology estate transaction processing was up primarily driven by higher revenuerelated expenses for subcustody balances and market data costs occupancy was down reflecting benefits from our footprint optimization efforts and some timing benefits and other expenses were down primarily driven by lower than usual professional services fees relative to the first quarter expenses were primarily impacted by the absence of seasonal and deferred compensation reported in the first quarter so overall we are pleased with our continued ability to demonstrate expense discipline as we have effectively managed total expenses exnotables and currency down yearonyear in the second quarter while driving strong total fee revenue growth moving to slide on the right of the slide we show our capital highlights we are pleased with our performance under this years ccar with a calculated stress capital buffer well below the minimum resulting in a preliminary scb at that floor the new scb framework provides us with additional flexibility to deploy our cap base in a number of different ways including investment opportunities dividends and buybacks for example yesterday we announced a increase to our third quarter common dividend to per share and our board has authorized a common share repurchase program of up to billion from the third quarter of through yearend in addition were also pleased that the federal reserve has provided state street with one additional year until january to retain its current gsib surcharge of to the left of the slide we show the evolution of our cet1 and tier leverage ratios as you can see we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels in excess of the requirements as of quarter end our standardized cet1 ratio improved by basis points quarteronquarter to as we had expected and sits above the upper end of our to cet1 target range the improvement was driven by solid capital appreciation and we also managed down rwas despite balance sheet growth our tier leverage ratio remains well above the regulatory minimum but declined by basis points quarteron quarter to primarily as a result of the further increase in average client balances as the feds quantitative easing continues we continue to think that a tier leverage ratio in the as appropriate for our business model and we can operate at the lower end of this range for a number of quarters while we consciously limit and reduce client deposits and offer them a range of liquidity alternatives turning to slide in summary our quarterly performance demonstrates solid business momentum on our top line and the scale we are driving within our operating model total fee revenue was up almost yearonyear and exceeded billion for the first time with doubledigit growth in servicing and management fees despite the yearonyear headwind from the strong fx trading services result we had in the second quarter of last year during covid state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 our expenses remain well controlled as a result of our productivity program as a result we are able to drive pre tax margin and roe close to our mediumterm targets notwithstanding the low rate environment next id like to update you on our economic outlook for the remainder of the year and provide our current thinking regarding the third quarter outlook at a macro level our rate will be broadly aligned to the current forward rate curve and assumes that shortend rates remain low and there is some modest steepening to the yield curve were also assuming global equity markets will be relatively flat to quarter end for the rest of the year as well as continued normalization of fx market activity in terms of the third quarter of we expect overall fee revenue to be up to yearoveryear with servicing and management fees each expected to be up to yearoveryear this means full year fee guidance is likely to be better than the upper end of the full year range we previously provided regarding nii despite the recent flattening in the yield curve we have seen an increase in shortend market rates and we now expect a modestly improved quarterly nii range of million to million per quarter for the rest of the year assuming rates do not deteriorate and premium amortization continues to attenuate turning to expenses we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs we expect that third quarter expenses exnotable items will be flattish plus or minus percentage point yearoveryear in these fee and expense guides for include approximately point of currency translation yearoveryear on taxes we expect that the tax rate will be in the middle of our fullyear range of to and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thank you eric and with that operator we can now open the call for questions state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks very much ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to start off by talking a little bit about the fee guide that you just went through could you just give us a sense as to the major drivers i mean i realize that throughout the call you were talking about the pipelines up youve got a reinvigorated sales effort going on is that whats driving this so quickly or is there something else thats happening that leads you to the fee guide raise thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah betsy why dont i start and eric will come in i mean its i wouldnt describe it as so quickly i mean what youre seeing here is the product of a lot of months and years of work thats now coming together and starting to bear fruit so and not that we were done we have more work to do but i think really it is about some of the things that weve told you in the past that weve been up to that are coming together and starting to have the desired impact here betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and then maybe you could just refresh how youre thinking about the asset management business and where you would like to lean into growth what pockets youre looking to invest in and if thats by geography too that would be helpful ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah i mean they we think of the business as having three core elements to it the etf business the institutional business and the cash business and both are wellestablished franchises the areas that wed like to lean into are the institutional business first and ill come back to the etf business but the institutional business has very strong client relationships around the world but a limited product set so what weve spent a lot of time thinking about is how do we take those relationships in that distribution channel and leverage it in some way through enhancing our product capabilities state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 on the etf side we have been on a long path to developing the product set there as well as deepening our presence in geographies outside the us youve seen a lot of payoff from that particularly in emea well continue to grow that areas of growth include esg which for us continues to do very nicely as well as just continuing to emphasize the advantages of our core product set it was its an institutionally designed product set it has a lot of liquidity to it and liquidity is important to many investors so its emphasizing what we have there and then the cash business is obviously its a function of interest rates but we have a very sophisticated cash business that works in different interest rate environments and well continue to present that to both existing asset management and asset servicing clients as well as clients that dont have either of those relationships with us betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks ron thanks eric operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hi brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for hey how are you ron how are you eric so another followup on the updated outlook i noticed eric that you said we are going to be above the upper end of the range for the full year which doesnt seem that challenging given how strong things were here in the second quarter and given how good looks at this point is it possible to narrow that full year fee revenue outlook to something more specific than just a greater than sign how are you thinking about it and should we think about it and then also what are your assumptions for balance sheet size embedded in the updated nii outlook thank you eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure brennan its eric let me describe it this way i think were seeing very good performance across a number of our businesses in addition to some of the tailwinds that you get from equity markets and i think its a combination of both equity markets were up globally quarteronquarter so that gives us another step up for servicing and management fee businesses but in addition i think what we are seeing is strength in net new business revenues last quarter i said we were relatively neutral in net new business and servicing fees this quarter were nicely positive on that front on the servicing fees side in management fees weve been booking a couple quarters here in a row of very nice inflows that come with annualized net new revenues that are solidly positive and create a tailwind as well and then you saw weve had good performance across our sec lending franchise crd had another good quarter and so were comfortable with a higher guide i think i gave you primarily third quarter information and then maybe just to try to answer the question directly the full year fee guide if you recall was taken up last state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 quarter to to yearoveryear remember that includes lapping ourselves from the covid bump from fx a year ago so our guide had been to for total fee growth and i think now you can count on around growth so were going to go from that range to about another point up over the top end of that range for the time being given what we know today brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thats fair and the balance sheet size piece of the nii eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah the balance sheets always has puts and takes and ins and outs in this environment of quantitative easing and what youve seen us do is weve try to put some of the additional deposits to work youve seen us take advantage of the increase in ioer and the fed floor on the on repo rates so thats been constructive we do need to manage also the size of the balance sheet because as we compress the balance sheet that frees up leverage ratio capacity and then that feeds back into our ability to return capital and so we are pretty serious about compressing some of those deposits we had more of an uptick in may and june april was kind of in roughly in line with the first quarter and so were starting to chip away at that and we see a path to do that i dont think thatll have much of an effect on nii remember at these low rates deposits when you the incremental deposit is worth a little bit but not a lot but it will be the right way to manage the balance of nii which i think will comfortably sit in that new range that we provided while also freeing up space for capital return which is an important priority for us brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for providing that clarification eric you also in your prepared remarks mentioned that fee rates vary when you think about the nice uptick in your won but not funded mandates here what did those fee dynamics look like how should we think when were starting to think about modeling building those out from here are those is does the success of alpha that youve had and charles river which we saw in the results today does that help support the fee rates for the businesses that youre looking or is the competition just still so intense that thats just too optimistic how should we think about those those fees that are oncoming thank you eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure brennan its eric again i think theres a real range here what you tend to get its not whether its alpha deals or classic cuts in accounting deals its really the size of the deals tend to come at different fee rates and so we saw some larger deals this quarter and because its the denominator of assets is larger well come a little lighter in terms of fee rate on the other hand in first quarter we had a set of wins that were well above our traditional fee rate and so you kind of have a number of combinations and what were always doing is on a profitability basis and a incremental basis always making sure that as we add revenues we do it at healthy margins we use it as a way to control state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 our costs and be disciplined and so i think fee rates will bounce around for wins in one quarter versus the next but were actually quite pleased with the fee rate for the first half of the year as well in line with our overall fee rate for the company and that bodes well as we leg into and implement some of these new wins brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning eric and ron just wanted to ask a little bit more on the capital return just in terms of how you land on the billion number visavis your balance sheet potential uses and also your capital ratio targets are you aiming for a total return payout haw are you under this new scb how do you kind of land on that number and how should we be thinking about whether theres would be potentially more room depending on some of those other factors thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp ken its eric there are always facts and circumstances on individual capital return at any time and place but let me give you the kind of the envelope on how we think about it from our standpoint about whats possible and what wed like to do knowing that theres always that they always have to manage to the individually to the quarters but the scb does give us some flexibility so let me do it in the following way one of the things we start with is what is our cet1 ratio and you saw we put in the first thing you can do is compare that to whats the target range to you can say look first step is how do we float down that ratio to the midpoint of that range and that provides million million of capital return capacity so thats one piece secondly you go through earnings earnings next quarter the quarter after you guys all have projections of earnings and what we do with those earnings is say how do we give out earnings back to shareholders in the form of capital return so one part of that is the dividend and then the balance of the earnings can often be returned as buybacks so thats an intention we often have so you can add those buybacks that cover the difference between earnings and dividends for the next two three four five six quarters because we gave you kind of a sixquarter view and then finally the one thing you have to keep in mind is the balance sheet always grows a bit not at the same intensity that a lendingoriented bank does but our balance sheet might grow riskweighted assets by so theres kind of a theres always a bit of capital retention thats necessary just to fund on a billion of rwa you always need to retain maybe million typically in a year of capital to hold against that state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 so if you go through those pieces its literally the down the floating down its the what earnings can support net of the dividend goes into buybacks and then its the modest amount of retention you need for some good underlying growth which i think pencils out to that up to billion range kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks for that color second question just on your nii guide and the range you mentioned that premium am would continue to attenuate was wondering you can if you can help us understand how much attenuation would you expect and where was it this quarter versus some of the other factors that are kind of working against it to kind of keep us in the zone thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah premium amortization actually is a bit bouncy from one quarter to the next just given kind of where you are with individual bonds and so forth but whats happening is youve got the grind on the investment portfolio which can be in the million to million range and then premium amortization can work in the opposite direction in the upcoming quarters were thinking its in the million range but itll bounce around and so you kind of have this headwind of rates just floating through premium amortization going the other way but it can bounce around plusminus million easily from one quarter to the next and thats the kind of thing we just want to be careful of what is nice is were starting to get to a levelingoff of the net yields on the portfolios rolloffs are starting to get better matched with rollons i think thats a good word to use rolloff and rollon of bonds and so you saw that we printed net yield of in the investment portfolio of about were pretty close to the bottom of that yield and thats what gives us comfort that were in this range for the time being though as you could see from my prepared remarks we took the that the upper end of that range up a bit just because of the improvement in frontend rates kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood okay thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator your next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello there ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hi glenn state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi so its good hello there so its good to see the margin back to the range and if i listened not too carefully i hear good market good organic growth better commentary about fees nii and fee waivers and continue to control expenses so is the question is is the 30ish margin here to stay for now because it sounds like everythings moving in the right direction right now eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp i think glenn its eric i think here to stay is a pretty definitive term i think what you can see is a solid progression over time in our margin and while one quarter doesnt make a year or doesnt isnt the intention that we have i think you can see progress i think you can see progress over quarters you can see progress over years i think there was a time when we would have taken the equity market tailwind and years ago you would have seen expenses creep up a lot more than they did this quarter and so i think youre seeing a discipline thats pushing margin in the right direction and i think were pleased with our performance wed like to do it again and again but thats the i think the focus and the intensity we bring but good results i think right direction and we as ron said in some of his remarks this has taken quarters and years to get to this point but we need to keep at it to consistently deliver this kind of result ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah glenn what i would add too is as you know margin is a part of our mediumterm targets we laid out those targets at a time when there was a very different nii picture so its taking longer than we would have liked but its very much part of what we said we were going to deliver its built into management compensation so i think that you should expect as much intensity around it tomorrow as youve seen up to now glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate that just one quick followup on first abu dhabi i just want to understand is this eventually replacing outsourcing global custody in the region is there a broader mandate i wonder if you could expand on what you expect or hope out of the relationship ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yes so i mean weve talked in the past about our intensified efforts in the middle east i mean weve been there for a while but weve taken a number of steps to augment our presence there weve got ph full licenses or weve got licenses now in saudi arabia think of first abu dhabi as doing two things one we become the global custodian for their client base two they become our subcustodian in regions where in parts of that region where we dont have local custody so replace other subcustodians in our network glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi how quickly can that happen based on ph current custodial piece state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp i mean its starting now i mean well start obviously theres contracts that need to move and things like that but itll happen pretty quickly over months and a couple of quarters not years glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi excellent thank you for all that appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody happy friday was hoping to get a couple of questions on crd i guess one can we get an update on the uninstalled revenue backlog million whats the typical timeframe of those installations and when it comes to new bookings the million any color you guys could provide around client types and service types that are embedded with the million would be helpful and then i guess just a numeric question i dont sorry if i missed it eric did you guys mention the episodic benefit how much that contributed to the quarter in crd specifically eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure alex its eric let me touch on each of those because were real pleased with the crd performance both in terms of this quarters wins the backlog i think the momentum and obviously how it contributes to the broader state street whole just to take through the new bookings million for the quarter was a fivequarter high some of that i think you can easily ascribe to the invesco win which was front office middle office back office as we continue to expand that relationship and youd have within the million the front office piece of that win on the uninstalled backlog the million its a mix of installations that come over six months months months and in some cases months what i will remind you is that the longer installations tend to come with professional services fees as you prepare and do those implementations the classic in the classic software sense those get reimbursed and paid as part of many of the contracts until you get to the golive period which in some cases theyre short for smaller installations in other cases takes longer just given the size and complexity of what were onboarding and then i think finally you asked about the total revenues the onpremise revenues were hit a high of another high just like a year ago coincidently of million some of that was the classic reupping of installations and that renew from threeyearold contracts fiveyearold contracts that kind of stuff i think some of the most episodic items in there are probably in the million to million range so id just encourage you guys to take an average of quarters over five quarters nine quarters that kind of thing and that will give you a better sense for whats typical in that onpremise line but maybe thats enough to start with state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yes that makes sense and then just a quick followup around capital and just a followup to kens question earlier the fact that you guys are a little bit below the low end of your target on tier leverage it sounds like theres room to manage those deposits out over time how does that inform just the pace of buyback from your the billion that you guys got authorized last night should we think of that evenly spread out through the end of or a little bit more backend loaded as you guys work through the balance sheet dynamics eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah thats a fair question because weve got to balance a number of different factors id tell you on tier leverage were comfortable operating in the and this is a right way risk if you think about it weve got a influx of deposits theyre held at the safest place in the world the fed and the central banks and so were not particularly exercised that bumping that to bumping at or even down a bit from the lower end of that range so thats fine as long as we have plans over time that we can execute and we do have those plans thats what we do for a living and as i mentioned weve got actions in place some of those deposits came in a little heavier in may and june weve got a set for example of ongoing client discussions a mix of commitments and ongoing discussions for example around billion of those that are literally happening that have happened last week this week and so there are ways for us to chip away at that in terms of the buyback patterning while its always dependent on facts and circumstances and exactly whats going on at any point in time we dont have an interest in backloading buybacks necessarily like wed rather do them relatively smoothly again all else being equal and we think we have plenty of capacity given our higher levels of capital ratios and our strength and the confidence we have on our deposit management efforts to deliver those in a relatively consistent way and in a way i think that shareholders would appreciate alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc awesome thanks very much eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning folks just want to come back to the balance sheet one more time in terms of the size and how youre managing that i dont know if i missed it for the million to million quarterly guide whats embedded in the size of the balance sheet given that it did spike up in the second quarter if thats if your expectation is for that to moderate state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 and then longer term over the next six quarters in conjunction with the billion buyback you mentioned obviously keeping capital for balance sheet side so maybe if you could give us some thoughts around whether your plan is within that buyback expectation to continue to grow the balance sheet on a yearoveryear basis and how that contrasts with the comments about trying to reduce the excess deposits on the balance sheet eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure brian its eric there are couple of factors in there that both get at a total balance sheet and then the risk weighted asset content of the balance sheet i think ive distinguished those two let me just tackle your questions in order on the nii range of million to million per quarter for the next couple quarters that fully takes into account some of our deposit management efforts remember the incremental billion deposit doesnt earn us a ton these days and so thats been factored in to that range and the underlying reason that range has slowed up a little bit is the frontend rates have ticked up which was gratifying in terms of balance sheet growth we need to contain the size of the balance sheet in terms of size call it leverage assets right thats what we need to contain under the surface theres always some amount of healthy growth in riskweighted assets right because as we support our clients in the fx business or in the sec lending business or by lending to them we have to expand those modestly now on our balance sheet were a capitallight business weve got a we have rwas on our balance sheet that are in the billion range what i dont know theres a range of what those can grow but theyre not growing at a year they may be growing 5ish percent a year plus minus a couple points and so its kind of that level and when you grow rwas that amount youre not really adding to the leverage balance sheet the leverage balance sheet which connects with tier leverage is driven primarily with deposits and thats separable from the rwa kind of growth typically brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay got it thats clear and then just maybe just back to the abu dhabi relationship and as you said ron you expect that to start moving pretty quickly should we think about any impact to auca for state street and the asset servicing fees related to that or is it less material ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah brian i would say that i mean clearly it would our expectations will drive auca i think it will be a modest amount at the beginning it will also help us to continue to contain and manage our subcustody costs and maybe most importantly over the mediumterm given the relationships there it will help further our penetration in the region so i mean thats probably the most important reason to be doing it theyre just a terrific partner brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp the challenge that we often have and others have too is that there can be times when youve got subcustodians and you like them but youre competing with them in certain instances and in this case weve we now have a subcustodian that were not competing with brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc right right that makes sense okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start off eric maybe with a question on securities growth and or more specifically i guess related to the lcr you had strong deposit growth as you noted the lcr ratio is running a little bit tight at versus minimum i was hoping if you can just give us some sense philosophically how youre managing to lcr constraints and just given the poor qe liquidity treatment of qerelated deposit growth how does it impact your ability to deploy at higher yields and even just grow the securities growth book incrementally from here eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure steve its eric the lcr has some anomalies ill remind you of in the calculation between the allin corp lcr and the bank and the best way i can describe it is whats most pertinent to us as a institution the bank holding company is actually the bank lcr the bank lcr is at so its extremely flush and its got plenty of room what happens at the corp is that the additional deposits get haircut just because of transferability which is fine and what happens in the calculation because of how the numerator is factored in for that and the denominator im happy to put you in touch with our ir team to share with you some of the scenarios is that as we become more flush at the bank which is a good thing you have this odd result at the corporate holdco where the lcr goes down whats ironic is that if we were to begin to reduce deposits what happens mathematically is that the bank lcr starts to flow down from this very elevated and the corporate lcr actually floats up and i think its best to state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 probably have someone work through the algebra with you its just how the rules are configured theyre fine but were actually quite flush with lcr and are operating quite comfortably steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thanks for that color eric and the followup i had is just on expenses youve done a great job of indiscernible expense clearly in the guide reinforces a similar trend but there is some growing concern amongst investors just given many of the other large banks are guiding higher on expenses talking about accelerating investments i was hoping that you can might be able to give us some context on what the full year expense might look like for this year and even talk thinking through what the growth algorithm might look like heading into next year whether you might need to step up investments to keep up pace with peers ultimately eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure steve let me start expenses have been a focus for several years in a row now weve gotten expenses down exnotables and adjusted for currency down and last year and this year what weve said is that on a nominal basis we expect expenses on a full year basis to be flattish plus or minus basis point range and thats nominally and on an adjusted for currency basis and notables it would be down by about point obviously with a range around that and obviously the biggest thing that we wrestled through this year in particular is that there are revenuerelated costs that come through as weve mentioned some custody costs are often auca based market data costs are auca or aum based and so those are what were working through and why we have a range there and weve stuck with our weve stuck and are sticking with that range given what we know today i think the if i step back the hallmark of our approach to cost is that youve got to systematically have productivity programs in place that actually save not a little bit but save a good amount of cost right and i think we show you typically when we do our january call at the beginning of the year that were looking to take or percentage points of the expense base off through a set of productivity programs we and that on a base of billion or points is thats significant amounts thats hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue but were a scale business thats what we should be doing and then at the same time what were doing is reinvesting a portion of that not all of that but a portion of that in the underlying business and sometimes we invest by expanding coverage and sales forces sometimes we reinvest by expanding in product feature functionality sometimes we invest as we onboard clients right we have to we have some marginal costs that we have to add and were usually happy to do that because it comes with revenues on the other side of it and so our programmatic approach is to save sufficiently so that we can reinvest and well continue to do that now how those balance out weve given you a sense for how that balances out to down expenses in in it was down and this year we expect to be down as well again adjusted for notables and currency translation how that plays out were going to well keep working through its a little early to talk about next year but i think you can tell were pretty focused on this but obviously we do need to factor in revenuerelated costs and as equity markets continue to tick upwards then we have to factor that in and thats a little more of a feature of this year and maybe even upcoming time periods than it has been and so that is something that we have to work through but at least thats the broad approach state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color eric thanks so much for taking my questions eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning eric good morning ron ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc eric i eric can you i think you said on the call and im trying to get the transcript but i couldnt obtain it so i apologize i have to ask this question i think you said on the call that new business wins this quarter contributed positively i think you said maybe earnings versus last quarter it was neutral first of all could you clarify if it was earnings the second what was the changing dynamics between the two quarters that enabled this quarter to be a positive number versus last quarter it was neutral eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp gerard its eric the i think youve got a good memory and summary and let me just add the specifics as part of my prepared remarks on servicing fees right i was clear that a part of the increase on a yearonyear basis in servicing fees came from positive net new business so more wins installed than the usual modest amount of attrition that we get and that is in contrast if you you remember correctly last quarter i said new business net new business was neutral and i said we were not as pleased as wed like to be wed like it to be positive and its important for it to be positive and part of what youre seeing is i think that over the last couple of quarters weve accelerated our wins and win rate you see a little bit of that in aucas but its bouncy right youve seen us put in place an installed business quickly in some cases so remember custody can get installed quickly when its won and so weve had some focus on some of those kinds of wins and those have come through and the intention here is how do you continue to sell and expand share of wallet with clients not just with the top as weve talked about but the next and the next and so i think what were starting to see is some of the effects of the or some of the results of that more intense coverage process some of which we presented at one of the conferences back in june is starting to take root in a more ill say a more consistent way that doesnt mean it will happen every quarter but were i think quite state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 pleased with this quarter and we see that its been building its been building the momentums been building in this regard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good then the followup question is on the alpha product and youre having obviously some success now in winning over new customers i guess within that area what percentage of your pool of customers you just referenced eric the top for example what percentage of your customers are you think would be interested in the alpha product and second when you talk to your customers about taking on alpha what are some of the challenges youve found to convince them that its really in their best interest to do it ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah gerard its ron why dont i take that i mean in theory i suppose wed say of them are eligible starting point really matters here the clients that have been weve now got experience under our belt through the end of the second quarter a whole lot more current conversations underway typically theres some kind of trigger point like a aging technology ineffective or excessively costly operation stack that triggers this the obstacles to it are severalfold right these are big change programs and typically the institutions that are going forward with it its not about a deputy head of operations has decided to come hire us its almost always at least driven from the cio and the coo meaning the chief investment officer and the chief operating officer and oftentimes its on the ceos agenda so when theres that kind of focus on it thats when these things tend to happen now just given whats going on and some of the trends in the asset management industry i mean the industrys buoyant now with some of the underlying trends in terms of aging technology real challenges around data management and how do you effectively use the data you have these issues are on the agenda of most ceos so its very few instances where theres not a conversation going on how it plays out will be different which is why we built the model the way it is meaning its interoperability well weve had different wins where in fact were interoperating with other front office systems to the extent that we need to such as aladdin and so weve tried to build this recognizing that these are very large sophisticated clients long histories lots of kind of software in their stacks and we want to make this work across a broad variety of clients gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good just as a quick followup on the share of wallet that you just referenced earlier eric have you guys found yet with the alpha customers that youre having better success in expanding the share of wallet once you get them onboarded and up and running than a traditional customer eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah gerard its eric thats exactly the result that were seeing because what were finding is not only do we expand up the up and down the value chain we add the front office the middle office in many cases and the back office but as you do that its much more natural to begin to say if youre going to add middle office and back office to begin to consolidate the custody for example in the relationship or to connect with the some of state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 the trading activity that we have because some of the trading activity can plug for example directly into charles river so thats the underlying benefit is the expanded share of wallet supplemented by these become even stickier relationships these become true partnerships as opposed to a service arrangement gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport research james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners hey good morning ron you noted that you want to lean into the institutional asset management business and this quarter was one of the best flow quarters in years so can you i guess one describe in more detail what youre doing on the sales and distribution side to drive the improved growth and i guess secondly when you talk about adding products and capabilities what areas would you look to add is that an organic effort or does that need to be acquisition just some help on that thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah i mean we what weve done is over the course of now a couple of years taken a very good sales and relationship management force and made it better we have the benefit in most of our instances because of the core passive products where if were in a client we tend to be if not the largest manager one of the largest which by definition gives you a seat at their table as they think about asset allocation those kinds of things so its been very systematically building out and upgrading our capability to have those conversations and provide those products and to products and to share of their wallet esg has been providing some real tailwind here weve got a long history in it weve got a strong reputation in it and weve been able to both have those conversations and shape a lot of asset allocation there in terms of products i mean its if you think about it its were we tend to dominate one end of the barbell so as you look out across the rest of the barbell almost anything would be eligible our focus is on now multi asset products and building some of those ourselves or creating them bespoke from for very large clients through product capabilities that we already have but the way were thinking about it conceptually is that we have a distinctive strength in terms of our institutional sales and client management capabilities and were thinking about how to do that we think theres an organic opportunity in terms of inorganic i mean those theyre hard to engineer right so if something comes along that makes sense for our clients and for our shareholders well certainly look at it but theres been plenty of organic that weve been able to do that youre now seeing in the results james mitchell q analyst seaport research partners all right great thats helpful thanks state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi in late you had around employees now you have employees so i was just wondering youre putting on more revenues without adding head count to what role has technology played into that and what are your expectations going forward and the big picture question is whats the state of your tech backbone in terms of how much are you on the cloud public cloud private cloud how much do you expect to remain were almost a decade later after state street first implemented this cloud it didnt go great last decade seems like its going better now so kind of an update on that and again tying that back to head count ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah mike its ron here in terms of your point about the leverage were getting out of the employee base id make a couple of points there that the composition of that also has changed too i mean we are continuing to leverage and utilize lowercost locations so youd find that the mix has changed over that period but youre raising actually the more important point which is technology and listen service productivity and its not just this service and its not just this firm service productivity has been elusive for a long time now and i think we and i suspect others are getting our arms around it a lot of it is automation a lot of it is taking and automation in services its not the quite same thing as you envision an automobile assembly line with lots of moving mechanical arms it tends to be youre taking many many tasks that constitute a job and automating those such that whats remaining in the job is higher valueadded and those things where you need judgment were getting better and better at instituting that we also mike are and weve talked about this in other context were spending a lot of time on measuring productivity again manufacturers the good ones have had this down for a long time service companies its much newer weve got a significant percentage of our company now thats covered by productivity metrics and sometimes its the old hawthorne effect right you just now that theres a measure and youre seeing hey theres a difference between this group and that group and theyre pretty similarly situated and doing the same thing what can we learn from that and that is starting to drive some of that productivity on the technology side i stand by the team that we have its an outstanding team its making a lot of progress as you know in technology its some of it is about pure investment in new stuff and new capabilities and thats part of the investment that were making a lot of it is around continuing to up our resilience this is an ongoing issue for the industry particularly in cyber as the cost to deal with that goes up and up and up and as a gsib we need to be at the lead and we want to be at the lead there but i think were making very good progress its showing up in the numbers again its the result not just of things that we did last quarter but of things that weve done now for many quarters and approaching years and theyre starting to payoff and youll see more payoff in the future mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 and just i found that very interesting the analogy you gave with the auto assembly line so when you automate a services business how much of that can you automate leaving the valueadded parts at the end and again on the head count question maybe you dont want to answer that one or maybe you dont know yet going ahead but those two followups please ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah i mean the youre asking the question and the first part of that next question youve asked which is how far can we go and we dont know that yet but we know theres a lot more we can do than weve done i mean think about the striking of a nav of a net asset value i mean theres a lot that goes into that and then theres a lot of reconciliation and checking that goes into that we are again as weve talked about in other forums were putting a lot of ai into that right to make that nav calculation not be this flurry at the end of the day that begins at and hopefully is done by but in fact is starting as soon as trading starts such that what youre doing at the end is really that final checking where you do need human intervention so and mike what was your question on people did i miss the question or head count mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes just no again i was trying to make the connection between technology and head count and maybe im forcing that connection but your head counts been flat your revenues look like theyre going higher you talked about backlogs installation intense coverage process do you expect head count to start going up again given those initiatives and the backlogs ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp i think what you should expect to see from us is a breaking of the relationship that occurred in the past which is that head count and compensationrelated costs went up kind of at the same level as revenue did what this really is about is just getting more scale and scale effect out of our system and in the past some of our challenge has been that we tend to deal with the most sophisticated clients highest demanding they pay us a lot of money so their demands are justified but weve gotten much better about getting scale easing out of those relationships and those operations and you should expect us to continue to do that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of rob wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp good morning guys state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hi rob robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp just another question on crd you guys did a nice job highlighting some of the drivers of this quarters results wondering if you could comment on the trajectory of the softwareenabled and professional services pieces do you think the growth that we saw this quarter is sustainable eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp rob its eric that certainly is sustainable i think the what wed actually like to do and youve seen in different quarters if you go back the last few earnings releases is that the combination of professional services and softwareenabled revenue has actually grown nicely in the doubledigits not in some cases closer to and because whats happening is two things one is youve got takeup in the market for new installations and i think weve described in the past the number of saas clients for example is up but you also have a over time conversion from onpremise to saas because clients are realizing the value of a cloud offering a more standardized cloud offering it still has to connect with their the rest of their estate where they can then get upgrades and the new feature functionality that we roll out on a regular basis so thats a that component of the professional services and softwareenabled set of revenues in charles river i think are going to be in the mid to in the doubledigit teens typically itll just bounce around a little bit with professional services but thats a real thats the i think thats the future of the franchise is in those areas ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp rob what i would add to that is much of the investment that weve or one of the key investments weve put into crd was in fact enhancing but not overhauling the cloud offering weve migrated that to the microsoft azure platform its now being installed in clients it gives a whole a combination of more standardization but as eric noted more flexibility for clients that have unique needs and particularly as you get outside the united states theres very particular desires on where the data is located and azure is giving us that ability to basically be flexible on that in terms of data location which is should its basically a more robust saas offering than charles river had when we bought it robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp got it and maybe relatedly i did want to ask about profitability in crd do you think that youre starting to see signs of scale in that business and then what do you think about the longerterm profitability or margin profile of the business going forward eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 rob its eric yeah we are getting to that point i think we bought charles river three years ago as we said we announced the deal and in the first year or two we needed to reinvest in the platform that was part of our deal modeling it was part of what we thought would lift revenue top line revenue from what was single digits into the low doubledigits on average weve said and so we did need to reinvest last year and this year but i think were starting to get to the point where its got now the scale and the functionality it should have where it can where we can really deliver earnings growth over time and take advantage of the momentum and the takeup that weve seen in this business ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp rob and theres been two id categorize the investments in charles river in two broad categories one is what you would have expected us to do or for that matter probably any other buyer which was okay were going to enhance the offering here for charles river and its historic established core business the second category of investment has been related to the whole alpha platform and making charles river an integral part of that enabling the kind of connectivity that eric was talking about earlier connectivity to other parts of state street connectivity if you think about charles river is the front to the middle and the back and thats been theres been a lot of investment there and also a lot of development thats come out of that i mean its not like nothing has popped out some of theres been quite a bit thats been completed and implemented and we think were kind of at the peak of that and that that should start to flatten and then decline robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp got it thank you guys operator and your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi a couple of questions for both of you ron and eric firstly ron you mentioned you have a wider you talked about the products in the asset management side where does active stand in equity stand in your mind given that that has been stuck for the last four quarters it hasnt really moved despite the strong markets is that still something you want to be in do you exit or whats your thinking there i know its small so that but given your comment about youve got a wide window ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah its small and much of our active equity also tends to be in the value space right which has vivek has not yet seen its enduring day in the sun but we do believe that active will play a part and should play a part in portfolios we actually think that the move to active etfs will help propel that it will provide a different vehicle to construct portfolios with so we view this institutional relationship management channel as one again given the nature of the people and the nature of the relationships as one that can accommodate a broad set of products including active equity state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and would that really need an acquisition to again sort of make a material impact on that or ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp again were focused with the organic agendas pretty full in terms of products at this point and thats where our focus will be i just hate to speculate about inorganic because thats all that it would be it would be speculation again to the extent to which something came along that made sense for our clients and for our shareholders wed certainly take a close look at it vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and last completely separate question if i may the big win with someone like invesco huge existing client already what is given that theyre already a large client what is the incremental services and therefore the incremental fee revenue from that the trillion sounds big but how should we think about given that they are an existing client alpha is that did you add middle office and front office i mean can you give us some perspective of how meaningful that kind of a win is ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah it is a large client but we certainly are not the only servicer of them so i would think about the services there in a few buckets firstly some back office which actually transitioned over before we even announced the win additional back office secondly is front office in terms of charles river which will be the core operating platform for them and then thirdly middle office as you noted so its really across the board and again this is us partnering with them to help them achieve what theyre trying to in terms of their technology and operation stack because we do have a longstanding relationship with them theyve also partnered with us in terms of developing helping us develop new features and functionality into the alpha platform that will be extendable to other clients in the future vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and i guess the middle office would probably come a little bit longer time to get installs as it normally does ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp right right vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you both ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thanks state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 operator and there are no
