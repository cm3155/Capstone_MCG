the ir section of our website in addition todays presentation will contain forwardlooking statements actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our sec filings including the risk factors in our we said it was worth about of fees as of the december point that we just crossed its now about of fees and ill let you sort of build it from there but its included in our forecast it will continue to be included in our forecast we think about net new business right weve got to a sound we always have a bit of attrition and well we want to continue to be net ahead and as youve seen us in the last couple years weve been net positive with net organic growth broadly and then with blackrock specifically they continue to be a very important client of ours we have continued and kept a good amount of business that we do with them were strong providers for them in alternatives which is growing quickly and weve also been awarded new business over the last year and so it will just i think it will just be part of the outlook that i give you as we go forward ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great thanks eric state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 operator thank you your next question comes from the line of alex blostein from goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning thanks for the question maybe just to followup on kens last point around servicing fees i guess if you take your run rate servicing fees at the end of the year it still implies a pretty wide gap versus where you guys expect to end for so maybe just provide a little bit more granularity where the ramp is going to come from so i know equity market is one thing and you guys are assuming i think 10ishpercent growth in global equity so that certainly helps but off of the kind of 48ishbillion run rate that you exited to get to i dont know billion thats a growth thats still wider than weve seen in the past so im just curious whether its new business or something else that you see on the horizon that will help you bridge that gap eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah alex if you i think i tend to spend a little more time on the full yeartofull year kind of servicing fees it sounds like youre modeling the last four quarters and then the next four quarters which obviously we model as well and we have in our budget its really a combination of factors right so there is if you start with fourth quarter of and then work forward we expect some appreciation in equity markets well see if that plays out and well obviously stay in touch with you all we think that will be a tailwind we think client flows and activity in particular should not be a headwind like it was in maybe neutral maybe a positive just as clients have adapted to this new environment and so we see the new year this new year as a time when theyre going to be trading investing building positions so well see if that plays out that will be part of it then we have net new business and so we do have a good pipeline both in the traditional servicing and alpha area and i think as part of that we continue to mine our existing client base because the share of wallet growth can be positive there and then finally theres always some amount of normal pricing headwinds but thats factored in but you kind of have to go through those four areas and remember were assuming some growth in equity markets on a pointtopoint basis but well see if that plays out alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got you all right thats helpful maybe just a followup around the balance sheet strategy i heard the nii guidance the deposit commentary all makes sense when it comes to the tailwinds from sort of repricing the fixed portfolio the fixed securities portfolio can you help us frame what the rollonrolloff dynamic looks like today and also whether or not there are some more opportunistic actions you guys might take like ive seen with both bk and northern over the last month or so with respect to just maybe reaccelerate some of the lower yielding securities roll off into something that might be a little more attractive here eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah let me describe it as follows the investment portfolio has an average duration of a bit over twoandahalf years so call it average maturity of five years and so you go through the math and that means about of it rolls onrolls off in a typical year it will move around a bit i think what we found and thats invested across the curve its invested in various currencies so theres a mix so you tend to get as you have rolloffrollon somewhere between sometimes tailwind for that particular quarter of the amounts that are rolling off and rolling on and so thats whats actually been one of the factors thats in billing the yields and the state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 yields improvement on the portfolio and both how it was designed and what were pleased to see so that will be a gentle tailwind assuming fiveyear rates stay more or less where they are and european rates continue to float up and so well just have to that will be one of the tailwinds that we see in terms of more dramatic action we obviously always think about what we might do what weve noticed is that if you have high riskweighted asset positions in your or riskweighted assetintensive positions in your portfolio then what happens you could take the loss you reinvest and it helps accelerate a buyback right thats why i think a number of players are doing that doing just the for vanilla instruments treasuries agencies governmentguaranteed securities theres i think the benefits are a little closer to a push we could take some losses through the pl theyre already in the equity account through aoci you put on nii in the future i think thats just moving around of the financials and we just dont find that thats a particularly compelling trade to do well always evaluate well also well see if we have specific positions that might need some adjustment but we dont see that as particularly compelling its not really compelling economically and the financial benefits you guys can kind of model out either way and so i think were pleased with the ability to continue to manage the portfolio in line with our current processes and theyve been ph numerous right the nii is up significantly this past year and up another next year and weve got a tailwind and it i think it bodes well for where we are and where were going alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah i got you great thanks so much eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure operator thank you your next question comes from the line of brian bedell from deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks and just on the net interest revenue outlook for eric can you talk a little bit about what you view as sensitivity to say if we had rate cuts in the back half of the year i dont think thats assumed in your outlook but just if you can talk about that dynamic and whether you think that would just be offset by reducing the deposit beta and then also on the foreign deposit beta that you talked about which is much better than us do you expect that to continue or do you see incremental foreign deposit betas moving higher from here eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah let me do it in reverse order the us versus foreign currency betas in our experience this cycle prior cycles do tend to run at different levels partly because the us has the structure of noninterestbearing versus interestbearing deposits right so the client deposit betas are in a subset of the total and partly because the international markets just operate a bit differently how were paid and how that how those expectations have been set over ill call it decades for the industry operate differently so i think for the as we look into the next few quarters we think the us client deposit betas ex any new money that we bring in on an initiative basis is state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 going to be in that to and the international betas we think will continue in the to range when you look at euros pound sterling canadian dollars aussie dollars and some of the other currencies so we think theyre kind of in the theyre going to be in this zone and that gives us some ability to continue to take advantage of the interest rate increases if i then work through the other part of your question what happens with rate cuts thats in our expectations right thats in the forward curves especially for the us that there could be a december cut theres some probability there could be a cut before that i think it doesnt dramatically affect because they are late in the year the rate cuts dont dramatically affect the nii forecast so well kind of take it as it goes i do think youre as youre intimating theres a bit of this offset which is if the fed is cutting rates and theres probably going to be even more cash that clients keep on hand and deposits in the system so therell probably be some offsetting impact and obviously with the us betas higher conveniently rate cuts actually at some point help with the with nii as well so i think theres a fair amount of theres a range of scenarios lets call it in the second half of next year and so my guess is brian were going to be having this conversation often with you and well certainly keep you posted as we see some of those scenarios develop or theres more variability brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc no thats super helpful and then just maybe on asset servicing just maybe an update on how youre seeing the pricing headwinds fold out for this year and also obviously you typically do get a pricing headwind just from a mix shift toward etf but maybe if you could talk about whether you think that might be offset by some of the growth in alternatives and then i know i think there is an expense offset to or i should say i believe the margin is the same on etfs versus say mutual funds so you get an expense offset maybe if you just want to confirm that eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah brian i think the pricing experience that were seeing in the industry has been stable and consistent over the last few years and we expect it to be consistent into next year and beyond we just have the standard because our contracts are tied to equity markets when they roll over every four five six years typically folks are thinking where they expect equity markets to be they know were going to get paid theyre going to pay us more in the coming years and they want to share some of that and so theres a partial pricing offset but its in the headwind per year on servicing fees and been relatively consistent ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah and brian its ron brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp the mutual fund to etf shift the i mean theres been some highprofile conversions of mutual funds to etfs but thats theres not a lot of that going on more typically what youre seeing is etfs being added to lines and state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 yes the economics are different the revenues fees are lower but also particularly when youre at scale like us the expenses are much lower so its not meaningful in this overall revenue guide that were giving you brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah perfect great thank you so much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions so id like to start on capital so the buyback sends a strong message ron very encouraging to hear about your comments on ma but i wanted to clarify the buyback is up to billion so does the upper end of the range there assume that youre going to see some aoci accretion and is the quarterly range of million to million still the right way to think about it if rates are stable eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brennan its eric the answer is yes and yes right if you think about it we forecasted just you guys just as you have earnings and coming to the pl aoci in that range of million to million a quarter it bounces around a little bit and it may with movements in rates but the pull to par has been good to us and will be a nice tailwind theres some normalization of rwas which i mentioned into the first quarter then there is some rwa growth in our plans because we want to continue to lend more to clients and support more with their foreign exchange or hedging activity so well continue to do that and then theres the buyback and our plan is just to at pace get back into our range and that authorization comfortably gets us there brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay excellent and then a couple folks have touched on it before but maybe if we think about the fee revenue can you please update us on the impact of market moves to fee revenues and whether or not theres also a corresponding impact on the expense side too id assume theres at least some degree of impact there thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah let me do it this way i think as weve been relatively consistent here and i think the guidance will hold a average change in lets call it an increase in equity markets right will typically lead to about a increase in servicing fees if you have both of those on average so thats the kind of gearing we have its higher on management fees higher equity and markets tend to be closer to a increase in management fees on the expense side if i it moves around a bit but i think its a average increase in equity markets probably close to lets say around the range around percentage point increase in expenses could be a little bit less it kind of depends but our subcustodian costs have a gearing towards equity markets and fixed income markets market data in some cases does as well so could be half a point could be a point and thats part of what we have in the expense walk and outlook that weve given and in some ways i think were actually pleased to see that particular expense increase because that particular expense increase comes with real revenue growth and that then delivers ebitda and earnings growth when you bring it altogether state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc excellent thank you for that color operator thank you your next question comes from the line of steven chubak from wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so eric i actually have a twoparter if youll indulge me just on some of the nii guidance first i was hoping you could provide just some guardrails on your assumptions for nib outflow given youre relatively close to the trough that we saw last cycle and for the second part just since you alluded to nii stabilizing beyond even as nib remixing pressures abate and reinvestment tailwinds start to work through the balance sheet was curious why nii isnt actually growing beyond is that a function of rate cuts international mix any perspective would be really helpful eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp all right well the crystal balling into i got to tell you we got a lot of variabilities playing out right now whether its economics whether its central banks and i think i know theres a lot of talk about whats happening in nii where do we go to and then does it what happens after we get to a peak so i was just trying in to kind of level set that we see stability theres a scenario where you see growth there are scenarios where we may not but its hard youre getting far out on our forecasting and predictions to be honest so lets come back to that maybe in the middle of the year that will be a good conversation in terms of noninterest bearing you saw noninterestbearing on average was about billion this quarter this quarter meaning fourth quarter it was down sequentially its bounced around quarterly but we see i dont know you could have off the billion you could have billion rotation out next quarter you could see that again into the next quarter then it starts to or it could be billion and then billion and so on and so forth so i think were at this level where weve seen some amount of rotation we think its going to continue roughly at the pace that its been going so it could be anywhere between billion billion and billion a quarter but you could have some changes to that what we do think is that well continue to see some of it in the first half of the year and then it just starts to slow down into the second half and what weve done is used that kind of base case into our modeling and its all factored into the increase in nii that we expect for next year steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great and in my defense eric since you did talk about stabilization i felt like i had to take advantage of that window of opportunity so look forward to talking about it a little bit more in the middle of the year just one more for me on capital management i was hoping you could just speak to or give us some insight into the cadence should we expect that buyback to be executed ratably or be a little bit more frontloaded here and just given the commitment or at least clearly like a strong effort to optimize your capital levels how are you scenario planning for the basel iv proposal or update that we should be getting from the fed early in state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah all fair and its a kind of discussion we have internally we want to frontload the buyback you saw us start particularly strong this past quarter and we want some amount of front loading on the other hand its actually quite stabilizing to the stock to have buybacks on a consistent basis so i think we dont want to front load at an extreme and we dont want to be ratably flat through the year at the extreme either because it gives i think its a good kind of market practice to have some ill call it front loading but reasonable consistency in the buyback as well i think then the goal is to get into our target range at pace and then wed love to operate in the middle of our range over time thats kind of how a range is set up but i think what we always have to do is look out on the horizon are the economic conditions worsening right and so then you may be want to run close to the upper end of the range to insulate and prepare or are they particularly benign and there are particularly good uses of capital then you might want to be at the lower end similarly i think well learn more about basel iii and some of the changes in capital rules maybe that comes with other changes in capital rules we dont know and i think later this year well evaluate and thats another reason to either run towards in different areas of the range as well so it all factors in but i think were quite comfortable with the direction where we want to go and then like you will well think about whats on the horizon and plan for that steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great thanks so much for taking my questions operator thank you your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good afternoon guys eric as a followup on the stock repurchase commentary did you guys and especially now and essentially youve referenced itd be more frontend loaded did you guys consider an accelerated share repurchase program eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp gerard we did and i think what the accelerated share repurchase program typically does is operate in such a way that the stock buybacks accelerate within the course of the quarter right within the threemonth period there are typically some benefits of that you tend to add around that eps its actually interesting in a high interest rate environment you also lose the nii benefit of the capital so weve actually found that the asrs tend to be a push roughly and so we often do a more typical buyback within the available trading days in the quarter in a way thats fairly market practice as a way to return the cash and the capital to all of you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 very good and then i know youve pointed to the rwa benefit you had this quarter for the cet1 ratio and i think you said in your slides your targeted range is to which of course youre above at this time do you have any guidance on when you think you may reach your targeted to cet1 range eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp it will depend on let me say it this way we want to return the capital at pace and ive given some bookends as to what that means and thats i think a forecast you guys can build off of and we want to get to our target range right we dont want to wait till i dont know next christmas right that would not be at pace in my nomenclature at the same time theres just a range of what well move if rwas lighten again it will take a little longer if they go back and we fully utilize our limits in our various businesses and areas then it might be a little more quickly so its hard to pin it down but as i said wed like to execute the buyback at pace wed like to get back into a range at pace and were driving in that direction gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate it thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well thanks for all the answers on the cyclical factors i just wanted to ask about the structural end game strategic end game post brown brothers and the reason i ask i count five restructurings in the last years they seem to come around like as often as the olympics the fourth quarter is yet one more quarter with notable items i count notable items in of the last quarters and i do get some of it like you have incredible headwinds mutual funds markets technical debt youve been reinventing yourself front to back straight through processing serving clients more agile tech and i also recognize what you said at the start that the roe and the margins improved for a couple of years in a row but when i look at fees their expenses that has gone the other way and it seems like maybe one root issue is fixed cost so really the question is a concrete question what percent of your expenses are fixed how does that compare to the past im assuming theyve come down and where would you like to take that and then more broadly what is the end game strategy after brown brothers thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah let me start on that mike theres a lot in there a comment on im not going to comment on past restructurings ill comment on this one right weve made some changes to the way we organize ourselves we talked about that back in the middle of the year and theres some benefits we can take out of that in terms of simplifying the management structure having a smaller number of senior managers were going to take advantage of that its consistent with simplifying our business it creates accountability and we stand by the need to have done that restructuring in terms of where do we take this business going forward it has a lot of benefits to it its very tied to investment markets over time investment markets grow they dont shrink so the actual if you will unit pricing while the state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 unit pricing may go down overall pricing actually overall revenue is actually more times than that have a tailwind we like that business its also one that is changing fundamentally from being a kind of a back office show me the lowest price kind of thing to much more of an enterprise outsourcing business we are very new in that were very early in that transition and we think by far we are the best positioned to take advantage of that in terms of the technical capabilities that we have the people capabilities that we have the position we have in the marketplace weve made initial inroads and wins in that but theres development that we talked about that will be delivered in and beyond but a lot of it in that will only help strengthen our position so we see the end game here in terms of the core investment servicing business as being one which is much more akin to an outsourcing services business much less susceptible to kind of these instantaneous im going to put it to rfp and its just a stickier business and we are very respectful and wary of our competitors because having an edge and a lead can be easily caught up on but right now we believe we have that edge and lead and were going to capitalize on it in the investment management business again similar kinds of changes there were seeing an increased desire for the kinds of things that we do systematic and otherwise asset allocation which we are very very good at is now an area that everybody is talking about after literally decades of reliance on the model and guess what it didnt work or it doesnt work at all time it will lead to a lot of thinking and demand for that so we like our businesses we like where we are strategically in terms of whats going to happen will there be other brown brothers out there what i do think that you will see over time is an increasing number of competitors where this may not be their core business saying enough is enough the capital requirements in terms of the investment capital requirements are much too high mostly about the technology if it really does continue into an outsourcing kind of environment like we believe it will its going to put more demands to invest in the business and if this is business of your business structure you might decide you dont want to be in this business so thats how we see it going forward mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc that was expansive thank you the fixed cost part of the question you dont report it that way but just in rough terms i guess so in the asset servicing less rfps lowest price this enterprise outsourcing okay investment management more holistic instead of the ph raw old model but still as you transition you have a certain degree of fixed costs that are tough to manage i mean its not quite like a brokerage firm where you reduce bonuses so like is there any way just to ballpark how much of your expenses are fixed costs and i think theyve come down from the past and youre probably trying to indiscernible eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp mike its eric all good questions i think that this is actually an industry which used to be variable cost intensive right it was very manual and when you add a new piece of business you actually had to hire fund accountants who are working on ledger paper first and then on the excel sheets next and so its quite manually intensive and variable in nature its actually as weve automated think about the data centers youve talked about the movement to the cloud the developers that we have this business has really evolved to a fixed and semifixed cost oriented business in truth and that means that for certain types of business we bring on custody business core custody right so state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 kind of the most automated and the most the oldest part of what sits in our franchise that comes in you plug it in and the computers just process a few more times not overnight but literally in nanoseconds right and so this has become a more fixed cost business and so what we need to do is think about how do we want to manage those fixed costs how are they deployed the development dollars and technology how do we shape that each year because if we do that right well add feature functionality and that will bring in new business over time that will help retention and that will help growth and so this is more of a fixed cost business and semifixed cost where is it its more fixed and semifixed than and i think it actually has evolved and so whats important for us to do is to make sure that we have the products and the offerings and the client coverage to support that and to add new business add the right type of new business and then where there are variable cost components weve talked about some of the more manual and complex areas right servicing for private for example is still quite manual its complicated there are not standard systems typically in the industry theres very little in thirdparty software that one could avail oneself of those are the variable areas where we need to continue to find ways to automate and streamline and thats part of what were doing with the ongoing investment program that we have underway mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of rob wildhack from autonomous research please go ahead robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research hi guys auca wins in the fourth quarter were pretty good and eric you called out a strong pipeline there what level of new business wins are you expecting in and do you see those coming from any specific client category cohort service area anything like that eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp as we have said the pipeline remains strong i think were pleased with wins this year wins were about trillion for the full year what i have said is and i think we feel good about this target or line in the sand is weve said to drive the kind of organic growth that wed like we want to win about trillion per year of new business we did that this past year we did it in spades closer to double that in and thats our expectation we expect and we think thats par for as well obviously we want to sell more than that right we want to bring in more new clients or further deepen relationships with existing clients i think what we feel good about here is both the new business this year the trillion that has come in has come in at good fee rates the fee rates of the new wins are actually in line with our overall fee rate this year and so that means that as it onboards it will be neutral or even accretive to the fee rate so thats important and thats an important part of the program in terms of segments its been broadbased i mean this past quarter for example was broadbased across regions literally i think it was a third a third a third and we saw particularly strong growth this past year in asia state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 wed like to repeat that again i think we have an intensity on europe and north america as well so theres not id say its not one particular segment or one particular region its fairly broad but its a good pipeline overall robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research got it and then you also mentioned some higher renewals in the alpha business wondering if you could talk about the retention rate there how is the retention among front to back clients compared to your more traditional back or middle office only clients ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah rob i mean in terms of fully installed alpha clients the retention rate is and you wouldnt expect it to be much less than that simply because its still relatively new i think that theres a real commitment thats made on both sides of the house when you enter into these things first of all to actually rewire the firm around for the client to rewire around front to back theres a lot of effort on their part and while theres a lot of commonality across these clients theres a lot on our part that we need to do to install it so the contracts are longer but the reality is that the switching costs have also gone up dramatically in these fronttoback things so we would expect more but we also recognize that weve got to earn that i mean right now theres a when that happens theres a huge dependency on the part of the client and us delivering every day and so we take that responsibility quite seriously robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research got it thanks ron operator thank you your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja from jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you just a couple of little details for you eric you mentioned rwa came down by about billion and you expect to see another decline billion to billion any color on what you did there and is it sustainable post eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah let me just clarify rwa was lower than expected in the fourth quarter by about billion and in the first quarter we expect it to reverse in other words to move back up by billion billion billion and its just driven by some of the underlying volatility in our business for example overdrafts were lighter than expected this quarter they moved around by a few billion dollars and that moves rwa by a few billion dollars each quarter in the fx book we run a very sort of a typical forward book two week four week six week forward and as you have us dollar appreciation or depreciation you can get billion moves in rwa relatively easily so thats just the volatility that we saw we tend to be quite careful to stay within our rwa internal limits thats why we tend state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 not to have upswings in rwa but we tend to have these beneficial quarters now and then and well just note them to you so you can model out our capital ratio trends vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great second another little detail for you your software processing and data could you parse that into data versus crd since thats not combined since youve got this big growth rate there whats going on underneath how much is data how much is eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure its a vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc indiscernible eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp combination i mean the bulk of that is really around charles river and the franchise that we purchased back in which has really given us the kind of growth that we had expected so you can go back and compare the size of the franchise i think at the last disclosure i think we probably showed it a year ago and compare it to that software and data line and get a kind of first an adjustment but its the large majority ill say of that line data to us is though a very appealing offering that supplements whats in sometimes sold with the charles river offering sometimes with alpha and the middle office sometimes sold as supplemental to just custody and accounting because its such a high value and informative kind of window sometimes for risk management purposes sometimes for client transparency purposes for our asset manager or asset owner clients and so its actually one of the faster growing areas of that area and thats why weve put it together because its actually a software type sale but an important one ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah vivek its ron let me just add to that because weve done a lot of innovation in this area of new product development and we do expect that to continue to grow as eric said because everybody is interested in simplifying their operations simplifying and getting control of their tech depth and innovating on the technology side but in addition theres a data management data control in some parts of the world with some investors its also location of data where does the data actually both move and rest so this is an increasingly this is a growth area it goes beyond asset managers large asset owners and indiscernible so we see it as a way to extend what were doing broadly in the alpha arena vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and just to clarify on crd eric to your comment earlier when you had previously talked about it was growing in the sort of the lowdouble digit range this was a year or two ago when it was broken out is that still the pace at state street corp stt corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2023 which its just continuing to grow or is that as it matures slowing down a little bit or is it accelerating any granularity any color on that eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah no it continues to outpace id say it moves around depending on some of the onpremise renewals that still flow through the pl highsingle digits lowdouble digits and what weve done is continue to the team continues to drive kind of the core crd offerings you know these you know it start with an equity product its moved to equity and fixed income which are now industry i think industry at peer levels in some cases industryleading and then what weve done is supplemented that for example we purchased a small company called mercatus which was kind of a frontend portion of a charles river type offering and so weve added a kind of private market area to what ill call the broader
