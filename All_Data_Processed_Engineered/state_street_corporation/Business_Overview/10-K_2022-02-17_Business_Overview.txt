promotion and turnover rates and implement programs to help retain our best employees for example we saw an opportunity to correct an imbalance in the competitiveness of our compensation program by accelerating expenses associated with certain deferred cash incentive awards in the fourth quarter of this change will allow us to realign the mix of immediate versus deferred cash in our incentive compensation awards in future periods which will make our pay practices more competitive and enable us to better attract talent in an increasingly tight talent market our mix of deferred equity remains unchanged we also continue to see success redeploying employees via the internal talent marketplace that we launched during the talent marketplace is an innovative way for our employees to

holding company act generally limits the activities in which bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries may engage to managing or controlling banks and to a range of activities that are considered to be closely related to banking bank holding companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding companies such as the parent company may engage in a broader range of activities considered to be financial in nature the regulatory limits on our activities also apply to nonbanking entities that we are deemed to control for purposes of the bank holding company act which may include companies of which we own or control or more of a class of voting shares the federal reserve may order a bank holding company to terminate any activity or its ownership or control of a nonbanking subsidiary if the federal reserve finds that the activity ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety soundness or stability of a banking subsidiary or is inconsistent with sound banking principles or statutory purposes the bank holding company act also requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval of the federal reserve before it acquires substantially all the assets of any bank or ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank the parent company has elected to be treated as a financial holding company and as such may engage in a broader range of nonbanking activities than permitted for bank holding companies and their subsidiaries that have not elected to become financial holding companies financial holding companies may engage directly or indirectly either de novo or by acquisition in activities that are defined by the federal reserve to be financial in nature provided that the financial holding company gives the federal reserve afterthefact notice of the new activities activities defined to be financial in nature include but are not limited to providing financial or investment advice underwriting dealing in or making markets in securities making merchant banking investments subject to significant limitations and any activities previously found by the federal reserve to be closely related to banking in order to maintain our status as a financial holding company we and each of our us depository institution subsidiaries are expected to be well capitalized and well managed as defined in applicable regulations and determined in part by the results of regulatory examinations and must comply with community reinvestment act obligations failure to maintain these standards may result in restrictions on our activities and may ultimately permit the federal reserve to take enforcement actions against us and restrict our ability to engage in activities defined to be financial in nature currently under the bank holding company act we may not be able to engage in new activities or acquire shares or control of other businesses in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject has increased regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place subsequently in may the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act egrrcpa was enacted the egrrcpas revisions to the us financial regulatory framework have altered certain laws and regulations applicable to us and other major financial services firms under the current administration changes in key personnel at the agencies that regulate such banking organizations including the federal banking agencies may result in increased prudential and conduct oversight more extensive regulatory requirements changing interpretations of existing rules and guidelines and potentially more stringent enforcement and more severe penalties irrespective of any regulatory change we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision in addition increased regulatory requirements and initiatives have been and are being implemented internationally with respect to financial institutions state street corporation including

the basel iii rule related to minimum capital requirements regulatory capital buffers and deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital were fully implemented as of january we are also subject to the market risk capital rule jointly issued by us banking regulators to implement the changes to the market risk capital framework in the us as required by the doddfrank act we as an advanced approaches banking organization are subject to a capital floor also referred to as the collins amendment in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy including the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer described below in this supervision and regulation section our riskbased capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches risk weighted assets the basel iii rule provides two frameworks for the calculation of rwa for purposes of bank regulatory compliance the standardized approach and the advanced approaches which are applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations like us the standardized approach prescribes standardized risk weights for certain on and offbalance sheet exposures in the calculation of rwa the advanced approaches consist of the advanced internal ratingsbased approach airb used for the calculation of rwa related to credit risk and the advanced measurement approach ama used for the calculation of rwa related to operational risk in november the federal reserve and the other us federal banking agencies us agencies issued a final rule that among other things implements the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk saccr a methodology for calculating the exposure amount for derivative contracts under the final rule beginning on january we have the option to use the saccr or the internal model methodology imm to measure the exposure amount of our cleared and uncleared derivative transactions under our advanced approaches calculation we have elected to use the saccr for purposes of our advanced approaches capital calculations beginning on january we are required to determine the amount of these exposures using the saccr under our standardized approach capital calculation minimum riskbased capital requirements among other things the basel iii rule as amended requires a minimum cet1 riskbased capital ratio of and a minimum slr of for advanced approaches banking organizations a minimum tier riskbased capital ratio of a minimum total capital ratio of and the stress capital and countercyclical capital buffers referenced below as well as a gsib surcharge and the enhanced slr which acts as an slr buffer described in capital in financial condition in our managements discussion and analysis in this form 10k under the basel iii rule our total regulatory capital is composed of three tiers cet1 capital tier capital which includes cet1 capital and tier capital the total of tier and tier capital adjusted as applicable is referred to as total regulatory capital cet1 capital is composed of core capital elements such as qualifying common shareholders equity and related surplus plus retained earnings and the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation plus net unrealized gains losses on debt and equity securities classified as afs less treasury stock and less goodwill and other intangible assets net of related deferred tax liabilities tier capital is composed of cet1 capital plus additional tier capital instruments which for us includes four series of preferred equity outstanding as of december tier capital includes certain eligible subordinated longterm debt instruments total regulatory capital consists of tier capital and tier capital state street corporation certain other items if applicable must be deducted from tier and tier capital including certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated banking financial and insurance entities and the amount of expected credit losses that exceeds recorded allowances for loan and other credit losses expected credit losses are calculated for wholesale credit exposures by formula in conformity with the basel iii rule gsib surcharge the eight us bank holding companies deemed to be gsibs including us are required to calculate the gsib surcharge annually according to two methods and be bound by the higher of the two method assesses systemic importance based upon five equallyweighted components size interconnectedness complexity crossjurisdictional activity and substitutability or method alters the calculation from method by factoring in a shortterm wholesale funding score in place of substitutability and applying a fixed coefficient to each of the five components method is the binding methodology for us as of december and our applicable surcharge for was calculated to be based on a calculation date as of december based on a calculation date as of december our gsib surcharge could have been which under the generally applicable provisions of the capital rules absent regulatory relief would go into effect on january however in may the federal reserve granted our request for relief relating to the effects of the money market mutual fund liquidity facility mmlf program on the calculation of our gsib surcharge as a result of this relief our gsib surcharge for will remain as noted above our gsib surcharge must be calculated annually and yearoveryear changes in our method or method gsib scores may therefore result in changes to our gsib surcharge if our method or method score changes yearoveryear such that we would become subject to a higher surcharge the higher surcharge would not become effective for two years from the as of date eg a higher surcharge calculated as of december would not become effective until january if however our method or method score changes yearoveryear such that we would become subject to a lower surcharge we would be subject to the lower surcharge beginning one full year from the as of date eg a lower surcharge calculated as of december would become effective january stress capital buffer on march the us agencies issued the scb final rule that replaces under the standardized approach the fixed capital conservation buffer with an scb calculated as the difference between the institutions starting and lowest projected cet1 ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the federal reserves supervisory stress test plus planned common stock dividend payments as a percentage of rwa from the fourth through seventh quarter of the supervisory stress testing planning horizon based on our results from the supervisory stress test our scb for the period of october through september is set at the minimum of of rwa for additional information about the scb final rule refer to capital planning stress tests and dividends in this supervision and regulation section under the scb final rule a banking organization would be able to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments without specified quantitative limitations although subject to other potential regulatory constraints such as supervisory limitations as long as it maintains its required scb plus the applicable gsib surcharge plus any potentially applicable countercyclical capital buffer over the minimum required riskbased capital ratios and as long as it satisfies all leverage based capital requirements and buffers from time to time under certain economic conditions banking regulators may establish a minimum countercyclical capital buffer up to a maximum of of total rwa the countercyclical capital buffer was initially set by banking regulators at zero and has not been increased since its inception assuming a countercyclical buffer of the minimum capital ratios as of january including a capital conservation buffer and an scb of for advanced and standardized approaches respectively and a gsib surcharge of are for cet1 capital for tier riskbased capital and for total riskbased capital in order for us to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments without limitation state street corporation leverage ratios we are subject to a minimum tier leverage ratio and a supplementary leverage ratio the tier leverage ratio is based on tier capital and adjusted quarterly average onbalance sheet assets the tier leverage ratio differs from the slr primarily in that the denominator of the tier leverage ratio is a quarterly average of onbalance sheet assets while the slr includes both onbalance sheet and certain offbalance sheet exposures we must maintain a minimum tier leverage ratio of we are also subject to a minimum slr of and as a us gsib we must maintain an additional slr buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives if we do not maintain this buffer limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall in november pursuant to the egrrcpa the us agencies adopted a final rule that excludes central bank deposits from a custodial banking organizations total leverage exposure for purpose of calculating the slr and which is not applicable to total leverage exposure under the calculation of tier leverage this exclusion is equal to the lesser of i the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and ii the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts the rule became effective on april for the quarter ended december we excluded billion of average balances held on deposit at central banks from the denominator used in the calculation of our slr based on this custodial banking exclusion the tlac and ltd that state street is required to hold under slrbased requirements reflect the exclusion of certain central bank balances as a consequence of the rule the saccr final rule adopted in november which went into effect for us on january also requires us to incorporate the saccr into the calculation of our total leverage exposure for the purpose of calculating slr in the federal reserve proposed modifications to the slr that would replace the current slr buffer applicable to us with an slr buffer equal to of our applicable gsib capital surcharge the federal reserve has not finalized these proposed modifications selected recent regulatory developments summary table start final rule issued final rule effective date description august january in march the us agencies issued an interim final rule followed by a final rule in august that revised the definition of eligible retained income for all us banking organizations including us the revised definition of eligible retained income makes any automatic limitations on capital distributions that could apply to us under the federal banking agencies capital or tlac rules take effect on a more gradual basis in the event that our capital leverage or tlac ratios were to decline below regulatory requirements including regulatory capital leverage or tlac buffers as applicable october april the us agencies issued a final rule that requires us and state street bank to make deductions from regulatory capital for investments in certain unsecured debt instruments issued by bank holding companies and us intermediate holding companies of foreign banks that are subject to the federal reserves tlac and ltd requirements as well as foreign gsibs october july in october the us agencies issued a final rule implementing the basel committee on banking supervisions bcbs nsfr in the united states which applies to us and state street bank the final rule requires large banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding which is a weighted measure of a companys funding sources over a oneyear time horizon calculated by applying standardized weightings to the companys equity and liabilities based on their expected stability that is no less than the amount of required stable funding which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics november january the us agencies issued a final rule that among other things implements the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk saccr a methodology for calculating the exposure amount for derivative contracts under the us regulatory capital rules under the final rule we have the option to use the saccr or the internal model methodology imm to measure the exposure amount of our cleared and uncleared derivative transactions under our advanced approaches calculation we have elected to use the saccr for purposes of our advanced approaches capital calculations we are required to determine the amount of these exposures using the saccr under our standardized approach capital calculation due to the nature of our trading activities the final rule is likely to have a greater proportional impact on our rwa than on some of our gsib peers in addition under the final rule we are required to use a simplified formula to determine the rwa amount of our central counterparty default fund contributions the final rule also requires us to incorporate the saccr into the calculation of our total leverage exposure for the purpose of calculating slr table end state street corporation as a gsib we are subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards our status as a gsib has also resulted in heightened prudential and conduct expectations of our us and international regulators with respect to our capital and liquidity management and our compliance and risk oversight programs these heightened expectations have increased our regulatory compliance costs including personnel technology and systems as well as significant additional implementation and related costs to enhance our regulatory compliance programs regulatory compliance requirements are anticipated to remain at least at the elevated levels we have experienced over the past several years failure to meet current and future regulatory capital requirements could subject us to a variety of enforcement actions including the termination of state street banks deposit insurance by the fdic and to certain restrictions on our business including those that are described above in this supervision and regulation section not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company and therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same additional capital requirements for additional information about our regulatory capital position and our

combined eligible tier regulatory capital and ltd separate external ltd requirements and clean holding company requirements that impose restrictions on certain types of liabilities and limit nontlac related third party liabilities to of external tlac among other things the tlac rule requires us to comply with minimum requirements for external tlac and external ltd specifically as of january we

holding companies and us intermediate holding companies of foreign banks that are subject to the federal reserves tlac and ltd requirements as well as foreign gsibs liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio in addition to capital standards the basel iii framework introduced two quantitative liquidity standards the lcr and the nsfr we are subject to the rule issued by the us agencies implementing the bcbss lcr in the us the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of internationally active banking organizations like us to improve the banking industrys ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk the lcr measures an institutions hqla against its net cash outflows under a prescribed stress environment we report lcr to the federal reserve daily and are required to calculate and maintain an lcr that is equal to or greater than in addition we publicly disclose certain qualitative and quantitative information about our lcr consistent with the requirements of the federal reserves final rule compliance with the lcr has required that we maintain an investment portfolio that contains an adequate amount of hqla in general hqla investments generate a lower investment return than other types of investments resulting in a negative impact on our nii and our nim in addition the level of hqla we are required to maintain under the lcr is dependent upon our client relationships and the nature of services we provide which may change over time deposits resulting from certain services provided operational deposits are treated as more resilient during periods of stress than other deposits as a result if balances of operational deposits increased relative to our total client deposit base we would expect to require less hqla in order to maintain our lcr conversely if balances of state street corporation operational deposits decreased relative to our total client deposit base we would expect to require more hqla on may the us banking agencies issued a rule that modifies the lcr rule to neutralize the impact on lcr of the advances made by the mmlf and paycheck protection liquidity facility program and the exposures securing such advances in october the us agencies issued a final rule implementing the bcbss nsfr in the united states the final rule requires large banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding which is a weighted measure of a companys funding sources over a oneyear time horizon calculated by applying standardized weightings to the companys equity and liabilities based on their expected stability that is no less than the amount of required stable funding which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics as a us gsib we are required to maintain an nsfr that is equal to or greater than the final rule became effective as of july the final rule requires us to publicly disclose our quarterly nsfr on a semiannual basis beginning in capital planning stress tests and dividends pursuant to the doddfrank act the federal reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies including us which form part of the federal reserves annual stress testing and capital planning framework the federal reserve conducts its own stress tests of our business operations using supervisory models referred to as supervisory stress tests the results of which it uses to calibrate our annual scb subject to a minimum of in addition under the federal reserves capital plan rule we must conduct periodic stress testing of our business operations and submit an annual capital plan to the federal reserve taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by us and by the federal reserve the federal reserve conducts a qualitative assessment of our capital plan as part of the annual supervisory process known as ccar to evaluate the strength of our capital planning practices including our ability to identify measure and determine the appropriate amount of capital for our risks and controls and governance supporting capital planning the federal reserves final rule to integrate its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements applies to certain bank holding companies including us the final rule introduced an scb and related changes to the capital planning and stress testing processes the standardized approach scb equals the greater of i and ii the maximum decline in our cet1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period plus the ratio of a the sum of the dollar amount of our planned common stock dividends for the fourth through seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projection period to b our projected rwa for the quarter in which our projected cet1 capital ratio reaches its minimum in the supervisory stress test riskedbased regulatory capital requirements under the standardized approach include the scb as summarized above as well as our gsib capital surcharge and any applicable countercyclical capital buffer the final rule made related changes to capital planning and stress testing processes for bank holding companies subject to the scb requirement in particular the final rule assumes that bank holding companies maintain a constant level of assets and rwa throughout the supervisory stress test projection period in addition under the final rule the supervisory stress test no longer assumes that bank holding companies make all nine quarters of planned capital distributions under stress although the scb incorporates the dollar amount of four quarters of planned common stock dividends as described above the final rule did not change regulatory capital requirements under the advanced approaches the tier leverage ratio or the slr our scb requirement was for the period from october through september on june we were notified by the federal reserve of the results from the supervisory stress test including our preliminary scb of our scb calculated under the supervisory stress test was well below the minimum resulting in an scb at that floor which went into effect starting october and which will be effective through september although the final scb rule changed the effects of the ccar and supervisory stress test processes so that the scb rather than ccar is the source of our stressbased capital requirements we continue to be subject to ccars capital plan requirements and the supervisory assessment of our capital planning activities under the capital planning requirements our annual capital plan must include a description of all of our planned capital actions over a ninequarter planning horizon including any capital qualifying instruments any capital distributions such as payments of dividends on or repurchases of our stock and any similar action that the federal reserve determines could affect our consolidated capital the capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios including the minimum ratios under the basel iii rule and serve as a source of strength to state street bank under supervisory stress scenarios changes in our strategy merger or acquisition activity state street corporation or unanticipated uses of capital could result in a change in our capital

requirements the federal reserve has the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends the repurchase of common stock or other capital actions that reduce capital by the banking organizations it supervises including the parent company and state street bank if in the federal reserves opinion the capital action would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the

conduct semiannual state streetrun stress tests and to publicly disclose the summary results of our state streetrun stress tests under the severely adverse economic scenario we are also required to undergo an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve the egrrcpa modifies certain aspects of these stresstesting requirements reducing the number of scenarios in the federal reserves supervisory stress test from three to two and modifying our obligation to perform companyrun stresstests from semiannually to annually the federal reserve adopted a final rule in october that among other things implemented this modification the volcker rule we are subject to the volcker rule and implementing regulations the volcker rule prohibits banking entities including us and our affiliates from engaging in certain prohibited proprietary trading activities as defined in the volcker rule regulations subject to exemptions for marketmaking related activities riskmitigating hedging underwriting and certain other activities the volcker rule also requires banking entities to either restructure or divest certain ownership interests in and relationships with covered funds as such terms are defined in the volcker rule regulations the volcker rule regulations require banking entities to establish extensive programs designed to promote compliance with the restrictions of the volcker rule we have established a compliance program that we believe complies with the volcker rule regulations as currently in effect our compliance program restricts our ability in the future to service certain types of funds in particular covered funds for which state street global advisors acts as an advisor and certain types of trustee relationships consequently volcker rule compliance entails both state street corporation the cost of a compliance program and loss of certain revenue and future opportunities enhanced prudential standards the doddfrank act as amended by the egrrcpa establishes a systemic risk regime to which large bank holding companies with billion or more in consolidated assets such as us are subject the federal reserve is required to tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies based on their size complexity risk profile and other factors us gsibs such as us are expected to remain subject to the most stringent requirements including heightened capital leverage liquidity and risk management requirements and singlecounterparty credit limits sccl the fsoc can recommend prudential standards reporting and disclosure requirements for sifis to the federal reserve and must approve any finding by the federal reserve that a financial institution poses a grave threat to financial stability and must undertake mitigating actions the fsoc is also empowered to designate systemically important payment clearing and settlement activities of financial institutions subjecting them to prudential supervision and regulation and assisted by the office of financial research within the us department of the treasury can gather data and reports from financial institutions including us under the federal reserves enhanced prudential standards regulation under the doddfrank act as amended by the egrrcpa we are required to comply with various liquidityrelated risk management standards and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing this liquidity buffer is in addition to other liquidity requirements such as the lcr and the nsfr the regulations also establish requirements and responsibilities for our risk committee and mandate risk management standards in the federal reserve finalized rules that established sccl for large banking organizations us gsibs including us are subject to a limit of of tier capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any major counterparty defined to include other us gsibs foreign gsibs and nonbank sifis supervised by the federal reserve in addition we are subject to a limit of of tier capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any other unaffiliated counterparty the final sccl rules became effective for us on january the federal reserve has established a rule that imposes contractual requirements on certain qualified financial contracts to which us gsibs including us and their subsidiaries are parties under the rule certain qualified financial contracts generally must expressly provide that transfer restrictions and default rights against a us gsib or subsidiary of a us gsib are limited to the same extent as they would be under the federal deposit insurance act and title ii of the doddfrank act and their implementing regulations in addition certain qualified financial contracts may not among other things permit the exercise of any crossdefault right against a us gsib or subsidiary of a us gsib based on an affiliates entry into insolvency resolution or similar proceedings subject to certain creditor protections the systemicrisk regime also provides that for us gsibs deemed to pose a grave threat to us financial stability the federal reserve upon an fsoc vote must limit that institutions ability to merge restrict its ability to offer financial products require it to terminate activities impose conditions on activities or as a last resort require it to dispose of assets upon a grave threat determination by the fsoc the federal reserve must issue rules that require financial institutions subject to the systemicrisk regime to maintain a debttoequity ratio of no more than to if the fsoc considers it necessary to mitigate the risk of the grave threat the federal reserve also has the ability to establish further standards including those regarding contingent capital enhanced public disclosures and limits on shortterm debt including offbalance sheet exposures recovery and resolution planning under section 165d of the doddfrank act we are required to submit a resolution plan on a biennial basis jointly to the federal reserve and the fdic the agencies the purpose of our resolution plan is to describe our preferred resolution strategy and to demonstrate that we have the resources and capabilities to execute on that strategy in the event of major financial distress through resolution planning we seek to maintain our role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system while minimizing risk to the financial system the final rule requires a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan on an alternating basis in the relevant submission years we submitted our updated targeted 165d resolution plan by july the targeted resolution plan included the core elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level information about the impact of the covid19 pandemic on resolution planning in addition actions taken to remediate the shortcoming related to the implementation of governance mechanisms were included in the plan our next full resolution plan is due july in the event of material financial distress our preferred resolution strategy is the single point of entry spoe strategy the spoe strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the parent company and pursuant to a support agreement among the state street corporation parent company ssif a direct subsidiary of the parent company our beneficiary entities as defined below and certain of our other entities ssif is obligated up to its available resources to recapitalize andor provide liquidity to state street bank and the other entities benefiting from such capital andor liquidity support collectively with state street bank beneficiary entities in amounts designed to prevent the beneficiary entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings following the recapitalization of or provision of liquidity to the beneficiary entities the parent company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the us bankruptcy code the beneficiary entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the parent companys claimants under the support agreement the parent company prefunded ssif by contributing certain of its assets primarily its liquid assets cash deposits investments in intercompany debt investments in marketable securities and other cash and noncash equivalent investments to ssif at the time it entered into the support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets to the extent available on an ongoing basis in consideration for these contributions ssif has agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the parent company and all of the beneficiary entities in accordance with the parent companys capital and liquidity policies under the support agreement the parent company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif has provided the parent company with a committed credit line and issued and may issue one or more promissory notes to the parent company the parent company funding notes that together are intended to allow the parent company to continue to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a recapitalization event which is defined as the earlier occurrence of one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or the authorization by the parent companys board of directors for the parent company to commence bankruptcy proceedings the support agreement does not obligate ssif to maintain any specific level of resources and ssif may not have sufficient resources to implement the spoe strategy in the event a recapitalization event occurs the obligations outstanding under the parent company funding notes would automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to ssif the obligations of the parent company and ssif under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the parent company and ssif would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the beneficiary entities ssif is a distinct legal entity separate from the parent company and the parent companys other affiliates in accordance with our policies we are required to monitor on an ongoing basis the capital and liquidity needs of state street bank and our other beneficiary entities to support this process we have established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur the trigger thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support that results in us emerging from resolution as a stabilized institution with market confidence restored upon the occurrence of a recapitalization event ssif would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the parent company the parent company would be required to contribute to ssif any remaining assets it is required to contribute to ssif under the support agreement which specifically exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding ssif would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the beneficiary entities to support such entities continued operation to the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement and the parent company would be expected to commence chapter proceedings under the us bankruptcy code no person or entity other than a party to the support agreement should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a beneficiary entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditors perspective or determining whether to enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities state street bank is also required to submit periodically to the fdic a plan for resolution in the event of its failure referred to as an idi plan we submitted our last idi plan before july in november the fdic had announced that until the fdic completed revisions to its idi plan requirements no idi plans would be required to be filed on june the fdic issued a policy statement on resolution plans for idis that allows for content streamlining and adjusts the frequency of submissions to a threeyear cycle state street banks next idi plan submission deadline will be december additionally we are required to submit a recovery plan to the federal reserve this plan includes detailed governance triggers and contingency actions that can be implemented in a state street corporation timely manner in the event

act certain financial companies including bank holding companies such as the parent company and certain covered subsidiaries can be subjected to the orderly liquidation authority which went into effect in for the fdic to be appointed as our receiver twothirds of the fdic board and twothirds of the federal reserve board must recommend appointment and the us treasury secretary in consultation with the us president must then make certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations absent such actions we as a bank holding company would remain subject to the us bankruptcy code the orderly liquidation authority went into effect in and rulemaking is proceeding incrementally with some regulations now finalized and others planned but not yet proposed if the fdic were appointed as the receiver of the parent company pursuant to the orderly liquidation authority the fdic would have considerable powers to resolve the parent company including the power to remove officers and directors responsible for the parent companys failure and to appoint new directors and officers the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review the ability to differentiate among similarly situated creditors subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation and broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution in the fdic released its proposed spoe strategy for resolution of a sifi under the orderly liquidation authority the fdics release outlines how it would use its powers under the orderly liquidation authority to resolve a sifi by placing its toptier us holding company in receivership and keeping its operating subsidiaries open and out of insolvency proceedings by transferring the operating subsidiaries to a new bridge holding company recapitalizing the operating subsidiaries and imposing losses on the shareholders and creditors of the holding company in
