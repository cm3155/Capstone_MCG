had lowpaying jobs as a restaurant hostess and as a preschool teachers assistant before she took a fourmonth program at npower in basic technology skills it was enough to land a techsupport internship at bank of america in the internship was followed by a contract job and then a fulltime position she is now a technical support analyst on the commodities trading desk and makes more than a year im still pretty junior but this has been a big leap for me said ms ferreira who lives in queens bank of america has close ties with training programs that focus on developing the potential of people like ashantee franklin ms franklin lost her job at a dog day care and walking service after covid19 hit last year she decided to make the setback an opportunity applied to the npower program and completed the fourmonth course the dog care service had reopened and ms franklin was back walking dogs when an npower jobplacement coordinator called about an opening in an entrylevel program at bank of america she applied did well in interviews and was accepted i decided my time as a dog handler would come to an end she said ms franklin who lives in brooklyn started her contract job at bank of america in june as a technology business analyst her starting salary is about double what she made in past years which was less than fostering upward mobility in corporate america is the goal of oneten a
