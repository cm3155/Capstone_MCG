item risk factors in the course of conducting our business operations we are exposed to a variety of risks some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses the discussion below addresses the most significant factors of which we are currently aware that could affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition additional factors that could affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition are discussed in forwardlooking statements in the mda on page however other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this annual report on s could by itself or together with other factors materially adversely affect our liquidity competitive position business reputation results of operations capital position or financial condition including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues which could result in material losses market our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the us and international financial markets us and nonus fiscal monetary and regulatory policies and economic conditions generally general economic political and social conditions in the us and in one or more countries abroad affect markets in the us and abroad and our business in particular markets in the us or abroad may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates availability and market conditions of financing unexpected changes in gross domestic product gdp economic growth or its sustainability inflation consumer spending employment levels wage stagnation federal government shutdowns energy prices home prices bankruptcies a default by a significant market participant fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies liquidity of the global financial markets the growth of global trade and commerce trade policies the availability and cost of capital and credit disruption of communication transportation or energy infrastructure and investor sentiment and confidence additionally global markets may be adversely affected by natural disasters the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics cyber attacks or campaigns military conflict terrorism or other geopolitical events market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our business liquidity also any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the us or abroad as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in revenue and adversely table start bank of america table end affect our results of operations and financial condition including capital and liquidity levels in the us and abroad uncertainties surrounding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges actions taken by the federal reserve including changes in its target funds rate and balance sheet management and other central banks are beyond our control and difficult to predict and can affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities and impact our borrowers a continued protracted period of lower interest rates or a move to negative interest rates in the us could result in lower revenue and maintain or increase pressure on netinterest income which may adversely affect our results of operations uncertainty or ongoing developments in connection with the future relationship between the uk and the eu and the resulting impact on the financial markets and regulations in relevant jurisdictions could negatively impact our revenues and ongoing operations in europe and beyond changes to existing us laws and regulatory policies including those related to financial regulation taxation international trade fiscal policy and healthcare may adversely impact us or global economic activity and our customers counterparties and the corporations earnings and operations for example significant fiscal policy initiatives may increase uncertainty surrounding the formulation and direction of us monetary policy and volatility of interest rates higher us interest rates relative to other major economies could increase the likelihood of a more volatile and appreciating us dollar changes or proposed changes to certain us trade policies particularly with important trading partners including china and the eu have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact financial markets disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation including through the use of tariffs foreign exchange measures or the largescale sale of us treasury bonds further the use of tariffs among countries not directly involving the us could spread and could damage our customers directly and indirectly any of these developments could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses our customers our securities and derivatives portfolios our level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses the carrying value of our deferred tax assets our capital levels liquidity and our results of operations additionally events and ongoing uncertainty related to the uks exit from the eu and the uncertainty related to the transition from interbank offered rates ibors and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates arrs could negatively impact markets in the us and abroad and our business andor magnify any negative impact of the above referenced developments on our business customers and results of operations increased market volatility and adverse changes in other financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk our liquidity competitive position business results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates fluctuations in equity and futures prices lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and business factors these market risks may adversely affect among other things i the value of our on and offbalance sheet securities trading assets and other financial instruments ii the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets iii the value of assets under management aum iv fee income relating to aum v customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives vi the volume of client activity in our trading operations vii investment banking fees viii the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and ix our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing for example the value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates if the federal reserve or a nonus central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy market interest rates could be affected which could adversely impact the value of such assets in addition the low interest rate environment and a flat or inverted yield curve could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations including future revenue and earnings growth we use various models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures but those are subject to inherent limitations for more information regarding models and strategies see item risk factors other on page in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa these types of market movements may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses these changes in correlation can be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours in these and other cases it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets to the extent that we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions in addition challenging market conditions may also adversely affect our investment banking fees for more information about market risk and our market risk management policies and procedures see market risk management in the mda on page we may incur losses if the value of certain assets declines including due to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds we have a large portfolio of financial instruments including certain loans and loan commitments loans heldforsale securities financing agreements assetbacked secured financings longterm deposits longterm debt trading account assets and liabilities derivative assets and liabilities availableforsale afs debt and marketable equity securities other debt securities equity method investments and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value and other accounting values subject to impairment assessments we determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance which for financial instruments measured at fair value requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements the fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity credit quality funding impact on certain derivatives and other transactionspecific factors where appropriate gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations including higher or lower mortgage banking income and earnings unless we have effectively hedged our exposures increases in interest rates may result in a decrease in residential mortgage loan originations in addition increases in interest rates may adversely impact the fair value of debt securities and accordingly for debt securities classified as afs may adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and thus capital levels fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions or indices the financial strength of counterparties with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets also will affect the fair value of these assets table start bank of america table end sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets which may make it difficult to sell hedge or value these assets the inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our riskweighted assets which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs asset values also directly impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses we receive assetbased management fees based on the value of our clients portfolios or investments in funds managed by us and in some cases we also receive performance fees based on increases in the value of such investments declines in asset values can reduce the value of our clients portfolios or fund assets which in turn can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets for more information on fair value measurements see note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our asset management businesses see gwim in the mda on page for more information on interest rate risk management see interest rate risk management for the banking book in the mda on page liquidity if we are unable to access the capital markets or continue to maintain deposits or our borrowing costs increase our liquidity and competitive position will be negatively affected liquidity is essential to our businesses we fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets we rely on certain secured funding sources such as repo markets which are typically shortterm and creditsensitive in nature we also engage in asset securitization transactions including with the governmentsponsored enterprises gses to fund consumer lending activities our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements including as a result of credit concerns for shortterm borrowing changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile prolonged federal government shutdowns or changes in regulations guidance or gse status that impact our funding avenues or ability to access certain funding sources additionally the unwillingness or inability of the federal reserve to act as lender of last resort unexpected simultaneous draws on lines of credit restricted access to the assets of prime brokerage clients the withdrawal of customer deposits which could result from customer attrition for higher yields or the desire for more conservative alternatives increased regulatory liquidity capital and margin requirements for our us or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries changes in patterns of intraday liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or technology failure or other idiosyncratic event failure by a significant market participant or third party such as a clearing agent or custodian reputational issues or negative perceptions about our short or longterm business prospects including downgrades of our credit ratings may adversely affect our liquidity several of these factors may arise due to circumstances beyond our control such as general market volatility disruption shock or stress federal reserve policy decisions including fluctuations in interest rates or federal reserve balance sheet composition negative views about the corporation or financial services industry generally or due to a specific news event changes in the regulatory environment or governmental fiscal or monetary policies actions by credit rating agencies or an operational problem that affects third parties or us the impact of these events whether within our control or not could include an inability to sell assets or redeem investments unforeseen outflows of cash the need to draw on liquidity facilities the reduction of financing balances and the loss of equity secured funding debt repurchases to support the secondary market or meet client requests and the need for additional funding for commitments and contingencies as well as unexpected collateral calls among other things the result of which could be a liquidity shortfall andor impact on our liquidity coverage ratio our cost of obtaining funding is directly related to prevailing market conditions including changes in interest and currency exchange rates and to our credit spreads credit spreads are the amount in excess of the interest rate of us treasury securities or other benchmark securities of a similar maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in marktomarket or credit valuation adjustment exposures changes in our credit spreads are marketdriven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile we may also experience spread compression as a result of offering higher than expected deposit rates in order to attract and maintain deposits due to increased marketplace rate competition additionally concentrations within our funding profile such as maturities currencies or counterparties can reduce our funding efficiency for more information about our liquidity position and other liquidity matters including credit ratings and outlooks and the policies and procedures we use to manage our liquidity risks see liquidity risk in the mda on page adverse changes to our credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies could significantly limit our access to funding or the capital markets increase our borrowing costs or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings in addition credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and seek to engage in certain transactions including otc derivatives credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and asset securitizations our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies which consider a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as the current economic and geopolitical environment and to a lesser extent the likelihood of the us government providing meaningful support to us or our subsidiaries in a crisis rating agencies could make adjustments to our credit ratings at any time and there can be no assurance as to when and whether downgrades will occur a reduction in certain of our credit ratings could result in a wider credit spread and negatively affect our liquidity access to credit markets the related cost of funds our businesses and certain trading revenues particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical if the shortterm credit ratings of our parent company or bank or brokerdealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels we may suffer the potential loss of access to shortterm funding sources such as repo financing andor incur increased cost of funds and increased collateral requirements under the terms of certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements if our or our subsidiaries credit ratings are downgraded the counterparties may require additional collateral or terminate these contracts or agreements table start bank of america table end while certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution are inherently uncertain as they depend upon numerous dynamic complex and interrelated factors and assumptions including whether any downgrade of a firms longterm credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its shortterm credit ratings and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers investors and counterparties for more information on the amount of additional collateral required and derivative liabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination at december if the rating agencies had downgraded their longterm senior debt ratings for the corporation or certain subsidiaries by each of two incremental notches see creditrelated contingent features and collateral in note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our credit ratings and their potential effects to our liquidity see liquidity risk credit ratings in the mda on page and note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements bank of america corporation is a holding company and we depend upon our subsidiaries for liquidity including the ability to pay dividends to shareholders and to fund payments on other obligations applicable laws and regulations including capital and liquidity requirements and actions taken pursuant to our resolution plan could restrict our ability to transfer funds from subsidiaries to bank of america corporation or to other subsidiaries which could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition bank of america corporation as the parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries we evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal regulatory contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another including the parent company which could result in adverse liquidity events the parent company depends on dividends distributions loans advances and other payments from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations including debt obligations any inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make payments to us may adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition many of our subsidiaries including our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses intercompany arrangements we entered into in connection with our resolution planning submissions could restrict the amount of funding available to the parent company from our subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions additional restrictions on related party transactions increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts as well as lower earnings can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of the parent company and even require the parent company to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries also regulatory action that requires additional liquidity at each of our subsidiaries could impede access to funds we need to pay our obligations or pay dividends in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors for more information regarding our ability to pay dividends see capital management in the mda on page and note shareholders equity to the consolidated financial statements in the event of a resolution whether in a bankruptcy proceeding or under the orderly liquidation authority of the fdic such resolution could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the ability to pay dividends to shareholders and to pay obligations bank of america corporation our parent holding company is required to periodically submit a plan to the fdic and federal reserve describing its resolution strategy under the us bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure in the current plan bank of america corporations preferred resolution strategy is a single point of entry strategy this strategy provides that only the parent holding company files for resolution under the us bankruptcy code and contemplates providing certain key operating subsidiaries with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of the parent holding company bank of america corporation has entered into intercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and liquidity to key subsidiaries pursuant to these arrangements if bank of america corporations liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent bank of america corporation will no longer be able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets to a whollyowned holding company subsidiary which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the ability to pay dividends to shareholders and meet our payment obligations if the fdic and federal reserve jointly determine that bank of america corporations resolution plan is not credible they could impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations further we could be required to take certain actions that could impose operating costs and could potentially result in the divestiture or restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries additionally under the financial reform act when a gsib such as bank of america corporation is in default or danger of default the fdic may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution in the event of such appointment the fdic could among other things invoke the orderly liquidation authority instead of the us bankruptcy code if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations in the fdic issued a notice describing its preferred single point of entry strategy for resolving a gsib under this approach the fdic could replace bank of america corporation with a bridge holding company which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors the fdics single point of entry strategy may result in our security holders suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy for more information about resolution planning see item business resolution planning on page for more information about the fdics orderly liquidation see item business insolvency and the orderly liquidation authority on page table start bank of america table end credit economic or market disruptions insufficient credit loss reserves or concentrations of credit risk may result in an increase in the provision for credit losses which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a number of our products expose us to credit risk including loans letters of credit derivatives debt securities trading account assets and assets heldforsale a deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers counterparties or underlying collateral could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations global and us economic conditions and macroeconomic or market events and disruptions including a continuing slowdown in global gdp growth a decline in consumer spending a decline in property values or an asset price correction increasing consumer and corporate leverage as well as rising unemployment fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest rates widespread health emergencies or pandemics andor natural disasters may impact our credit portfolios in addition significant economic or market stresses and disruptions could have a negative impact on the business environment and financial markets increasing the risk that borrowers or counterparties would default or become delinquent in their obligations to us which could lead to recessionary conditions andor increase our credit losses and provision for credit losses which could have a negative impact on our results of operations in particular increases in delinquencies and default rates could adversely affect our consumer credit card home equity and residential mortgage portfolios through increased chargeoffs and provision for credit losses a deteriorating economic environment in the us or globally could also adversely affect our consumer and commercial loan portfolios with weakened client and collateral positions simultaneous drawdowns on lines of credit andor an increase in a borrowers leverage in a weakening economic environment could result in deterioration in our credit portfolio should borrowers be unable to fulfill competing financial obligations the impact of this could also be magnified by lending to leveraged borrowers elevated asset prices andor declining property or collateral values unrelated to macroeconomic stress we estimate and establish an allowance for credit losses for losses inherent in our lending activities including unfunded lending commitments excluding those measured at fair value through a charge to earnings the process for determining the amount of the allowance requires us to make difficult and complex judgments including forecasting how borrowers will react to changing economic conditions the ability of our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations will likely be impacted by changes in future economic conditions which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates there is also the possibility that we will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators or that we will fail to accurately estimate their impacts to our borrowers and the reserves that we hold we may suffer unexpected losses if the models and assumptions we use to establish reserves and make judgments in extending credit to our borrowers or counterparties prove inaccurate in predicting future events in addition external factors such as the macroeconomic or market events disclosed above can also negatively impact our recognition of credit losses in our portfolios and impact our allowance for credit losses as of january we implemented a new accounting standard to estimate our allowance for credit losses for more information see note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements although we believe that the allowance for credit losses is in compliance with the new accounting standard at january there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address credit losses particularly if economic conditions deteriorate quickly andor significantly in such an event we may increase the size of our allowance which would reduce our earnings in the ordinary course of our business we also may be subject to concentrations of credit risk because of a common characteristic or common sensitivity to economic financial or business developments for example concentrations in credit risk may result in a particular industry geographic location product asset class counterparty individual exposure or within any pool of exposures with a common risk characteristic a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry geographic location product or asset class or a failure or downgrade of or default by any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses and it is possible our limits and credit monitoring exposure controls will not function as anticipated while our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokerdealers commercial banks investment banks insurers mutual funds and hedge funds central counterparties and other institutional clients this has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry financial services institutions and other counterparties are interrelated because of trading funding clearing or other relationships as a result defaults by or even market uncertainty about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally could lead to marketwide liquidity disruptions losses and defaults many of these transactions expose us to credit risk and in some cases disputes and litigation in the event of default of a counterparty in addition our credit risk may be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due to us which may occur as a result of fraud or other events that impact the value of the collateral further disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and we could suffer losses during such periods if we are unable to realize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral in the ordinary course of business we also enter into transactions with sovereign nations us states and us municipalities unfavorable economic or political conditions disruptions to capital markets currency fluctuations changes in oil prices social instability and changes in government or monetary policies could impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of these government entities and expose us to credit risk we also have concentrations of credit risk with respect to our consumer real estate auto consumer credit card and commercial real estate portfolios which represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio additionally decreases in home price valuations or commercial real estate valuations in certain markets where we have large concentrations including as a result of climate change or natural disasters eg rising sea levels hurricanes and fires as well as more broadly within the us or globally could result in increased defaults delinquencies or credit loss for more information see consumer portfolio credit risk management in the mda on page furthermore our commercial portfolios include exposures to certain industries including asset managers and funds real estate capital goods and finance companies for more information see commercial portfolio credit risk management in table start bank of america table end the mda on page economic weaknesses adverse business conditions market disruptions rising interest or capitalization rates the collapse of speculative bubbles greater volatility in areas where we have concentrated credit risk or deterioration in real estate values or household incomes may cause us to experience a decrease in cash flow and higher credit losses in either our consumer or commercial portfolios or cause us to write down the value of certain assets liquidity disruptions in the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of our positions leading to increased concentrations which could increase the credit and market risk associated with our positions as well as increase our riskweighted assets for more

and leases and note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements if the us housing market weakens or home prices decline our consumer loan portfolios credit quality credit losses representations and warranties exposures and earnings may be adversely affected while us home prices continued to generally increase in the rate of increase has slowed compared to recent periods we remain conscious of geographic markets where housing price growth has slowed or decreased and other geographic markets where housing prices have declined as further declines in future periods may negatively impact the demand for many of our products additionally our mortgage loan production volume is generally influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market both of which may be adversely affected by rising interest rates conditions in the us housing market during the most recent financial crisis resulted in both significant writedowns of asset values in several asset classes notably mortgagebacked securities and exposure to monolines if the us housing market were to weaken the value of real estate could decline which could result in increased credit losses and delinquent servicing expenses and negatively affect our representations and warranties exposures which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks and potential losses we are party to a large number of derivatives transactions that may expose us to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values unanticipated credit events or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account or anticipated in the development structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events such as a change in the credit rating of a particular bank of america entity or entities we may be required to provide additional collateral or take other remedial actions and could experience increased difficulty obtaining funding or hedging risks in some cases our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements we are also a member of various central counterparties ccps in part due to regulatory requirements for mandatory clearing of derivative transactions which potentially increases our credit risk exposures to ccps in the event that one or more members of the ccp defaults on its obligations we may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the ccp as a result of that default a ccp may modify in its discretion the margin we are required to post which could mean unexpected and increased exposure to the ccp as a clearing member we are exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our clients for which we clear transactions which may not be covered by available collateral additionally any default by a significant market participant may result in further risk and potential losses for more information on our derivatives exposure see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements geopolitical we are subject to numerous political economic market reputational operational legal regulatory and other risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate we do business throughout the world including in emerging markets economic or geopolitical stress in one or more countries could have a negative impact regionally or globally resulting in among other things market volatility reduced market value and economic output our businesses and revenues derived from nonus jurisdictions are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations financial social or judicial instability changes in government leadership including as a result of electoral outcomes or otherwise changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization andor confiscation of assets price controls high inflation natural disasters the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics capital controls currency redenomination risk exchange controls unfavorable political and diplomatic developments oil price fluctuations and changes in legislation additionally protectionist trade policies and continued trade tensions between the us and important trading partners particularly china and the eu including the risk that tariffs continue to rise and other restrictive actions are taken that weigh heavily on regional trade volumes and domestic demand through falling business sentiment and lower consumer confidence could adversely affect our businesses and revenues these risks are especially elevated in emerging markets a number of nonus jurisdictions in which we do business have been or may be negatively impacted by slowing growth or recessionary conditions market volatility andor political unrest in europe the political and economic environment remains challenging due to slowing gdp growth debt concerns of certain eu countries and elevated recessionary risks including in germany and the uk the current degree of european political and economic uncertainty could increase and create additional market volatility and negatively impact our business and results of operations significant market volatility and geopolitical unrest could also result from ongoing uncertainty related to the uks exit from the eu and the transition period during which the terms of such exit will be negotiated which could adversely affect us potential risks of default on or devaluation of sovereign debt in some nonus jurisdictions could expose us to substantial losses risks in one nation can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in other nations including our us operations market and economic disruptions of all types may affect consumer confidence levels and spending corporate investment and job creation bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer and corporate debt economic growth rates and asset values among other factors any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the corporation we also invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in nonus jurisdictions including emerging markets revenues from the trading of nonus securities may be table start bank of america table end subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors furthermore the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because nonus trading markets particularly in emerging markets are generally smaller less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets our nonus businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by governments securities exchanges and regulators central banks and other regulatory bodies in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our potential inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could result in increased expenses and changes to our organizational structure and have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations in that market as well as our reputation in general in addition to nonus legislation our international operations are also subject to us legal requirements for example our operations are subject to us and nonus laws and regulations relating to bribery and corruption antimoney laundering and economic sanctions which can vary by jurisdiction the increasing speed and novel ways in which funds circulate could make it more challenging to track the movement of funds and heightens financial crimes risk our ability to comply with these legal requirements depends on our ability to continually improve detection and reporting and analytic capabilities in the us debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns which have increased the possibility of us government defaults on its debt andor downgrades to its credit ratings and prolonged government shutdowns could negatively impact the global economy and banking system and adversely affect our financial condition including our liquidity additionally changes in fiscal monetary or regulatory policy could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business operations organizational structure and results of operations we are also subject to geopolitical risks including acts or threats of terrorism actions taken by the us or other governments in response thereto statesponsored cyber attacks or campaigns

business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties including their downstream service providers with whom we interact or upon whom we rely including a systematic cyber campaign that results in system outages and unavailability of part or all of the financial services industry infrastructure our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is more limited than with respect to our own systems in the event that backup systems are available and utilized they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been backed up we continuously update the systems on which we rely to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws rules and regulations globally this updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones including business interruptions a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure resulting in disruption to our critical business operations and customer services could expose us to regulatory market privacy and liquidity risk and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm a cyber attack information or security breach or a technology failure of ours or of a third party could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure and adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm our business is highly dependent on the security controls and efficacy of our infrastructure computer and data management systems as well as those of our customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties including their downstream service providers the financial services industry and financial data aggregators with whom we interact on whom we rely or who have access to our customers personal or account information our business relies on effective access management and the secure collection processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary personal and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties increasingly use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks we our employees and customers regulators and other third parties are regularly the target of cyber attacks and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks these cyber attacks are pervasive and evolving and include computer viruses malicious or destructive code such as ransomware phishing attacks denial of service or information or other security breach tactics that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction or theft of confidential proprietary and other information including intellectual property of ours our employees our customers or of third parties damages to systems or otherwise material disruption to our or our customers or other third parties network access or business operations both domestically and internationally as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents and develop our capabilities to respond and recover cyber threats are rapidly changing and despite substantial efforts to protect the integrity of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate cyber attacks or information or security breaches nor may we be able to implement effective preventive or defensive measures to address such attacks or breaches even the most advanced internal control environment is vulnerable to compromise internal access management failures could result in the compromise or unauthorized exposure of confidential data targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent our cybersecurity risk and exposure remains heightened because of among other things the evolving nature and pervasiveness of cyber threats our prominent size and scale our role in the financial services industry and the broader economy the financial services industry is particularly at risk because of the proliferation of new and emerging technologies including thirdparty financial data aggregators and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions for example our plans to continue our use of automation artificial intelligence and robotics increase our internet and mobile banking products including mobile payment and other web and cloudbased products and applications and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served increase our cybersecurity risks and exposure additionally our continuous transmission of sensitive information to and storage of such information by third parties including our vendors and regulators our geographic footprint and international presence the outsourcing of some of our business operations threats of cyber terrorism external extremist parties including statesponsored actors in some circumstances as a means to promote political ends and system and customer account updates and conversions result in heightened risk exposure as a result cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers intellectual property and proprietary information software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a critical priority cybersecurity risks have also significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increasingly sophisticated activities of organized crime groups hackers terrorist organizations hostile foreign governments disgruntled employees or vendors activists and other external parties including those involved in corporate espionage the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and these attacks or ensuing security breaches could persist for an extended period of time before being detected it could take considerable additional time for us to determine the scope extent amount and type of information compromised at which time the impact on the corporation and measures to recover and restore to a business as usual state may be difficult to assess we also face indirect technology cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers clients and other third parties including their downstream service providers and the financial services industry with whom we do business upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities or upon whom our customers rely such third parties also include financial counterparties financial data aggregators financial intermediaries such as clearing agents exchanges and clearing table start bank of america table end houses vendors regulators providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power and retailers for whom we process transactions as a result of increasing consolidation interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyber attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities or thirdparty or their downstream service providers could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants including us this consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure on both individual and industrywide bases as disparate systems need to be integrated often on an accelerated basis any technology failure cyber attack or other information or security breach termination or constraint of any third party including their downstream service providers the financial services industry infrastructure or financial data aggregators could among other things adversely affect our ability to conduct daytoday business activities effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses result in the misappropriation or destruction of the personal proprietary or confidential information of our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties or result in fraudulent or unauthorized transactions further any such event may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner although to date we have not experienced any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failure cyber attacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures in place to monitor and mitigate the risks of cyber threats will be sufficient and that we will not suffer material losses or consequences in the future cyber attacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties may result in significant lost revenue give rise to losses or have other negative consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyber attack on our systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business although we maintain cyber insurance there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate also successful penetration or circumvention of system security could result in negative consequences including loss of customers and business opportunities the withdrawal of customer deposits prolonged computer and network outages resulting in disruptions to our critical business operations and customer services misappropriation or destruction of our intellectual property proprietary information or confidential information andor the confidential proprietary or personal information of certain parties such as our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties or damage to their computers

measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and our internal controls or disclosure controls being rendered ineffective the occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition our mortgage loan repurchase obligations or claims from third parties could result in additional losses we and our legacy companies have sold significant amounts of residential mortgage loans in connection with these sales we or certain of our subsidiaries or legacy companies made various representations and warranties breaches of which may result in a requirement that we repurchase the mortgage loans or otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties at december we had billion of unresolved repurchase claims net of duplicate claims and excluding claims where the statute of limitations has expired without litigation being commenced at december our liability for obligations under representations and warranties exposures was billion we also have an estimated range of possible loss rpl for representations and warranties exposures that is combined with the litigation rpl which we disclose in note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements the recorded liability and estimated rpl are based on currently available information significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change there can be no assurance that the corporation will reach future settlements or if it does that the terms of past settlements can be relied upon to predict the terms of future settlements future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of our recorded liability and estimated rpl and such losses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations additionally our recorded liability for representations and warranties exposures and the corresponding estimated rpl do not consider

residential mortgage securitizations and residential mortgage loans owned by other entities along with other losses we could incur in our capacity as servicer could harm our reputation increase servicing costs or adversely impact our results of operations we and our legacy companies service mortgage loans on behalf of thirdparty securitization vehicles and other investors if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice which could cause us to lose servicing income in addition we may have liability for any failure by us as a servicer or master servicer for any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of our duties if any such breach was found to have occurred it may harm our reputation increase our servicing costs or adversely impact our results of operations additionally with respect to foreclosures we may incur costs or losses due to irregularities in the underlying documentation or if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or overturned by a court because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process we may also incur costs or losses relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosure changes in the structure of the gses and the relationship among the gses the government and the private markets could result in changes to our business operations and may adversely impact our business during we sold approximately billion of loans to fannie mae fnma and freddie mac fhlmc each is currently in a conservatorship with its primary regulator the federal housing table start bank of america table end finance agency fhfa acting as conservator in september the treasury department published a proposal to recapitalize fnma and fhlmc and remove them from conservatorship as well as reduce gses role in the marketplace there can be no assurance that these proposals will be fully adopted and it is not possible to predict when the conservatorships will end if gses were to take a reduced role in the marketplace including by limiting the mortgage products they offer we could be required to seek alternative funding sources retain additional loans on our balance sheet secure funding through the federal home loan bank system or securitize the loans through private label securitization although the treasury department has released an administrative proposal and the fhfa has taken steps to unify underwriting parameters and create a common securitization platform we cannot predict the prospects for the enactment timing of the recapitalization or release from conservatorship or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the gses in the housing market accordingly uncertainty regarding their future continues to exist any of these developments could adversely affect the value of our securities portfolios capital levels and liquidity and results of operations our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us we seek to effectively and consistently identify measure monitor report and control the types of risk to which we are subject including strategic credit market liquidity compliance operational and reputational risks while we employ a broad and diversified set of controls and risk mitigation techniques including modeling and forecasting hedging strategies and techniques that seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses our ability to control and mitigate risks that result in losses is inherently limited by our ability to identify all risks including emerging and unknown risks anticipate the timing of risks apply effective hedging strategies make correct assumptions manage and aggregate data correctly and efficiently and develop risk management models to assess and control risk our ability to manage risk is limited by our ability to consistently execute all elements of our risk management program and develop and maintain a culture of managing risk well throughout the corporation and manage risks associated with third parties their downstream service providers and vendors to enable effective risk management and ensure that risks are appropriately considered evaluated and responded to in a timely manner uncertain economic conditions heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of and change within the financial services industry the pace of technological changes accounting and market developments the failure of employees to comply with policies values and our risk framework and the overall complexity of our operations among other developments may result in a heightened level of risk for us accordingly we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to manage change or properly anticipate manage control or mitigate risks for more information about our risk management policies and procedures see managing risk in the mda on page regulatory compliance and legal we are subject to comprehensive government legislation and regulations both domestically and internationally which impact our operating costs and could require us to make changes to our operations additionally we are subject to certain settlements orders and agreements with government authorities from time to time which could increase our compliance and operational risks and costs we are subject to comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the us and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate including increasing and complex economic sanctions regimes these laws and regulations significantly affect and have the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities including the products and services we offer reduce certain fees and rates or make our products and services more expensive for clients and customers we continue to make adjustments to our business and operations legal entity structure and capital and liquidity management policies procedures and controls to comply with currently effective laws and regulations as well as final rulemaking guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities including the department of treasury federal reserve occ cfpb financial stability oversight council fdic department of labor sec and cftc in the us and foreign regulators and other government authorities further we could become subject to future regulatory requirements beyond those currently proposed adopted or contemplated including rulemaking related to the financial reform act and the uks exit from the eu the cumulative effect of all of the legislation and regulations on our business operations and profitability remains uncertain this uncertainty necessitates that in our business planning we make certain assumptions with respect to the scope and requirements of the proposed rules if these assumptions prove incorrect we could be subject to increased regulatory and compliance risks and costs as well as potential reputational harm in addition us and international regulatory initiatives may overlap and nonus regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed us regulations which could lead to compliance risks and increased costs our regulators prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct our actions and they have assumed an active oversight inspection and investigatory role across the financial services industry however regulatory focus is not limited to laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry specifically but also extends to other significant laws and regulations that apply across industries and jurisdictions including those related to data management and privacy antimoney laundering anticorruption and economic sanctions additionally we are subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and abroad including gdpr and ccpa regarding compliance with our privacy policies and the disclosure collection use sharing and safeguarding of personal identifiable information of certain parties such as our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties the violation of which could result in litigation regulatory fines and enforcement actions additionally we will likely be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the us and abroad which could result in additional costs of compliance litigation regulatory fines and enforcement actions as part of their enforcement authority our regulators and other government authorities have the authority to among other things assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties or restitution and issue cease and desist or removal orders and initiate injunctive actions the amounts paid by us and other financial institutions to settle proceedings or investigations have in some instances been substantial and may increase in some cases governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such resolutions which could have significant consequences including reputational harm loss of customers restrictions on the ability to access capital markets and the table start bank of america table end inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time the corporation and the conduct of its employees and representatives are subject to regulatory scrutiny across jurisdictions additionally the complexity of the federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes in the us coupled with the global scope of our operations and the aggressiveness of the regulatory environment worldwide also means that a single event or practice or a series of related events or practices may give rise to a significant number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies in the us or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions additionally actions by other members of the financial services industry related to business activities in which we participate may result in investigations by regulators or other government authorities responding to inquiries investigations lawsuits and proceedings regardless of the ultimate outcome of the matter is timeconsuming and expensive and can divert the attention of our senior management from our business the outcome of such proceedings which may last a number of years may be difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings we are currently subject to the terms of settlements orders and agreements that we have entered into with government entities and regulatory authorities and may become subject to additional settlements orders or agreements in the future such settlements orders or agreements can impose significant operational and compliance costs on us as they typically require us to enhance our procedures and controls expand our risk and control functions within our lines of business invest in technology and hire significant numbers of additional risk control and compliance personnel moreover if we fail to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements orders or agreements to which we are subject or more generally fail to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by our regulators and other government authorities we could be required to enter into further settlements orders or agreements and pay additional fines penalties or judgments or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to identify assess monitor and report on applicable laws policies and procedures compliance risks will continue to exist particularly as we adapt to new and evolving laws rules and regulations additionally changing us fiscal monetary and regulatory policies arising from potential changes to the us presidential administration and congress result in ongoing regulatory uncertainties there is no guarantee that our risk management and compliance programs will be consistently executed to successfully manage compliance risk we also rely upon third parties who may expose us to compliance and legal risk future legislative or regulatory actions and any required changes to our business or operations or those of third parties including their downstream providers upon whom we rely resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue impose additional compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce our profitability limit the products and services that we offer or our ability to pursue certain business opportunities require us to dispose of or curtail certain businesses affect the value of assets that we hold require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products or otherwise adversely affect our businesses in addition legal and regulatory proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time that may result in fines regulatory sanctions penalties equitable relief and changes to our business practices as a result we are and will continue to be subject to heightened compliance and operating costs that could adversely affect our results of operations we are subject to significant financial and reputational risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits and regulatory and government action we face significant legal risks in our business and the volume of claims and amount of damages penalties and fines claimed in litigation and other disputes and regulatory and government proceedings against us and other financial institutions continue to be high greater than expected litigation and investigation costs substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or government action against us could have adverse effects on our business financial

for contractual indemnification with counterparties regarding relative rights and responsibilities consumers clients and other counterparties continue to be litigious among other things financial institutions including us continue to be the subject of claims alleging anticompetitive conduct with respect to various products and markets including us antitrust class actions claiming joint and several liability for treble damages in addition regulatory authorities have had a supervisory focus on enforcement including in connection with alleged violations of law and customer harm for example us regulators and government agencies have pursued claims against financial institutions under the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act false claims act equal credit opportunity act fair housing act and antitrust laws such claims may carry significant and in certain cases treble damages the global environment of extensive regulation regulatory compliance burdens litigation and regulatory and government enforcement combined with uncertainty related to the continually evolving regulatory environment may affect operational and compliance costs and risks which may limit or

commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements us federal banking agencies may require us to increase our regulatory capital tlac longterm debt or liquidity requirements which could result in the need to issue additional qualifying securities or to take other actions such as to sell company assets we are subject to us regulatory capital and liquidity rules these rules among other things establish minimum requirements to qualify as a wellcapitalized institution if any of our subsidiary insured depository institutions fails to maintain its status as well capitalized under the applicable regulatory capital rules the federal reserve will require us to agree to bring the insured depository institution back to wellcapitalized status for the duration of such an agreement the federal reserve may impose restrictions on our activities if we were to fail to enter into or comply with such an agreement or fail to comply with the terms of such agreement the federal reserve may impose more severe restrictions on our activities including requiring us to cease and desist activities permitted under the bank holding company act of capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended it is possible that regulators may increase regulatory capital requirements including tlac and longterm debt requirements change how regulatory capital is calculated or table start bank of america table end increase liquidity requirements our gsib surcharge may increase from current estimates and we are also subject to a countercyclical capital buffer which while currently set at zero may be increased by regulators in the federal reserve issued a proposal to implement a stress capital buffer into its capital requirements which may increase our regulatory capital requirements if adopted a significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our riskweighted assets and our leverage exposure which may increase the basel committee on banking supervision has also revised several key methodologies for measuring riskweighted assets including a standardized approach for credit risk standardized approach for operational risk and constraints on the use of internal models as well as a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches us banking regulators may update the us basel rules to incorporate the basel committee revisions additionally net stable funding ratio requirements have been proposed which would apply to us and our subsidiary depository institutions and target longer term liquidity risk while the impact of these proposals remains uncertain they could have a negative impact on our capital and liquidity positions in us banking regulators published a final rule outlining a standardized approach for counterparty credit risk which updates the calculation of the exposure amount for derivative contracts under the regulatory capital rule the final rule will be effective on april with a mandatory compliance date of january this rule could have a negative impact on our capital position upon final implementation as part of its annual ccar the federal reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the federal reserve those scenarios may affect our ccar stress test results which may have an effect on our projected regulatory capital amounts in the annual ccar submission including the ccar capital plan affecting our dividends and stock repurchases such ability to return capital to our shareholders substantially depends on the federal reserves response to our annual ccar submission to the extent that the federal reserve objects to our annual ccar submission or objects to the amount of dividends or stock repurchases proposed our shareholder returns could decrease changes to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets increase borrowings issue additional equity or other securities cease or alter certain operations sell company assets or hold highly liquid assets which may adversely affect our results of operations we may be prohibited

regulatory capital in the mda on page and note regulatory requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain if those assumptions estimates or judgments were incorrectly made we could be required to correct and restate priorperiod financial statements accounting standardsetters and those who interpret the accounting standards the sec banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied these changes may be difficult to predict and could impact how we prepare and report our financial statements in

policies and recent accounting changes see complex accounting estimates in the mda on page and note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements we may be adversely affected by changes in us and nonus tax laws and regulations in december the president signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which made significant changes to federal income tax law including among other things reducing the statutory corporate income tax rate to percent from percent and changing the taxation of our nonus business activities in addition we have uk net deferred tax assets which consist primarily of net operating losses that are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors such as prolonged worsening of europes capital markets or changes in the ability of our uk subsidiaries to conduct business in the eu could lead our management to reassess andor change its current conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to our uk net deferred tax assets it is possible that governmental authorities in the us andor other countries could further amend tax laws in a way that would adversely affect us including the possibility that aspects of the tax act could be amended in the future reputation damage to our reputation could harm our businesses including our competitive position and business prospects our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and employees is impacted by our reputation harm to our reputation can arise from various sources including officer director or employee misconduct unethical behavior security breaches litigation or regulatory outcomes compensation practices the suitability or reasonableness of recommending particular trading or investment strategies including the reliability of our research and models and prohibiting clients from engaging in certain

or clients in our possession or in the possession of third parties including their downstream service providers or financial data aggregators is mishandled misused or mismanaged or if we do not timely or adequately address such information we may face regulatory reputational and operational risks which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we could suffer reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to use our products and services or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues such as operational risks gives rise to reputational risk that could harm us and our business prospects failure to appropriately address any of these issues

or subject us to enforcement actions fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses for more information on reputational risk see reputational risk management in the mda on page other we face significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry we operate in a highly competitive environment and experience intense competition from local and global financial institutions as well as new entrants in both domestic and foreign markets in which we compete on the basis of a number of factors including customer service quality and range of products and services offered technology price reputation interest rates on loans and deposits lending limits and customer convenience additionally the changing regulatory environment may create competitive disadvantages for us given geographydriven capital and liquidity requirements for example us regulators have in certain instances adopted stricter capital and liquidity requirements than those applicable to nonus institutions to the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients regulators and industry participants in the relevant market which could adversely affect our ability to compete in addition emerging technologies and advances and the growth of ecommerce have lowered geographic and monetary barriers of other financial institutions made it easier for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and allowed nontraditional financial service providers and technology companies to compete with traditional financial service companies in providing electronic and internetbased financial solutions and services including electronic securities trading marketplace lending financial data aggregation and payment processing including realtime payment platforms further clients may choose to conduct business with other market participants who engage in business or offer products in areas we deem speculative or risky such as cryptocurrencies increased competition may negatively affect our earnings by creating pressure to lower prices or credit standards on our products and services requiring additional investment to improve the quality and delivery of our technology andor reducing our market share or affecting the willingness of our clients to do business with us our inability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences could harm our business our business model is based on a diversified mix of businesses that provide a broad range of financial products and services delivered through multiple distribution channels our success depends on our and our thirdparty vendors ability to adapt and develop products services and technology to rapidly evolving industry standards and consumer preferences there is increasing pressure by competitors to provide products and services on more attractive terms including higher interest rates on deposits and offer lower cost investment strategies which may impact our ability to grow revenue andor effectively compete additionally legislative and regulatory developments may affect the competitive landscape further the competitive landscape may be impacted by the growth of nondepository institutions that offer traditional banking products at higher rates or with no fees or otherwise offer alternative products this can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our feebased products and services either from a decrease in the volume of transactions or through a compression of spreads in addition the widespread adoption and rapid evolution of new technologies including analytic capabilities selfservice digital trading platforms internet services distributed ledgers such as the blockchain system cryptocurrencies and payment systems could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our online and mobile banking channel strategies in addition to remote connectivity solutions we may not be as timely or successful in developing or introducing new products and services integrating new products or services into our existing offerings responding or adapting to changes in consumer behavior preferences spending investing andor saving habits achieving market acceptance of our products and services reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers our or our thirdparty vendors inability to adapt products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and reputation our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and failure to do so could hurt our business prospects and competitive position our performance is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals competition for qualified personnel within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry is intense our competitors include nonus based institutions and institutions subject to different compensation and hiring regulations than those imposed on us institutions and financial institutions in order to attract and retain qualified personnel we must provide marketlevel compensation as a large financial and banking institution we may be subject to limitations on compensation practices which may or may not affect our competitors by the federal reserve the occ the fdic and other regulators around the world eu and uk rules limit and subject table start bank of america table end to clawback certain forms of variable compensation for senior employees current and potential future limitations on executive compensation imposed by legislation or regulation could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain qualified employees furthermore a substantial portion of our annual incentive compensation paid to our senior employees has in recent years taken the form of longterm equitybased awards therefore the ultimate value of this compensation depends on the price of our common stock when the

historical trends and simplifying assumptions uncertainty regarding economic and financial outcomes an d emerging risks from the use of applications that rely on artificial intelligence our models and strategies may not be sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited historical patterns extreme or unanticipated market movem ents or customer behavior and illiquidity especially during severe market downturns or stress events which could limit their effectiveness the models that we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators which may not be representative of the next downturn and would magnify the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk our models may not be effective if we fail to properly oversee them and detect their flaws during our review and monitoring processes they contain erroneous data assumptions valuations formulas or algorithms or our applications running the models do not perform as expected regardless of the steps we take to ensure effective controls governance monitoring and testing and implement

daytoday operations the failure to establish and maintain effective efficient and controlled data management could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop our products and relationships with our customers and damage our reputation reforms to and uncertainty regarding ibors including the london interbank offered rate libor and certain other rates or indices may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and could result in reputational harm to the corporation in the uk fca announced that it will no longer persuade or require participating banks to submit rates for libor after the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after and there is substantial risk that libor will be modified by or discontinued thereafter this announcement in conjunction with financial benchmark reforms and changes in shortterm interbank lending markets more generally have resulted in significant uncertainty about the potential or actual discontinuation of ibors including libor and certain other rates or indices that serve as benchmarks such benchmarks are used extensively in the global financial markets and in our business in particular libor is used in many of our products and contracts including mortgages consumer commercial and corporate loans derivatives floatingrate notes and other adjustablerate products and financial instruments the aggregate notional amount of these products and contracts is material to our business these reforms and actions may result in significant uncertainty as to future rules or methodologies used to calculate benchmarks cause new or reformed benchmarks to perform differently from the discontinued benchmarks they are replacing cause existing benchmarks to disappear or become unavailable or unrepresentative or have other consequences that cannot be fully anticipated which expose us to various financial operational and legal risks certain arrs have been proposed to replace libor and other ibors for example the alternative reference rates committee a group of privatemarket participants and officialsector entities convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york has recommended that the secured overnight financing rate sofr replace us dollar libor however the market transition from ibors to arrs is complex and pervasive throughout a number of different types of products and global financial markets there can be no assurance that arrs will be adequate alternatives to ibors that existing assets and liabilities based on or linked to ibors will transition successfully to arrs of the timing of adoption and degree of integration and acceptance of such arrs in the global financial markets or of the future availability or representativeness of such arrs our products and contracts that reference ibors in particular libor may contain language that determines when a successor rate including the arr andor the applicable spread adjustment to the designated rate including ibors would be selected or determined if a trigger is satisfied our products and contracts may give the calculation agent which may be us discretion over the successor rate to be selected the considerable uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuation of ibors andor such ibors ceasing to be acceptable reference rates in financial instruments could ultimately result in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our iborbased products and contracts accordingly uncertainty regarding arrs may continue to impact our business operations and financial condition repeatedly and indefinitely the discontinuation of ibors including libor will require us to remediate iborbased products and contracts including related hedging arrangements that mature after the discontinuation date of the ibor these changes may adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us amounts paid on securities we have table start bank of america table end issued amounts received and paid on derivatives we have entered into the value of such loans securities or derivative instruments the trading market for such products and contracts and our ability to effectively use hedging instruments to manage risk while some of these outstanding iborbased products and contracts include fallback provisions to arrs some of our outstanding iborbased products and contracts do not include fallback provisions or adequate fallback mechanisms requiring remediation to modify their terms additionally some outstanding iborbased products and contracts are particularly challenging to modify due to the requirement that all impacted parties consent to such modification in light of the extensive use of iborbased products and contracts by us and other market participants there can be no assurance that we and other market participants will be able to successfully modify all outstanding iborbased products and contracts or be adequately prepared for a discontinuation of an ibor at the time such ibor may cease to be published or otherwise discontinued also there can be no assurance that existing or new provisions for successor rates in our iborbased products and contracts will include adequate methodologies for adjustments between the applicable ibor and the corresponding successor rate or that the characteristics of the successor rates will be similar to or produce the economic equivalent of the benchmarks they seek to replace for example sofr and other arrs have compositions and characteristics that differ significantly from the benchmarks they may replace have limited history and may demonstrate less predictable performance over time than the benchmarks they replace changes or uncertainty resulting from the market transition from ibors to arrs could adversely affect the return on and pricing liquidity and value of outstanding iborbased products and contracts cause significant market dislocations and disruptions that are relevant to our business segments particularly global banking and global markets potentially increase the cost of and access to capital increase the risk of litigation or other disputes including in connection with the interpretation and enforceability of or our historical marketing practices or disclosures with respect to outstanding iborbased products and contracts with counterparties andor increase expenses related to the transition to arrs among other adverse consequences additionally the process of transitioning to arrs may result in increased costs and may also divert management time and attention from other areas of our business the market transition from ibors to arrs may also alter our risk profile and risk management strategies including derivatives and hedging strategies modeling and analytics valuation tools product design and systems controls procedures and operational infrastructure this may prove challenging given the limited history of many of the proposed arrs and may increase the costs and risks related to potential regulatory compliance requirements or inquiries among other risks various products and contracts may transition to arrs at different times or in different manners with the result that we may face significant unexpected interest rate pricing or other exposures across business or product lines reforms to and uncertainty regarding market transition from current ibors to arrs and other factors including the pace of the transition to arrs the specific terms and parameters for market acceptance of any arrs prices of and liquidity of trading markets for products based on arrs and our ability to transition and develop appropriate systems and analytics for one or more arrs may adversely affect our business including the ability to serve customers and maintain market share financial condition or results of operations and could result in reputational harm to the corporation
