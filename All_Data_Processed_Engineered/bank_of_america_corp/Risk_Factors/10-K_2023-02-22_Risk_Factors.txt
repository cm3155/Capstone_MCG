item risk factors the discussion below addresses our material risk factors of which we are aware any risk factor either by itself or together with other risk factors could materially and adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows andor financial condition references to third parties may include their upstream and downstream service providers who may also contribute to our risks other factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also adversely affect our businesses results of operations cash flows andor financial condition therefore the risk factors below should not be considered all of the potential risks that we may face for more information on how we manage risks see managing risk in the mda on page for more information about the risks contained in the risk factors section see item business on page mda on page and notes to consolidated financial statements on page market we may be adversely affected by the financial markets fiscal monetary and regulatory policies and economic conditions general economic political social and health conditions in the us and abroad affect financial markets and our business in particular global markets may be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates availability and market conditions of financing changes in gross domestic product gdp economic growth or its sustainability inflation supply chain disruptions consumer spending employment levels labor shortages challenging labor market conditions wage stagnation federal government shutdowns energy prices home prices commercial property values bankruptcies a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties including companies in emerging markets fluctuations or other significant changes in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies liquidity the continued transition from interbank offered rates ibors and other benchmark rates to alternative reference rates arrs the impact of volatility of digital assets on the broader market the growth of global trade and commerce trade policies the availability and cost of capital and credit disruption of communication transportation or energy infrastructure recessionary fears and investor sentiment global markets including energy and commodity markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change acute andor chronic extreme weather events or natural disasters the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics cyberattacks military conflict terrorism or other geopolitical events market fluctuations may impact our margin requirements and affect our liquidity any sudden or prolonged market downturn as a result of the above factors or otherwise could result in a decline in net interest income and noninterest income and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition including capital and liquidity levels high inflation elevated interest rate levels supply chain disruptions and the russiaukraine conflict including the related energy impact in europe have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact financial markets and macroeconomic conditions and could result in additional market volatility and disruptions global uncertainties regarding fiscal and monetary policies present economic challenges actions taken by the federal reserve or other central banks including changes in target rates balance sheet management and lending facilities are beyond our control and difficult to predict particularly in a high inflation environment this can affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments and other assets such as debt securities and impact our borrowers and potentially increase delinquency rates and may also raise government debt levels adversely affect businesses and household incomes and increase uncertainty surrounding monetary policy monetary policy in response to high inflation has led to a significant increase in market interest rates and a flattening andor inversion of the yield curve this has resulted in and may continue to result in volatility of equity and other markets further volatility of the us dollar a widening in credit spreads and higher interest rates and recessionary concerns and could result in elevated unemployment which could impact investor risk appetite and our borrowers potentially increasing delinquency rates it is also possible that high inflation may limit the scope of monetary support including cuts to the federal funds rate in the event of an economic downturn resulting in a more protracted period of a flat andor inverted yield curve any future change in monetary policy by the federal reserve in an effort to stimulate the economy or otherwise resulting in lower interest rates would likely result in lower revenue through lower net interest income which could adversely affect our results of operations additionally changes to existing us laws and regulatory policies and evolving priorities including those related to financial regulation taxation international trade fiscal policy climate change including efforts to transition to a lowcarbon economy and healthcare may adversely impact us or global economic activity and our customers our counterparties and our earnings and operations globally many central banks are simultaneously reducing monetary accommodation through interest rate or balance sheet policy which has contributed and may continue to contribute to elevated financial and capital market volatility and significant changes to asset values while higher interest rates have positively impacted our net interest income higher interest rates have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact deposits loan demand and funding costs if the us governments debt ceiling limit is not raised the ramifications could result in market volatility ratings downgrades and limit fiscal policy responses to recessionary conditions this could have a negative and potentially severe impact on the us and world economy and financial and capital markets including higher interest rates higher volatility lower asset values lower liquidity downgrades to us debt and a weakened us dollar changes to international trade and investment policies by the us could negatively impact financial markets escalation of tensions between the us and the peoples republic of china china could lead to further us measures that adversely affect financial markets disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation including through the use of tariffs foreign exchange measures or the largescale sale of us treasury bonds any restrictions on the activities of businesses could also negatively affect financial markets these developments could adversely affect our businesses customers securities and derivatives portfolios including the risk of lower reinvestment rates within those portfolios our level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses the carrying value of our deferred tax assets our capital levels our liquidity and our results of operations increased market volatility and adverse changes in financial or capital market conditions may increase our market risk our liquidity competitive position business results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest and currency exchange rates fluctuations in equity commodity and futures prices trading volumes and prices of securitized products the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and table start bank of america table end business factors these market risks may adversely affect among other things the value of our securities including our on and offbalance sheet securities trading assets and other financial instruments the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets the value of assets under management aum fee income relating to aum customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives the volume of client activity in our trading operations investment banking underwriting and other capital market fees which have already been negatively impacted the general profitability and risk level of the transactions in which we engage and our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing the value of certain of our assets is sensitive to changes in market interest rates if the federal reserve or a nonus central bank changes or signals a change in monetary policy market interest rates or credit spreads could be affected which could adversely impact the value of such assets changes to fiscal policy including expansion of us federal deficit spending and resultant debt issuance could also affect market interest rates if interest rates decrease our results of operations could be negatively impacted including future revenue and earnings growth the continued flattening andor inversion of the yield curve could also negatively impact our results of operations including revenue and earnings our models and strategies to assess and control our market risk exposures are subject to inherent limitations in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated and vice versa such changes to the relationship between market parameters may limit the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and cause us to incur significant losses changes in correlation can be exacerbated where market participants use risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms similar to ours in these and other cases it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists where we own securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging or where the degree of accessible liquidity declines significantly we may not be able to reduce our positions and risks associated with such holdings so we may suffer larger than expected losses when adverse price movements take place this risk can be exacerbated where we hold a position that is large relative to the available liquidity if asset values decline we may incur losses and negative impacts to capital and liquidity requirements we have a large portfolio of financial instruments including loans and loan commitments securities financing agreements assetbacked secured financings derivative assets and liabilities debt securities marketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value and are subject to valuation and impairment assessments we determine these values based on applicable accounting guidance which for financial instruments measured at fair value requires an entity to base fair value on exit price and to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements the fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity credit quality funding impact on certain derivatives and other transactionspecific factors where appropriate gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct impact on our results of operations unless we have effectively hedged our exposures increases in interest rates may result in further decreases in residential mortgage loan originations and could impact the origination of corporate debt in addition increases in interest rates or changes in spreads may continue to adversely impact the fair value of debt securities and accordingly for debt securities classified as available for sale may continue to adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and thus capital levels these market moves could also adversely impact our regulatory liquidity requirements any decreases in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds of certain assets and therefore could adversely affect net interest income changes in interest rates also may impact the value of mortgage service rights retained fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions or indices the financial strength of counterparties with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets also will affect the fair value of these assets sudden declines and volatility in the prices of assets may curtail or eliminate trading activities in these assets which may make it difficult to sell hedge or value these assets the inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our riskweighted assets rwa which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs values of aum also impact revenues in our wealth management and related advisory businesses for assetbased management and performance fees declines in values of aum can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets liquidity if we are unable to access the capital markets have prolonged net deposits outflows or our borrowing costs increase our liquidity and competitive position will be negatively affected liquidity is essential to our businesses we fund our assets primarily with globally sourced deposits in our bank entities as well as secured and unsecured liabilities transacted in the capital markets we rely on certain secured funding sources such as repo markets which are typically shortterm and creditsensitive we also engage in asset securitization transactions including with the governmentsponsored enterprises gses to fund consumer lending activities our liquidity could be adversely affected by any inability to access the capital markets illiquidity or volatility in the capital markets the decrease in value of eligible collateral or increased collateral requirements including as a result of credit concerns for shortterm borrowing changes to our relationships with our funding providers based on real or perceived changes in our risk profile prolonged federal government shutdowns or changes in regulations guidance or gse status that impact our funding additionally our liquidity or cost of funds may be negatively impacted by the unwillingness or inability of the federal reserve to act as lender of last resort unexpected simultaneous draws on lines of credit slower customer payment rates restricted access to the assets of prime brokerage clients the withdrawal of or failure to attract customer deposits or invested funds which could result from attrition driven by customers seeking higher yielding deposits or securities products customer desire to utilize an alternative financial institution perceived to be safer changes in customer spending behavior due to inflation decline in the economy or other drivers resulting in an increased need for cash increased regulatory liquidity capital and margin requirements for our us or international banks and their nonbank subsidiaries which could result in the inability to transfer liquidity internally and inefficient funding changes in patterns of intraday liquidity usage resulting from a counterparty or technology failure or other idiosyncratic event or failure or table start bank of america table end default by a significant market participant or third party including clearing agents custodians central banks or central counterparty clearinghouses ccps these factors also have the potential to increase our borrowing costs and negatively impact our liquidity several of these factors may arise due to circumstances beyond our control such as general market volatility disruption shock or stress the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics federal reserve policy decisions including fluctuations in interest rates or federal reserve balance sheet composition negative views or loss of confidence about us or the financial services industry generally or due to a specific news event changes in the regulatory environment or governmental fiscal or monetary policies actions by credit rating agencies or an operational problem that affects third parties or us the impact of these potentially sudden events whether within our control or not could include an inability to sell assets or redeem investments unforeseen outflows of cash the need to draw on liquidity facilities the reduction of financing balances and the loss of equity secured funding debt repurchases to support the secondary market or meet client requests the need for additional funding for commitments and contingencies and unexpected collateral calls among other things the result of which could be increased costs a liquidity shortfall andor impact on our liquidity coverage ratio our liquidity and cost of obtaining funding may be directly related to investor behavior debt market disruption firm specific concerns or prevailing market conditions including changes in interest and currency exchange rates significant fluctuations in equity and futures prices lower trading volumes and prices of securitized products and our credit spreads increases in interest rates and our credit spreads can increase the cost of our funding and result in marktomarket or credit valuation adjustment exposures changes in our credit spreads are market driven and may be influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness including changes in our credit ratings or changes in broader financial market and macroeconomic conditions changes to interest rates and our credit spreads occur continuously and may be unpredictable and highly volatile we may also experience net interest margin compression as a result of offering higher than expected deposit rates in order to attract and maintain deposits concentrations within our funding profile such as maturities currencies or counterparties can reduce our funding efficiency reduction in our credit ratings could limit our access to funding or the capital markets increase borrowing costs or trigger additional collateral or funding requirements our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings credit ratings may also be important to investors customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and seek to engage in certain transactions including overthecounter otc derivatives our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by rating agencies which consider a number of financial and nonfinancial factors including our franchise financial strength performance and prospects management governance risk management practices capital adequacy asset quality and operations among other criteria as well as factors not under our control such as regulatory developments the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and changes to the methodologies used to determine our ratings or ratings generally rating agencies could make adjustments to our credit ratings at any time and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any downgrades could occur a reduction in our credit ratings could result in a wider credit spread and negatively affect our liquidity access to credit markets the related cost of funds our businesses and certain trading revenues particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical if the shortterm credit ratings of our parent company or bank or brokerdealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels we may experience loss of access to shortterm funding sources such as repo financing andor incur increased cost of funds and increased collateral requirements under the terms of certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements if our or our subsidiaries credit ratings are downgraded the counterparties may require additional collateral or terminate these contracts or agreements while certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable the full consequences of a credit rating downgrade are inherently uncertain and depend upon numerous dynamic complex and interrelated factors and assumptions including the relationship between longterm and shortterm credit ratings and the behaviors of customers investors and counterparties bank of america corporation is a holding company is dependent on its subsidiaries for liquidity and may be restricted from transferring funds from subsidiaries bank of america corporation as the parent company is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries we evaluate and manage liquidity on a legal entity basis legal entity liquidity is an important consideration as there are legal regulatory contractual and other limitations on our ability to utilize liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity requirements of another including the parent company which could result in adverse liquidity events the parent company depends on dividends distributions loans and other payments from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our preferred stock and common stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations including debt obligations any inability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds pay dividends or make payments to us may adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition many of our subsidiaries including our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to the parent company or other subsidiaries our bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements and restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses intercompany arrangements we entered into in connection with our resolution planning submissions could restrict the amount of funding available to the parent company from our subsidiaries under certain adverse conditions additional restrictions on related party transactions increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts as well as lower earnings can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of the parent company and even require the parent company to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries also regulatory action that requires additional liquidity at each of our subsidiaries could impede access to funds we need to pay our obligations or pay dividends in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors table start bank of america table end bank of america corporations liquidity and financial condition and the ability to pay dividends and obligations could be adversely affected in the event of a resolution bank of america corporation our parent holding company is required to periodically submit a plan to the fdic and federal reserve describing its resolution strategy under the us bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure bank of america corporations preferred resolution strategy is a single point of entry strategy whereby only the parent holding company would file for bankruptcy under the us bankruptcy code certain key operating subsidiaries would be provided with sufficient capital and liquidity to operate through severe stress and to enable such subsidiaries to continue operating or be wound down in a solvent manner following a bankruptcy of the parent holding company bank of america corporation has entered into intercompany arrangements resulting in the contribution of most of its capital and liquidity to key subsidiaries pursuant to these arrangements if bank of america corporations liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution becomes imminent it will no longer be able to draw liquidity from its key subsidiaries and will be required to contribute its remaining financial assets to a whollyowned holding company subsidiary this could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition including the ability to meet our payment obligations and the ability to return capital to shareholders including through the payment of dividends and repurchase of the corporations common stock if the fdic and federal reserve jointly determine that bank of america corporations resolution plan is not credible they could impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations we could also be required to take certain actions that could impose operating costs and result in the divestiture of assets or restructuring of businesses and subsidiaries when a gsib such as bank of america corporation is in default or danger of default the fdic may be appointed receiver to conduct an orderly liquidation and could among other things invoke the orderly liquidation authority instead of the us bankruptcy code if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations additionally the fdic could replace bank of america corporation with a bridge holding company which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank but whose equity would be held solely for the benefit of our creditors the fdics single point of entry strategy may result in our security holders suffering greater losses than would have been the case under a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy if the corporation is resolved under the us bankruptcy code or the fdics orderly liquidation authority thirdparty creditors of the corporations subsidiaries may receive significant or full recoveries on their claims while security holders of bank of america corporation could face significant or complete losses credit economic or market disruptions and insufficient credit loss reserves may result in a higher provision for credit losses a number of our products expose us to credit risk including loans letters of credit derivatives debt securities trading account assets and assets heldforsale deterioration in the financial condition of our consumer and commercial borrowers counterparties or underlying collateral could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our credit portfolios may be impacted by us and global macroeconomic and market conditions events and disruptions including declines in gdp consumer spending or property values asset price corrections increasing consumer and corporate leverage increases in corporate bond spreads government shutdowns tax changes rising or elevated unemployment levels inflation fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest rates as well as the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change including acute andor chronic extreme weather events and efforts to transition to a lowcarbon economy significant economic or market stresses and disruptions typically have a negative impact on the business environment and financial markets which could impact the underlying credit quality of our borrowers counterparties and assets property value declines or asset price corrections could increase the risk of borrowers or counterparties defaulting or becoming delinquent in their obligations to us and could decrease the value of the collateral we hold which could increase credit losses credit risk could also be magnified by lending to leveraged borrowers or declining asset prices including property or collateral values unrelated to macroeconomic stress simultaneous drawdowns on lines of credit andor an increase in a borrowers leverage in a weakening economic environment or otherwise could result in deterioration in our credit portfolio should borrowers be unable to fulfill competing financial obligations increased delinquency and default rates could adversely affect our credit portfolios including consumer credit card home equity and residential mortgage portfolios through increased chargeoffs and provisions for credit losses a recessionary environment andor a rise in unemployment could adversely impact the ability of our consumer andor commercial borrowers or counterparties to meet their financial obligations and negatively impact our credit portfolio consumers have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by inflation resulting in drawdowns of savings or increases in household debt higher interest rates which have increased debt servicing costs for some businesses and households may adversely impact credit quality particularly in a recessionary environment certain sectors also remain at risk eg commercial real estate office exposure consumer discretionary industries as a result of shifts in demand from the pandemic globally conditions of slow growth or recession could further contribute to weaker credit conditions if the macroeconomic environment worsens our credit portfolio and allowance for credit losses could be adversely impacted we establish an allowance for credit losses which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments based on managements best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses ecl inherent in our relevant financial assets the process to determine the allowance for credit losses uses models and assumptions that require us to make difficult and complex judgments that are often interrelated including forecasting how borrowers or counterparties may perform in changing economic conditions the ability of our borrowers or counterparties to repay their obligations may be impacted by changes in future economic conditions which in turn could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates there is also the possibility that we have failed or will fail to accurately identify the appropriate economic indicators or accurately estimate their impacts to our borrowers or counterparties which could impact the accuracy of our loss forecasts and allowance estimates if the models estimates and assumptions we use to establish reserves or the judgments we make in extending credit to our borrowers or counterparties which are more sensitive table start bank of america table end due to the current uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment prove inaccurate in predicting future events we may suffer losses in excess of our ecl in addition changes to external factors can negatively impact our recognition of credit losses in our portfolios and allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is our best estimate of ecl however there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to address credit losses particularly if the economic outlook deteriorates significantly and quickly or unexpectedly as circumstances change we may increase our allowance which would reduce our earnings if economic conditions worsen impacting our consumer and commercial borrowers counterparties or underlying collateral and credit losses are worse than expected we may increase our provision for credit losses which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our concentrations of credit risk could adversely affect our credit losses results of operations and financial condition we may be subject to concentrations of credit risk because of a common characteristic or common sensitivity to economic financial public health or business developments concentrations of credit risk may reside in a particular industry geography product asset class counterparty or within any pool of exposures with a common risk characteristic a deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry geographic location product or asset class or a failure or downgrade of or default by any particular entity or group of entities could negatively affect our businesses and it is possible our limits and credit monitoring exposure controls will not function as anticipated we execute a high volume of transactions and have significant credit concentrations with respect to the financial services industry predominantly comprised of brokerdealers commercial banks investment banks insurance companies mutual funds hedge funds ccps and other institutional clients financial services institutions and other counterparties are interrelated because of trading funding clearing or other relationships defaults by one or more counterparties or market uncertainty about the financial stability of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally could lead to marketwide liquidity disruptions losses defaults and related disputes and litigation our credit risk may also be heightened by market risk when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due to us which may occur as a result of events that impact the value of the collateral such as an asset price correction or fraud disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress volatility or illiquidity and we could suffer losses during such periods if we are unable to realize the fair value of the collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral we have concentrations of credit risk with respect to our consumer real estate and consumer credit card and our commercial real estate and asset managers and funds portfolios which represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio declining home price valuations and demand where we have large concentrations could result in increased servicing advances and expenses defaults delinquencies or credit losses the impacts of earthquakes as well as climate change such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters including droughts floods wildfires and hurricanes could negatively impact collateral the valuations of home or commercial real estate or our customers ability andor willingness to pay fees outstanding loans or afford new products this could also cause insurability risk andor increased insurance costs to customers economic weaknesses sustained elevated inflation adverse business conditions market disruptions adverse economic or market events rising interest or capitalization rates declining asset prices greater volatility in areas where we have concentrated credit risk or deterioration in real estate values or household incomes may cause us to experience a decrease in cash flow and higher credit losses in our portfolios or cause us to write down the value of certain assets we could also experience continued and longterm negative impacts to our commercial credit exposure and an increase in credit losses within those industries that may be permanently impacted by a change in consumer preferences resulting from covid19 eg commercial real estate exposure or other industry disruptions we also enter into transactions with sovereign nations us states and municipalities unfavorable economic or political conditions such as those arising from the russiaukraine conflict disruptions to capital markets currency fluctuations changes in oil prices social instability and changes in government or monetary policies could adversely impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of these government entities and expose us to credit and liquidity risk liquidity disruptions in the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of our positions increasing concentrations which could increase rwa and the credit and market risk associated with our positions we may be adversely affected by weaknesses in the us housing market us home prices declined and housing demand slowed in the second half of including in certain markets where we have large concentrations of loans driven in part by higher mortgage rates including 30year fixedrate mortgages that more than doubled from this has negatively impacted the demand in some cases and underlying collateral for many of our products additionally our mortgage loan production volume is generally influenced by the rate of growth in residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the residential mortgage market both of which have slowed due to rising interest rates and reduced affordability a deeper downturn in the condition of the us housing market could result in both significant writedowns of asset values in several asset classes notably mortgagebacked securities mbs if the us housing market were to further weaken the value of real estate could decline which could result in increased credit losses and delinquent servicing expenses negatively affect our representations and warranties exposures and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected risks and potential losses we are party to a large number of derivatives transactions that may expose us to unexpected market credit and operational risks that could cause us to suffer unexpected losses severe declines in asset values or an unanticipated credit event including unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated and vice versa may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account or anticipated in the development structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument certain otc derivative contracts and other trading agreements provide that upon the occurrence of certain specified events such as a change to our or our affiliates credit ratings we may be required to provide additional collateral or take other table start bank of america table end remedial actions and we could experience increased difficulty obtaining funding or hedging risks in some cases our counterparties may have the right to terminate or otherwise diminish our rights under these contracts or agreements we are also a member of various ccps which potentially increases our credit risk exposures to those ccps in the event that one or more members of a ccp default on their obligations we may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the ccp as a result of that default a ccp may also at its discretion modify the margin we are required to post which could mean unexpected and increased funding costs and exposure to that ccp as a clearing member we are exposed to the risk of nonperformance by our clients for which we clear transactions which may not be covered by available collateral additionally default by a significant market participant may result in further risk and potential losses geopolitical we are subject to numerous political economic market reputational operational compliance legal regulatory and other risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate we do business throughout the world including in emerging markets economic or geopolitical stress in one or more countries could have a negative impact regionally or globally resulting in among other things market volatility reduced market value and economic output our liquidity and credit risk could be adversely impacted by and our businesses and revenues derived from nonus jurisdictions are subject to risk of loss from financial social or judicial instability economic sanctions changes in government leadership including as a result of electoral outcomes or otherwise changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization andor confiscation of assets price controls high inflation natural disasters the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics capital controls currency redenomination risk from a country exiting the eu or otherwise currency fluctuations foreign exchange controls or movements caused by devaluation or depegging unfavorable political and diplomatic developments oil price fluctuations and changes in legislation these risks are especially elevated in emerging markets continued tensions between the us and important trading partners particularly china may result in sanctions further tariff increases or other restrictive actions on crossborder trade investment and transfer of information technology that weigh on trade volumes raise costs for producers and adversely affect our businesses and revenues as well as our customers and counterparties including their credit quality slowing growth recessionary conditions market volatility andor political or civil unrest global supply chain disruptions labor shortages wage pressures and elevated inflation in many countries pose additional challenges including in the form of volatility in financial markets foreign exchange rates against the us dollar remain an area of uncertainty and potential volatility as the federal reserve and other central banks raise interest rates and depreciation could increase our financial risks with clients that deal in nonus currencies but have us dollardenominated debt we invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in nonus jurisdictions including emerging markets revenues from the trading of nonus securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors furthermore the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because nonus trading markets particularly in emerging markets are generally smaller less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets risks in one nation can limit our opportunities for portfolio growth and negatively affect our operations in other nations including our us operations market and economic disruptions may affect consumer confidence levels and spending corporate investment and job creation bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer and corporate debt economic growth rates and asset values among other factors elevated government debt levels raise the risk of volatility significant valuation changes political tensions among eu members regarding fiscal policy or defaults on or devaluation of sovereign debt which could expose us to substantial losses financial markets have been and may continue to be sensitive to government plans to lower taxes or increase spending our nonus businesses are also subject to extensive regulation by governments securities exchanges and regulators central banks and other regulatory bodies in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services and securities industries are less predictable prone to change and uncertainty and evolving and it may be difficult to determine the requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions significant resources are spent on understanding and monitoring foreign laws rules and regulations our inability to remain in compliance with local laws and manage our relationships with regulators could result in increased expenses changes to our organizational structure and adversely affect our businesses reputation and results of operations in that market we are also subject to complex and extensive us and nonus laws rules and regulations which subject us to costs and risks relating to bribery and corruption antimoney laundering embargo programs and economic sanctions which can vary by jurisdiction and require implementation of complex operational capabilities and compliance programs noncompliance andor violations could result in an increase in operational and compliance costs and enforcement actions and civil and criminal penalties against us and individual employees the increasing speed and novel ways in which funds circulate could make it more challenging to track the movement of funds and heighten financial crimes risk compliance with these evolving regulatory regimes and legal requirements depends on our ability to improve our processes controls surveillance detection and reporting and analytic capabilities in connection with the uks exit from the eu we are now subject to different laws and regulations which are expected to diverge further over time and are subject to the oversight of additional regulatory authorities as political and regulatory environments evolve further changes to the legal and regulatory framework under which our subsidiaries provide products and services in the uk and in the eu may result in additional compliance costs and have negative tax consequences or an adverse impact on our results of operations in the us the governments debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of us government defaults on its debt andor downgrades to its credit ratings and prolonged government shutdowns which could weaken the us dollar cause market volatility negatively impact the global economy and banking system and adversely affect our financial condition including our liquidity additionally changes in fiscal monetary or regulatory policy including as a result of labor shortages wage pressures supply chain disruptions and higher inflation could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business operations organizational structure and results of operations monetary policy has contributed to a significant depreciation of many foreign currencies over the past table start bank of america table end year emerging markets are particularly vulnerable to tighter us monetary policy and many have responded by tightening monetary policy and intervening in foreign exchange markets further monetary tightening by the federal reserve risks creating additional currency volatility and recessionary conditions in a number of nonus markets we are also subject to geopolitical risks including economic sanctions acts or threats of international or domestic terrorism including responses by the us or other governments thereto increased risk of statesponsored cyberattacks or campaigns civil unrest andor military conflicts including the escalation of tensions between china and taiwan which could adversely affect business market trade and general economic conditions abroad and in the us the russiaukraine conflict has magnified such risks and resulted in regional instability and adversely impacted commodity and other financial markets as well as economic conditions especially in europe where there is significant risk of recession in some countries the disruption of energy supplies and other goods and sanctions have contributed to inflationary pressures in europe and other regions which has resulted in greater monetary tightening by policymakers and could adversely impact the profitability of businesses and our credit risk military escalation resulting in the involvement of neighboring countries andor north atlantic treaty organization member countries or new sanctions could result in additional economic disruptions financial market volatility and changes to asset valuations which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations business operations a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties or the financial services industry could cause disruptions adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and cause legal or reputational harm operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and as a result of our interactions with and reliance on third parties and the financial services industry infrastructure our operational and security systems infrastructure including our computer systems emerging technologies data management and internal processes and controls as well as those of third parties are integral to our performance our financial accounting data processing and transmission storage backup and other operating or security systems and infrastructure or those of third parties may be ineffective or fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our or such third partys control which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services prolonged disruptions to our critical business operations and customer services are possible due to computer telecommunications network utility electronic or physical infrastructure outages including from abuse or failure of our electronic trading and algorithmic platforms significant unplanned increases in customer transactions newly identified vulnerabilities in key hardware and software failure of aging infrastructure or manual processes retired or redundant software andor hardware technology project implementation challenges and supply chain disruptions operational disruptions and prolonged operational outages could also result from events arising from natural disasters including acute and chronic weather events such as wildfires tornadoes hurricanes and floods some of which are happening with more frequency and severity and earthquakes as well as local or larger scale political or social matters including civil unrest terrorist acts and military conflict we continue to have greater reliance on remote access tools and technology and employees personal systems and our third parties employees personal systems and increased data utilization and are increasingly dependent upon our information technology infrastructure to operate our businesses remotely due to the increased number of employees who work from

organization and expose us to operational losses regulatory risk and reputational harm our and our third parties inability to properly introduce deploy and manage changes to internal financial and governance processes existing products services and technology and new product innovations and technology could also result in additional operational and regulatory risk regardless of the measures we have taken to implement training procedures backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations and bolster our operational resilience our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely including systemic cyber events that result in system outages and unavailability of part or all of the internet cloud services andor the financial services industry infrastructure including electronic trading platforms and critical banking activities our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is more limited than with our own systems any backup systems may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been backed up we regularly update the systems we rely on to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws rules and regulations globally this updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones including business interruptions a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure resulting in disruption to our critical business operations and customer services andor failure to identify effectively respond to operational risks in a timely manner and continue to deliver our services through an operational disruption could expose us to a number of risks including market abuse regulatory market

heightened because of among other things our prominent size and scale highprofile brand geographic footprint and international presence and role in the financial services industry and the broader economy the proliferation of thirdparty financial data aggregators and emerging technologies including our use of automation artificial intelligence ai and robotics increase our cybersecurity risks and exposure we our employees customers regulators and third parties are regularly the target of an increasing number of cyber threats and attacks cyber threats and techniques used in cyberattacks are pervasive sophisticated and difficult to prevent including computer viruses malicious or destructive code such as ransomware social engineering including phishing vishing and smishing denial of

and implement controls processes policies employee training and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate or detect cyberattacks or information or security breaches andor develop or implement effective preventive or defensive measures to address or mitigate such attacks or breaches internal access management failures could result in the compromise or unauthorized exposure of confidential data additionally the failure of our employees to exercise sound judgment and vigilance when targeted with social engineering cyberattacks may increase our vulnerability our risk and exposure to cyberattacks and security breaches continue to increase due to the acceptance and use of digital banking products and services including mobile banking products and reliance on remote access tools and technology which have increased our reliance on virtualdigital interactions and a larger number of access points to our networks that must be secured this increased risk of unauthorized access to our networks results in greater amounts of information being available for access employees working remotely away from the office whether on personal or our devices also represent inherently greater risk than employees working in our offices greater demand on our information technology infrastructure and security tools and processes will likely continue we also face indirect technology cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers clients and other third parties with whom we do business and the financial services industry upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities or upon whom our customers rely other indirect risks relate to providers of products andor services financial counterparties financial data aggregators financial intermediaries such as clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses regulators providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power and retailers for whom we process transactions we are also at additional risk resulting from critical thirdparty information security and opensource software vulnerabilities we have exposure to cyber threats due to our continuous transmission of sensitive information to and storage of such information by third parties including providers of products andor services and regulators the outsourcing of some of our business operations and system and customer account updates and conversions further any such event may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner any failure cyberattack or other information or

brought by third parties litigation exposure regulatory sanctions enforcement actions government fines penalties or intervention and other negative consequences the actual or perceived success of a cyberattack on our systems may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business andor result in the loss of confidence in our security measures additionally our failure

assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate cyberattacks or other information or security breaches could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and our internal controls or disclosure controls being rendered

service mortgage loans on behalf of thirdparty securitization vehicles and other investors if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer or master servicer we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice which could cause us to lose servicing income we may also have liability for any failure by us as a servicer or master servicer for any act or omission on our part that involves willful misfeasance bad faith gross negligence or reckless disregard of our duties if any such breach was found to have occurred it may harm our reputation increase our servicing costs or losses due to potential indemnification obligations result in litigation or regulatory action or adversely impact our results of operations additionally foreclosures may result in costs litigation or losses due to irregularities in the underlying documentation or if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or overturned by a court because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process we may also incur costs or losses relating to delays or alleged deficiencies in processing documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosure changes in the structure of and relationship among the gses could adversely impact our business we rely on the gses to guarantee or purchase mortgage loans that meet their conforming loan requirements during we sold approximately billion of loans to gses primarily freddie mac fhlmc fhlmc and fannie mae fnma are currently in conservatorship with the federal housing finance agency fhfa acting as conservator in the treasury department published a proposal to recapitalize fhlmc and fnma and remove them from conservatorship and reduce their role in the marketplace in january the treasury department further amended the agreement that governs the conservatorship of fhlmc and fnma and delineated the continued objective to remove the gses from conservatorship however we cannot predict the future prospects of the gses timing of the recapitalization or release from conservatorship or content of legislative or rulemaking proposals regarding the future status of the gses in the housing market if the gses take a reduced role in the marketplace including by limiting the mortgage products they offer we could be required to seek alternative funding sources retain additional loans on our balance sheet secure funding through the federal home loan bank system or securitize the loans through private label securitization which could increase our cost of funds related to the origination of new mortgage loans increase credit risk andor impact our capacity to originate new mortgage loans uncertainty regarding their future and the mbs they guarantee continues to exist for the foreseeable future these developments could adversely affect our securities portfolios capital levels liquidity and results of operations our risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us we seek to effectively and consistently identify measure monitor report and control the key types of risk to which we are subject including strategic credit market liquidity compliance operational and reputational risks additionally risks may span across multiple key risk types including climate risk and legal risk while we employ a broad and diversified set of controls and risk mitigation techniques including modeling and forecasting hedging strategies and techniques that seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses our ability to control and mitigate risks that result in losses is inherently limited by our ability to identify and measure all risks including emerging and unknown risks anticipate the timing and impact of risks apply effective hedging strategies make correct assumptions manage and aggregate data correctly and efficiently identify changes in markets or client behaviors not yet inherent in historical data and develop risk management models and forecasts to assess and control risk our ability to manage risk is dependent on our ability to consistently execute all elements of our risk management program and develop and maintain a culture of managing risk well throughout the corporation and manage risks associated with third parties including providers of products andor services enable effective risk management and help confirm that risks are appropriately considered evaluated and responded to in a timely manner uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of and change within the financial services industry the pace of technological changes accounting and market developments the failure of employees representatives and third parties to comply with our policies and risk framework and the overall complexity of our operations among other developments have in the past and may in the future result in a heightened level of risk for example we have experienced increased operational reputational and compliance risk as a result of the prior need to rapidly deploy and implement multiple and varying pandemic relief programs including the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states which have resulted in and will continue to result in losses our failure to manage evolving risks or properly anticipate manage control or mitigate risks could result in additional losses table start bank of america table end regulatory compliance and legal we are subject to evolving government legislation and regulations and certain settlements orders and agreements with government authorities from time to time we are subject to evolving and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the us and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate including increasing and complex regulatory sanctions regimes these laws and regulations significantly affect and have the potential to restrict the scope of our existing businesses limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities including the products and services we offer reduce certain fees and rates or make our products and services more expensive for our clients we are also required to file various financial and nonfinancial regulatory reports to comply with laws rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate we continue to adjust our business and operations legal entity structure disclosure and policies processes procedures and controls including with regard to capital and liquidity management risk management and data management to comply with laws rules and regulations as well as guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities including the department of treasury including the internal revenue service irs federal reserve occ cfpb financial stability oversight council fdic department of labor sec and cftc in the us foreign regulators other government authorities and selfregulatory organizations further we could become subject to future laws rules and regulations beyond those currently proposed adopted or contemplated in the us or abroad including policies and rulemaking related to emerging technologies cybersecurity and data and climate risk management and esg governance and reporting including emissions and sustainability disclosure the cumulative effect of all of the current and possible future legislation and regulations on our litigation and regulatory exposure businesses operations and profitability remains uncertain and necessitates that we make certain assumptions with respect to the scope and requirements of prospective and proposed laws rules and regulations in our business planning if these assumptions prove incorrect we could be subject to increased regulatory legal and compliance risks and costs as well as potential reputational harm also us and regulatory initiatives abroad may overlap and nonus regulation and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed us regulations which could lead to compliance risks and increased costs our regulators prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct our actions and they have assumed an active oversight inspection and investigatory role across the financial services industry regulatory focus is not limited to laws rules and regulations applicable to the financial services industry but includes other significant laws rules and regulations that apply across industries and jurisdictions including those related to antimoney laundering antibribery anticorruption and regulatory sanctions we are also subject to laws rules and regulations in the us and abroad including the gdpr and ccpa as modified by the cpra and a number of additional jurisdictions enacting or considering similar laws regarding privacy and the disclosure collection use sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information including our employees customers suppliers counterparties and other third parties the violation of which could result in litigation regulatory fines enforcement actions and operational loss the complexity and risk of compliance has been magnified by the collection of employee health andor other information in response to the pandemic additionally we will likely be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the us and abroad which could result in additional costs of compliance litigation regulatory fines and enforcement actions there remains complexity and uncertainty including potential suspension or prohibition regarding data transfer because of concerns over compliance with laws rules and regulations for crossborder flows and transfers of personal data from the european economic area eea to the us and other jurisdictions outside of the eea resulting from judicial and regulatory guidance to the extent that a new euus data privacy framework leads to a relaxation of applicable legislation and regulations regardless of transfer mechanism challenges are expected from consumer advocacy groups other jurisdictions including china russia and india have commenced consultation efforts or enacted new legislation or regulations to establish standards for personal data transfers if crossborder personal data transfers are suspended or restricted or we are required to implement distinct processes for each jurisdictions standards this could result in operational disruptions to our businesses additional costs increased enforcement activity new contract negotiations with third parties andor modification of such data management as part of their enforcement authority our regulators and other government authorities have the authority to among other things conduct investigations and assess significant civil or criminal monetary fines penalties or restitution issue cease and desist orders initiate injunctive action apply regulatory sanctions or enter into consent orders the amounts paid by us and other financial institutions to settle proceedings or investigations have in some instances been substantial and may increase in some cases governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such resolutions which could have significant consequences including reputational harm loss of customers restrictions on the ability to access capital markets and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products our response to regulators and other government authorities may be timeconsuming be expensive and divert management attention from our business the outcome of any matter which may last years may be difficult to predict or estimate additionally the terms of settlements orders and agreements that we have entered into with government entities and regulatory authorities have imposed or could impose significant operational and compliance costs on us with respect to enhancements to our procedures and controls losses with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against our customers expansion of our risk and control functions within our lines of business investment in technology and the hiring of significant numbers of additional risk control and compliance personnel if we fail to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements orders or agreements to which we are subject or more generally fail to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by our regulators and other government authorities we could be required to enter into further settlements orders or agreements and pay additional fines penalties or judgments or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses improper actions behaviors or practices by us our employees or representatives that are illegal unethical or contrary to our core values could harm us our shareholders or customers or damage the integrity of the financial markets and are subject to regulatory scrutiny across jurisdictions the complexity of the regulatory and enforcement regimes in the table start bank of america table end us coupled with the global scope of our operations and the regulatory environment worldwide also means that a single event or practice or a series of related events or practices may give rise to a significant number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings either by multiple federal and state agencies in the us or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions actions by other members of the financial services industry related to business activities in which we participate may result in investigations by regulators or other government authorities while we believe that we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs compliance risks will continue to exist particularly as we anticipate and adapt to new and evolving laws rules and regulations we also rely upon third parties who may expose us to compliance and legal risk future legislative or regulatory actions and any required changes to our business or operations or those of third parties upon whom we rely resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue impose additional compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce our profitability limit the products and services that we offer or our ability to pursue certain business opportunities require us to dispose of certain businesses or assets require us to curtail certain businesses affect the value of assets that we hold require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products or otherwise adversely affect our businesses we are subject to risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits and regulatory and government action we face significant legal risks in our business with a high volume of claims against us and other financial institutions the amount of damages penalties and fines that litigants and regulators seek from us and other financial institutions continues to be significant this includes disputes with consumers customers and other counterparties financial institutions including us continue to be the subject of claims alleging anticompetitive conduct with respect to various products and markets including us antitrust class actions claiming joint and several liability for treble damages as disclosed in note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements we also face contractual indemnification and loanrepurchase claims arising from alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the sale of residential mortgages by legacy companies which may result in a requirement that we repurchase the mortgage loans or make whole or provide other remedies to counterparties us regulators and government agencies regularly pursue enforcement claims against financial institutions including the corporation for alleged violations of law and customer harm under the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act the federal securities laws the false claims act fair lending laws and regulations including the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act antitrust laws and consumer protection laws and regulations related to products and services such as overdraft and sales practices including prohibitions on unfair deceptive andor abusive acts and practices under the consumer financial protection act and the federal trade commission act such claims may carry significant penalties restitution and in certain cases treble damages and the ultimate resolution of regulatory inquiries investigations and other proceedings to which we are subject from timetotime is difficult to predict t here is also an increased focus on compliance with us and global laws rules and regulations related to the collection use sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information and corporate data as well as the implementation use and management of emerging technologies including ai and machine learning additionally misconduct by our employees and representatives including unethical fraudulent improper or illegal conduct unfair deceptive abusive or discriminatory business practices or violations of policies procedures laws rules or regulations including conduct that affects compliance with books and records requirements can result in litigation andor government investigations and enforcement actions and cause significant reputational harm we are also subject to litigation and regulatory and government actions regarding fraud perpetrated against our customers in connection with the use of our products and services and increased scrutiny of sustainabilityrelated policies goals targets and disclosure which could result in litigation regulatory investigations and actions and reputational harm the global environment of extensive investigations regulation regulatory compliance burdens litigation and regulatory enforcement combined with uncertainty related to the continually evolving regulatory environment have affected and will likely continue to affect operational and compliance costs and risks including the limitation or cessation of our ability or feasibility to continue providing certain products and services lawsuits and regulatory actions have resulted in and will likely continue to result in judgments orders settlements penalties and fines adverse to us further we entered into orders with government authorities regarding our participation in implementing government relief measures related to the pandemic and other federal and state government assistance programs including the processing of unemployment benefits for california and certain other states and continue to be involved in related litigation which may result in judgments andor settlements litigation and investigation costs substantial legal liability or significant regulatory or government action against us could have material adverse effects on our business financial condition including liquidity and results of operations andor cause significant reputational harm us federal banking agencies may require us to increase our regulatory capital total lossabsorbing capacity tlac longterm debt or liquidity requirements we are subject to us regulatory capital and liquidity rules these rules among other things establish minimum requirements to qualify as a wellcapitalized institution if any of our subsidiary insured depository institutions fail to maintain their status as well capitalized under the applicable regulatory capital rules the federal reserve will require us to agree to bring the insured depository institution back to wellcapitalized status for the duration of such an agreement the federal reserve may impose restrictions on our activities if we were to fail to enter into or comply with such an agreement the federal reserve may impose more severe restrictions on our activities including requiring us to cease and desist activities permitted under the bank holding company act of capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended it is possible that regulators may increase regulatory capital requirements including tlac and longterm debt requirements change how regulatory capital or rwa is calculated or increase liquidity requirements our ability to return capital to our shareholders depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers to the extent that increases occur in our scb gsib surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer our returns of capital to shareholders including common stock dividends and common stock repurchases could decrease for example our gsib surcharge is expected to increase by bps to percent on january the federal reserve could table start bank of america table end also limit or prohibit capital actions such as paying or increasing dividends or repurchasing common stock as a result of economic disruptions or events as part of its ccar the federal reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the federal reserve those scenarios may affect our ccar stress test results which may impact the level of our scb requiring us to hold additional capital for example based on ccar stress test results our scb increased bps to percent on october a significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our rwa and our leverage exposure which may increase the basel committee on banking supervision has also revised several key methodologies for measuring rwa that have not yet been implemented in the us including a standardized approach for operational risk revised market risk requirements and constraints on the use of internal models as well as a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches it is expected in that us banking regulators will propose updates to the us capital framework to incorporate the basel committee revisions economic disruptions or events may also cause an increase in our balance sheet rwa or leverage exposures increasing required regulatory capital and liquidity amounts changes to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets increase borrowings issue additional equity or other securities reduce the amount of common stock repurchases or dividends cease or alter certain operations and business activities or hold highly liquid assets which may adversely affect our results of operations changes in accounting standards or assumptions in applying accounting policies could adversely affect us accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and results of operations and are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain if assumptions estimates or judgments were erroneously applied we could be required to correct and restate priorperiod financial statements accounting standardsetters and those who interpret the accounting standards including the sec banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm may also amend or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how various standards should be applied these changes may be difficult to predict and could impact the preparation and reporting of our financial statements including the application of new or revised standards retrospectively resulting in revisions to priorperiod financial statements we may be adversely affected by changes in us and nonus tax laws and regulations it is possible that governmental authorities in the us andor other countries could further change tax laws in a way that would materially adversely affect us including changes to the tax cuts and jobs act of and inflation reduction act of new guidelines issued by the organization for economic cooperation and development could adversely impact how the global profits of multinational enterprises are taxed any change in tax laws and regulations or interpretations of current or future tax laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate tax liabilities and results of operations us and foreign tax laws are complex and our judgments interpretations or applications of such tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental authority this could result in additional tax liabilities and interest penalties the reduction of certain tax benefits andor the requirement to make adjustments to amounts recorded which could be material additionally we have uk net deferred tax assets dta which consist primarily of net operating losses that are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years adverse developments with respect to tax laws or to other material factors such as prolonged worsening of europes capital markets or changes in the ability of our uk subsidiaries to conduct business in the eu could lead our management to reassess andor change its current conclusion that no valuation allowance is necessary with respect to our uk net dta reputation damage to our reputation could harm our businesses including our competitive position and business prospects our ability to attract and retain customers clients investors and employees is impacted by our reputation harm to our reputation can arise from various sources including actual or perceived activities of our officers directors employees contractors third parties clients counterparties and other representatives such as fraud misconduct and unethical behavior such as employees sales practices adequacy of our responsiveness to fraud claims perpetrated against our customers effectiveness of our internal controls litigation or regulatory matters and their outcomes compensation practices lending practices suitability or reasonableness of particular trading or investment strategies including the reliability of our research and models and prohibiting clients from engaging in certain transactions our reputation may also be harmed by actual or perceived failure to deliver the products and standards of service and quality expected by our customers clients and the community including the overstatement or mislabeling of the environmental benefits of our products services or

various jurisdictions in a manner inconsistent with our current or future practices or with one another if personal confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession or in the possession of third parties or financial data aggregators is mishandled misused or mismanaged or if we do not timely or adequately address such information we may face regulatory legal and operational risks which could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations we could suffer reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to use our products and services or result in litigation or enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues such as operational risks gives rise to reputational risk that could harm us and our business prospects failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions legal risks and reputational harm which could among other consequences increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses other the impacts of the pandemic have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect us the covid19 pandemic has directly and indirectly negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains adversely affected equity market valuations created significant volatility and disruption in financial and capital markets resulted in challenging labor market conditions and adversely impacted our financial results to varying degrees and in various respects the future direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on global health and economic conditions and activity remain uncertain continue to evolve by region country and state and depend on future developments that cannot be predicted including impacts from the expiration of the federal covid19 public health emergency surges of covid19 cases and the spread of more dangerous variants of covid19 the availability usage and acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines changing client preferences and behavior and future public response and government actions including travel bans and restrictions and limitations on business such evolving impacts of the pandemic could disrupt the us and global economy including changes in financial and capital markets and adversely affect our businesses and operations liquidity results of operations and financial condition including from increased allowance for credit losses and noninterest expenses which are dependent on the pandemics duration and severity reforms to and replacement of ibors and certain other rates or indices may adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations though significant progress has been made in the global financial markets to replace products and contracts referencing london interbank offered rate libor or other ibors ibor products the aggregate notional amount of these ibor products remains material to our business risks and challenges associated with the transition from ibors remain and may result in consequences that cannot be fully anticipated which expose us to various financial operational supervisory conduct and legal risk while there has been significant progress in market and client adoption of arrs usage of arrs may vary across or within categories of contracts products and services potentially resulting in market fragmentation decreased trading volumes and liquidity increased complexity and modeling and operational risks arrs have compositions and characteristics that differ from the benchmarks they replace in some cases they have limited liquidity and may demonstrate less predictable performance over time than the benchmarks they replace for example certain arrs are calculated on a compounded or weightedaverage basis and unlike ibors do not reflect bank credit risk and therefore typically require a spread adjustment there are important differences between the fallbacks triggers and calculation methodologies being implemented in cash and derivatives markets any mismatch between the adoption of arrs in loans securities and derivatives markets may impact hedging or other financial arrangements we have implemented and we may experience unanticipated market exposures changes resulting from transition to successor or alternative rates may adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us amounts paid on securities we have issued amounts received and paid on derivatives we have entered into the value of such loans securities or derivative instruments the trading market for such products and contracts and our ability to effectively use hedging instruments to manage risk there can be no assurance that existing assets and liabilities based on or linked to ibors that have not already transitioned to arrs will transition without delay or potential disputes although a significant majority of the aggregate notional amount of our remaining ibor products maturing after include or have been amended to include fallbacks to arrs the transitioning of certain ibor products that do not include fallback provisions or adequate fallback mechanisms require additional efforts to modify their terms some outstanding ibor products are particularly challenging to modify due to the requirement that all impacted parties consent to such modification to address outstanding ibor products that are difficult to modify legislation has been adopted in the us and in other jurisdictions litigation disputes or other action may occur as a result of the interpretation or application of legislation or regulations including if there is an overlap between laws or regulations in different jurisdictions or from interactions with any fcacompelled synthetic libor settings some of our ibor products may contain language giving the calculation agent which may be us discretion to determine the successor rate including the applicable spread adjustment to the existing benchmark we may face a risk of litigation disputes or other actions from clients counterparties customers investors or others based on various claims for example that we incorrectly interpreted or enforced iborbased contract provisions failed to appropriately communicate the effect that the transition to arrs will have on existing and future products treated affected parties unfairly or made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients or engaged in anticompetitive behavior or unlawfully manipulated markets or benchmarks arrbased products that we develop launch andor support including products using credit sensitive rates may perform differently to ibor products during times of economic stress table start bank of america table end adverse or volatile market conditions and across the credit and economic cycle which may impact the value return on and profitability of our arrbased assets new financial products linked to arrs may have additional legal financial tax operational market compliance reputational competitive or other risks to us our clients and other market participants banking regulators in the us and globally have maintained heightened regulatory scrutiny and intensified supervisory focus on financial institution libor transition plans preparations and readiness including our use of creditsensitive rates like the bloomberg shortterm bank yield index and arrbased term rates which could result in regulatory action litigation andor the need to change the products offered by our businesses failure to meet industrywide ibor transition milestones and to cease issuance of ibor products by relevant cessation dates may subject to certain regulatory exceptions result in supervisory enforcement by applicable regulators increase our cost of and access to capital or lead to other consequences the ongoing market transition has altered and additional developments may further alter some aspects of our risk profile and risk management strategies including derivatives and hedging strategies modeling and analytics valuation tools product design and systems controls procedures and operational infrastructure further changes may increase costs and expose us to potential risks related to
