income tax expense effective tax rate changes in the effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended september compared to the same periods a year ago were primarily driven by changes in our recurring preference benefits also included in the nine months ended september was the impact of the uk tax law change further discussed in this section the majority of our recurring tax preference benefits consists of tax credits from esg investments in affordable housing where the recurring tax credits are recognized ratably over a term of up to years and wind and solar energy investments where the tax credits are recognized either at inception for transactions electing investment tax credits itcs or as energy is produced if electing production tax credits ptcs as further discussed below absent esg tax credits and unusual items the effective tax rates would have been approximately percent on august the us enacted the inflation reduction act of which contained a number of taxrelated provisions including the extension and expansion of renewable energy tax credit programs in particular partnerships are no longer limited to an itc but can now elect a ptc for solar energy production facilities placed in service after december as a result the corporation changed its estimated impact of solarrelated tax credits and reversed the impact of certain solar investment tax credits recognized in the first half of which increased income tax expense by million in the third quarter of if there is a change in the expected tax credit election an income tax adjustment will be recognized in the quarter in which the change occurs other notable tax law changes include the establishment of a new percent alternative minimum tax amt on adjusted financial statement income for large corporations and a one percent excise tax on net stock repurchases both of which are effective for tax years beginning on or after january the tax law changes for the new amt permit business credits including those from esg investments in renewable energy and affordable housing to offset potential amt liability the corporation has assessed the potential impacts of these two us tax law changes and does not expect the changes will have a significant effect on its future effective tax rate on june the uk enacted the finance act which increased the uk corporation income tax rate to percent from percent this change is effective april and unfavorably affects income tax expense on future uk earnings as a result during the three months ended june the corporation recorded a positive income tax adjustment of approximately billion with a corresponding writeup of uk net deferred tax assets which reflected a reversal of previously recorded writedowns of net deferred tax assets for

these nongaap financial measures are not intended as a substitute for gaap financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as nongaap financial measures used by other companies we view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an fte basis which when presented on a consolidated basis are nongaap financial measures to derive the fte basis net interest income is adjusted to reflect taxexempt income on an equivalent beforetax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense for purposes of this calculation we use the federal statutory tax rate of percent and a representative state tax rate net interest yield which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds utilizes net interest income on an fte basis we believe that presentation of these items on an fte basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and taxexempt sources and is consistent with industry practices we may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items eg debit valuation adjustment dva gains losses which result in nongaap financial measures we believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful

market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations primarily within our global markets segment we are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the corporation eg our alm activities in the event of market stress these risks could have a material impact on our results trading risk management to evaluate risks in our trading activities we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions var is a common statistic used to measure market risk our primary var statistic is equivalent to a percent confidence level which means that for a var with a oneday holding period there should not be losses in excess of var on average out of trading days table presents the total marketbased portfolio var which is the combination of the

income over the next months from september and december resulting from instantaneous parallel and nonparallel shocks to the marketbased forward curve periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment the interest rate scenarios also assume us dollar interest rates are floored at zero depending on the level of interest rates downrate scenarios may not receive the full impact of the rate shock particularly in low rate environments during the nine months ended september the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to uprate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in longend and shortend rates we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated oci and thus capital levels under the basel capital rules under instantaneous upward parallel shifts the nearterm adverse impact to basel capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities for more information on basel see capital management regulatory capital on page table estimated banking book net

instantaneous change longend instantaneous change nm steepeners shortend instantaneous change nm longend instantaneous change nm not meaningful the sensitivity analysis in table assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates as part of our alm activities we use securities certain residential mortgages and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity the behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the sensitivity analysis in table assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts we use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our alm activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks specifically we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks our interest rate derivative contracts are generally nonleveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps options futures and forwards and our foreign exchange contracts include crosscurrency interest rate swaps foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency forward contracts and options the derivatives used in our alm activities can be split into two broad categories designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the interest rate risk management for the banking book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in table the corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations by hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations the corporations market risk exposure in this area is not significant risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the corporations nontrading foreign currencydenominated financial instruments these foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as crosscurrency basis spreads and interest rate risk however as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives the market risk related to this exposure is not significant for more information on the accounting for derivatives see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements mortgage

and market changes and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods as well as chronic longerterm shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels these changes and events can have broad impacts on operations supply chains distribution networks customers and markets and are otherwise referred to respectively as transition risk and physical risk these risks can impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types the impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk or market risk by reducing our customers operating income or the value of their assets as well as expose us to reputational andor litigation risk due to increased regulatory scrutiny or negative public sentiment physical risk can lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral in addition it could pose increased operational risk to our facilities and people in we publicly announced our commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our financing activities operations and supply chain before net zero goal and set emissions targets for our operations and supply chain in connection with our net zero goal we committed to reduce emissions by associated with our financing activities related to auto manufacturing energy and power generation targets in our september task force on climaterelated financial disclosures report we disclosed our and financed emissions and emissions intensity metrics for these sectors with serving as the baseline for our targets in line with our participation in the net zero banking alliance we plan to disclose the financed emissions for additional portions of our business loan portfolio in and we expect to set financing activity emission reduction targets for other key sectors by april these reduction targets are intended to align with the international energy agency net zero emissions global pathway to limit warming to degrees celsius achieving our climaterelated goals and targets including our net zero goal and targets will require technological advances clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors public policies including those that improve the cost of capital for net zero transition and better emissions data reporting as well as ongoing strong and active engagement with customers suppliers investors government officials and other stakeholders given the extended period of these and other climaterelated goals we have established our initiatives have not resulted in a
