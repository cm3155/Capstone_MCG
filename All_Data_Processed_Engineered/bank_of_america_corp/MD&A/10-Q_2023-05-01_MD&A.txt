to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions to achieve that objective we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base and seek to align liquidityrelated incentives and risks these liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market stress from increased volatility due to the failure of certain financial institutions in march for more information see executive summary recent developments financial market events on page our practices have also allowed us to effectively manage market fluctuations from the rising interest rate environment inflationary pressures and changes in the macroeconomic environment we define liquidity as readily available assets limited to cash and highquality liquid unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise we manage our liquidity position through lineofbusiness and alm activities as well as through our legal entity funding strategy on both a forward and current including intraday basis under both expected and stressed conditions we believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor bank of america liquidity requirements maximizes

typically issued to meet client demand and notes with certain bank of america attributes may also be tlac eligible we typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives andor investments in the underlying instruments so that from a funding perspective the cost is similar to our other unsecured longterm debt we could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances which we consider for liquidity planning purposes we believe however that a portion of such

report on form 10k table presents the spot and 12month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at march and december table forward rates march federal funds sofr 10year swap spot rates 12month forward rates december federal funds threemonth libor 10year swap spot rates 12month forward rates the corporation uses sofr in its baseline forecast as one of the primary arrs used as a result of the planned cessation of libor in for more information on the transition from libor to arrs see executive summary recent developments libor and other benchmark rates on page table shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next months from march and december resulting from instantaneous parallel and nonparallel shocks to the marketbased forward curve periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment the interest rate scenarios also assume us dollar interest rates are floored at zero during the three months ended march the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to higher and lower rate scenarios was primarily due to changes in deposit product mix and risk management activities performed in our alm portfolio to respond to changing market conditions we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated oci and thus capital levels under the basel capital rules under instantaneous upward parallel shifts the nearterm adverse impact to basel capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities for more information on basel see capital management regulatory capital on page table estimated banking book net interest income sensitivity to curve changes short rate bps long rate bps dollars in millions march december parallel shifts bps instantaneous shift bps instantaneous shift flatteners shortend instantaneous change longend instantaneous change steepeners shortend instantaneous change longend instantaneous change the sensitivity analysis in table assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates as part of our alm activities we use securities certain residential mortgages and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity bank of america the behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the sensitivity analysis in table assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments in higher rate scenarios the increase in net interest income would be impacted by any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding as our benefit in those scenarios would be reduced conversely in lowerrate scenarios any customer activity that results in the replacement of higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding with lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits would reduce our exposure in those scenarios for interest rate scenarios larger than bps shifts it is expected that the interest rate sensitivity will illustrate nonlinear behaviors as there are numerous estimates and assumptions which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated that could impact the outcome pertaining to the mortgagebacked securities and residential mortgage portfolio if longend interest rates were to significantly decrease over the next twelve months for example over bps there would generally be an increase in customer prepayment behaviors with an incremental reduction to net interest income noting that the extent of changes in customer prepayment activity can be impacted by multiple factors and is not necessarily limited to longend interest rates conversely if longend interest rates were to significantly increase over the next twelve months for example over bps customer prepayments would likely modestly decrease and result in an incremental increase to net interest income in addition deposit pricing will have nonlinear impacts to larger shortend rate movements in decreasing interest rate scenarios and particularly where interest rates have decreased to small amounts the ability to further reduce rates paid is reduced as customer rates near zero in higher shortend rate scenarios deposit pricing will likely increase at a faster rate leading to incremental interest expense and reducing asset sensitivity while the impact related to the above assumptions used in the asset sensitivity analysis can provide directional analysis on how net interest income will be impacted in changing environments the ultimate impact is dependent upon the interrelationship of the assumptions and factors which vary in different macroeconomic scenarios interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts we use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our alm activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks specifically we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks our interest rate derivative contracts are generally nonleveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps options futures and forwards and our foreign exchange contracts include crosscurrency interest rate swaps foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency forward contracts and options the derivatives used in our alm activities can be split into two broad categories designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the interest rate risk management for the banking book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in table the corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations by hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations the corporations market risk exposure in this area is not significant risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the corporations nontrading foreign currencydenominated financial instruments these foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as crosscurrency basis spreads and interest rate risk however as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives the market risk related to this exposure is not significant for more information on the accounting for derivatives see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements mortgage banking risk management we originate fund and service mortgage loans which subject us to credit liquidity and interest rate risks among others we determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments irlcs and the related residential first mortgage loans heldforsale lhfs as well as the value of the msrs because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities for more information on irlcs and the related residential

climate risk management climaterelated risks are divided into two major categories risks related to the physical impacts of climate change driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods as well as chronic longerterm shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels and risks related to the transition to a lowcarbon economy which may entail extensive policy legal technology and market changes these changes and events may have broad impacts on operations supply chains distribution networks customers and markets and are otherwise referred to respectively as physical risk and transition risk these risks may impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types physical climate events may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or collateral value or increased operational risk by impacting the corporations facilities employees customers or vendors climaterelated transition changes in policy technology or the market may amplify credit risk through financial impacts to the corporation or its customers or counterparties or increase market risk including through sudden price adjustments in addition reputational risk may arise including from our climaterelated practices disclosures and commitments bank of america as climate risk spans all key risk types we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk framework and risk management programs established for each of our seven key types of risk we publicly announced our commitment to achieve net zero emissions in our financing activities operations and supply chain before net zero goal in connection with our net zero goal we set certain targets including reducing emissions associated with our operations and financing activities related to auto manufacturing energy and power generation and for our supply chain including that a certain proportion of our global suppliers set their own climate targets targets we disclosed our and financed emission and emission intensity metrics for the above referenced sectors in our task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd report with serving as the baseline for our financed emissions targets we plan to disclose the financed emissions for additional portions of our business loan portfolio in and we plan to set financing activity emission reduction targets for other key sectors by april achieving our climaterelated goals and targets including our net zero goal and targets may require technological advances clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors new standards and public policies including those that improve the cost of capital for the transition to a lowcarbon economy and better emissions data reporting as well as ongoing strong and active engagement with customers suppliers investors government officials and other stakeholders given the extended period of these and other climaterelated goals we have established our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position in the relevant periods presented herein for more information on our governance framework and
