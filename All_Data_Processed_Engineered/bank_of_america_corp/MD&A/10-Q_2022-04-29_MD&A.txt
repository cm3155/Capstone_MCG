rates used in our baseline forecasts at march and december table forward rates march federal funds threemonth libor 10year swap spot rates 12month forward rates december spot rates 12month forward rates table shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next months from march and december resulting from instantaneous parallel and nonparallel shocks to the marketbased forward curve periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment the interest rate scenarios also assume us dollar rates are floored at zero during the three months ended march the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to uprate and downrate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in longend rates we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and thus capital levels under the basel capital rules under instantaneous upward parallel shifts the nearterm adverse impact to basel capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities for more information on basel see capital management regulatory capital on page table estimated banking book net interest income sensitivity to curve changes short rate bps long rate bps dollars in millions march december parallel shifts bps instantaneous shift bps instantaneous shift flatteners shortend instantaneous change longend instantaneous change steepeners shortend instantaneous change longend instantaneous change the sensitivity analysis in table assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates as part of our alm activities we use securities certain residential mortgages and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity the behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the sensitivity analysis in table assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts we use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our alm activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks specifically we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks our interest rate derivative contracts are generally nonleveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps options futures and forwards and our foreign exchange contracts include crosscurrency interest rate swaps foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency forward contracts and options the derivatives used in our alm activities can be split into two broad categories designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the interest rate risk management for the banking book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in table the corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations by hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations the corporations market risk exposure in this area is insignificant risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the corporations nontrading foreign currencydenominated financial instruments these foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as crosscurrency basis spreads and interest rate risk however as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives the market risk related to this exposure is insignificant for more information on the accounting for derivatives see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements mortgage banking risk management we originate fund and service mortgage loans which subject us to credit liquidity and interest rate risks among others we determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments irlcs and the related residential first bank of america mortgage loans heldforsale lhfs as well as the value of the msrs because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities for more information on irlcs and the related residential mortgage lhfs see mortgage banking risk management in the mda of the corporations annual report on form 10k during the three months ended march and we recorded gains of million and million related to the change in fair value of msrs irlcs and lhfs net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio for more information on msrs see note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements climate risk management climaterelated risks are divided into two major categories risks related to the transition to a lowcarbon economy which may entail extensive policy legal technology and market changes and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods as well as chronic longerterm shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels these changes and events can have broad impacts on operations supply chains distribution networks customers and markets and are otherwise referred to respectively as transition risk and physical risk these risks can impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types the impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk or market risk by reducing our customers operating income or the value of their assets as well as expose us to reputational andor litigation risk due to increased regulatory scrutiny or negative public sentiment physical risk can lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral in addition it could pose increased operational risk to our facilities and people in we publicly announced our goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our financing activities operations and supply chain before net zero goal we also committed to set emission reduction targets for in connection with this commitment on april we published our first targets to reduce emissions by associated with our financing activities in the auto manufacturing energy and power generation sectors targets these reduction targets are intended to align with the goal to limit warming to degrees celsius we plan to disclose our financed emissions baseline for our auto manufacturing energy and power generation sectors along with data in our task force for climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd report that we expect to publish in the fall of we also plan to disclose the financed emissions for our entire business loan portfolio in achieving our net zero goal and targets will require technological advances clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors public policies including those that improve the cost of capital for net zero transition and better emissions data reporting as well as ongoing strong and active engagement with clients suppliers investors government officials and other stakeholders given the extended period of these and other climaterelated goals we have established our initiatives have not resulted in a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the relevant periods presented herein and are not expected to have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition in the nearterm for more information on our governance framework and climate risk management
