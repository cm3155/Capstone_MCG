risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders if not managed well risk can result in financial loss regulatory sanctions and penalties and damage to our reputation each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies we take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined risk framework and an articulated risk appetite statement which are approved annually by the erc and the board the seven key types of risk faced by the corporation are strategic credit market liquidity compliance operational and reputational strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors inappropriate business plans ineffective business strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings market risk is composed of price risk and interest rate risk liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the corporation arising from the failure of the corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems people or external events reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations the following sections address in more detail the specific procedures measures and analyses of the major categories of risk this discussion of managing risk focuses on the current risk framework that as part of its annual review process was approved by the erc and the board as set forth in our risk framework a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to our values and our purpose and how we drive responsible growth it requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promote sound risktaking within our risk appetite sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to the success of the corporation and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the board our risk framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the corporation the risk framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the board through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities executive management assesses with board oversight the riskadjusted returns of each business management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans as well as the capital plan and risk appetite statement and recommends them annually to the board for approval our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite management sets financial objectives for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business capital allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve for more information regarding capital allocations see business segment operations on page the corporations risk appetite indicates the amount of capital earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans consistent with applicable regulatory requirements our risk appetite provides a common framework that includes a set of measures to assist senior management and the board in assessing the corporations risk profile against our risk appetite and risk capacity our risk appetite is formally articulated in the risk appetite statement which includes both qualitative statements and quantitative limits our overall capacity to take risk is limited therefore we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities therefore we set objectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner at all times including during periods of stress our lines of business operate with risk limits that align with the corporations risk appetite senior management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to risk appetite limits the board and its committees when appropriate oversee financial performance execution of the strategic and financial operating plans adherence to risk appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls for a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities see the discussion below and pages through risk management governance the risk framework describes delegations of authority whereby the board and its committees may delegate authority to managementlevel committees or executive officers such delegations may authorize certain decisionmaking and approval functions which may be evidenced in documents such as committee charters job descriptions meeting minutes and resolutions the chart below illustrates the interrelationship among the board board committees and management committees that have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the corporation table start bank of america table end board of directors and board committees the board is composed of directors all but one of whom are independent the board authorizes management to maintain an effective risk framework and oversees compliance with safe and sound banking practices in addition the board or its committees conduct

risk framework requires that strong risk management practices are integrated in key strategic capital and financial planning processes and in daytoday business processes across the corporation thereby ensuring risks are appropriately considered evaluated and responded to in a timely manner we employ an effective risk management process referred to as identify measure monitor and control as part of our daily activities identify to be effectively managed risks must be proactively identified and well understood proper risk identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in our business activities or key risks that may arise from external factors each employee is expected to identify and escalate risks promptly risk identification is an ongoing process that incorporates input from flus and control functions it is designed to be forwardlooking and to capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business measure once a risk is identified it must be prioritized and accurately measured through a systematic process including qualitative statements and quantitative limits risk is measured at various levels including but not limited to risk type flu and legal entity and also on an aggregate basis this risk measurement process helps to capture changes in our risk profile due to changes in strategic direction concentrations portfolio quality and the overall economic environment senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios monitor we monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk appetite policies and standards we also regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures through our monitoring we know our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a

management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements including payments under longterm debt agreements commitments to extend credit and customer deposit withdrawals while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions to achieve that objective we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base and seek to align liquidityrelated incentives and risks these liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage the market fluctuation from the rising interest rate environment inflationary pressures and macroeconomic environment we define liquidity as readily available assets limited to cash and highquality liquid unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise we manage our liquidity position through lineofbusiness and alm activities as well as through our legal entity funding strategy on both a forward and current table start bank of america table end including intraday basis under both expected and stressed conditions we believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements maximizes access to funding sources minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events the board approves our liquidity risk policy and the financial contingency and recovery plan the erc establishes our liquidity risk tolerance levels the mrc is responsible for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures within the established tolerance levels the mrc reviews and monitors our liquidity position and stress testing results approves certain liquidity risk limits and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity for more information see managing risk on page under this governance framework we developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include maintaining liquidity at bank of america corporation parent and selected subsidiaries including our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions diversifying funding sources considering our asset profile and legal entity structure and performing contingency planning nb holdings corporation the parent which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries has an intercompany arrangement with our whollyowned holding company subsidiary nb holdings corporation nb holdings we have transferred and agreed to transfer additional parent assets not required to satisfy anticipated nearterm expenditures to nb holdings the parent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets these arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy under which only the parent would be resolved under the us bankruptcy code in consideration for the transfer of assets nb holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets the aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers nb holdings also provided the parent with a committed line of credit that allows the parent to draw funds necessary to service nearterm cash needs these arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy under which only the parent would be resolved under the us bankruptcy code these arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit forgive the subordinated note and require the parent to transfer its remaining financial assets to nb holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the parent becomes imminent global liquidity sources and other unencumbered assets we maintain liquidity available to the corporation including the parent and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and highquality liquid unencumbered securities our liquidity buffer referred to as global liquidity sources gls is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent and selected subsidiaries including holding company bank and brokerdealer subsidiaries even during stressed market conditions our cash is primarily on deposit with the federal reserve bank and to a lesser extent central banks outside of the us we limit the composition of highquality liquid unencumbered securities to us government securities us agency securities us agency mbs and other investmentgrade securities and a select group of nonus government securities we can obtain cash for these securities even in stressed conditions through repurchase agreements or outright sales we hold our gls in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses and we consider the

of significant liquidity stress expressed as a percentage our average consolidated hqla on a net basis was billion and billion for the three months ended december and for the same periods the average consolidated lcr was percent and percent our lcr fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity liquidity stress analysis we utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios the scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate marketwide and corporationspecific events including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent and our subsidiaries and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios the scenarios are based on our historical experience experience of distressed and failed financial institutions regulatory guidance and both expected and unexpected future events the types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include but are not limited to upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuances diminished access to secured financing markets potential deposit withdrawals increased draws on loan commitments liquidity facilities and letters of credit additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities changes in certain market factors including but not limited to credit rating downgrades could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results we consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity we also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses net stable funding ratio the net stable funding ratio nsfr is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a oneyear period the requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the lcr which focuses on shortterm liquidity risks the us nsfr applies to the corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions at december the corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with this requirement diversified funding sources we fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products programs markets currencies and investor groups the primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control reduced funding costs wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries where regulations time zone differences or other business considerations make parent funding impractical certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt we fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits which were trillion and trillion at december and deposits are primarily generated by our consumer banking gwim and global banking segments these deposits are diversified by clients product type and geography and the majority of our us deposits are insured by the fdic we consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable lowcost and consistent source of funding we believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings including credit card securitizations and securitizations with governmentsponsored enterprises gse the federal housing administration fha and privatelabel investors as well as fhlb loans our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions we believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more costefficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing repurchase agreements are generally shortterm and often overnight disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing we manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations when appropriate for more information on secured financing agreements see note securities financing agreements

thereafter we issue longterm unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve costefficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile while the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the corporation we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter we may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes certain of which qualify as tlaceligible debt during we issued billion of structured notes which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities indices currencies or commodities we typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives andor investments in the underlying instruments so that from a funding perspective the cost is similar to our other unsecured longterm debt we could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances which we consider for liquidity planning purposes we believe however that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date substantially all of our senior and

market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations primarily within our global markets segment we are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the corporation eg our alm activities in the event of market stress these risks could have a material impact on our results for more information see interest rate risk management for the banking book on page our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities historical cost however these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates the risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our alm activities we have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income trading positions are subject to various changes in marketbased risk factors the majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate foreign exchange credit equity and commodities markets in addition the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility we seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments the key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the trading risk management section grm is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed these responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy developing and maintaining quantitative risk models calculating aggregated risk measures establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements market risks that impact businesses outside of global markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports given that models are used across the corporation model risk impacts all risk types including credit market and operational risks the enterprise model risk policy defines model risk standards consistent with our risk framework and risk appetite prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice all models including risk management valuation and regulatory capital models must meet certain validation criteria including effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the model independent model testing and ongoing monitoring through outcomes analysis and benchmarking the enterprise model risk committee a subcommittee of the mrc oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the corporation interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates these instruments include but are not limited to loans debt securities certain tradingrelated assets and liabilities deposits borrowings and derivatives hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options futures forwards and swaps foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in nonus subsidiaries foreign currencydenominated loans and securities future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions foreign currencydenominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or nonus interest rates hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options currency swaps futures forwards and foreign currencydenominated debt and deposits mortgage risk mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgagerelated instruments the values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates mortgage rates agency debt ratings default market liquidity government participation and interest rate volatility our exposure to these instruments takes several forms for example we trade and engage in marketmaking activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans passthrough certificates commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral in addition we originate a variety of mbs which involves the accumulation of mortgagerelated loans in anticipation of eventual securitization and we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the alm portfolio we also record msrs as part of our mortgage origination activities hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include derivatives such as options swaps futures and forwards as well as securities including mbs and us treasury securities for more information see mortgage banking risk management on page equity market

and calls otc equity options equity total return swaps equity index futures and other equity derivative products hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options futures swaps convertible bonds and cash positions commodity risk commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum natural gas power and metals markets these instruments consist primarily of futures forwards swaps and options hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product as well as cash positions table start bank of america table end issuer credit risk issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads by credit migration or by defaults hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds cds and other credit fixedincome instruments market liquidity risk market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and in certain cases may even cease this exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results this impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments we utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in trading risk management trading risk management to evaluate risks in our trading activities we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the corporation these measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves such as var and stress testing periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations additionally risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments var is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors including the effects of portfolio diversification a var model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses var represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period based on a specified holding period confidence level and window of historical data we use one var model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a threeyear window of historical data our primary var statistic is equivalent to a percent confidence level which means that for a var with a oneday holding period there should not be losses in excess of var on average out of trading days within any var model there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company the accuracy of a var model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio a var model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available for positions with insufficient historical data for the var calculation the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position this analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience var may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results in particular the historical data used for the var calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced in order for the var model to reflect current market conditions we update the historical data underlying our var model on a weekly basis or more frequently during periods of market stress and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model a minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in var these risks are reviewed as part of our icaap for more information regarding icaap see capital management on page grm continually reviews evaluates and enhances our var model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio changes to the var model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees trading limits on quantitative risk measures including var are independently set by global markets risk management and reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity volatility and strategic business priorities trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors all trading limits are approved at least annually approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the corporations risk appetite statement these risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the erc and the board in periods of market stress global markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses key risk positions and any limit excesses as a result of this process the businesses may selectively reduce risk table presents the total marketbased portfolio var which is the combination of the total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio and the fair value option portfolio covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities both on and offbalance sheet that meet a defined set of specifications these specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a shortterm horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a twoway market positions in less liquid markets or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions typically do not qualify as covered positions foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval in addition table presents our fair value option portfolio which includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option and their corresponding hedges additionally market risk var for trading activities as presented in table differs from var used for regulatory capital calculations due to

portfolio portfolio diversification total marketbased portfolio table end backtesting the accuracy of the var methodology is evaluated by backtesting which compares the daily var results utilizing a oneday holding period against a comparable subset of trading revenue a backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the var for the corresponding day these excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to help confirm that the var methodology accurately represents those losses we expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of var to be in line with the confidence level of the var statistic being tested for example with a percent confidence level we expect one trading loss in excess of var every days or between two to three trading losses in excess of var over the course of a year the number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the var calculation the trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the var component of the regulatory capital calculation this revenue differs from total tradingrelated revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in var some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading revenues we conduct daily backtesting on the var results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the var results for key legal entities regions and risk factors these results are reported to senior market risk management senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests during there was one day where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio var utilizing a oneday holding period total tradingrelated revenue total tradingrelated revenue excluding brokerage fees and cva dva and funding valuation adjustment gains losses represents the total amount earned from trading positions including marketbased net interest income which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets for more information on fair value see note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements tradingrelated revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand also tradingrelated revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions the level of risk assumed and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the everchanging market environment significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed the following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of tradingrelated revenue for and during positive tradingrelated revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days of which percent were daily trading gains of over million and the largest loss was million this compares to where positive tradingrelated revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days of which percent were daily trading gains of over million and the largest loss was million trading portfolio stress testing because the very nature of a var model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis this analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements a set of scenarios categorized as either historical or hypothetical are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses these scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate var table start bank of america table end historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress generally a multiweek period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information in addition new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio the stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprisewide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework the macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprisewide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning for more information see managing risk on page interest rate risk management for the banking book the following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates clientfacing activities primarily lending and deposittaking create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet we prepare forwardlooking forecasts of net interest income the baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth alm positioning and the future direction of interest rate movements as implied by marketbased forward curves we then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions the net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends market conditions and business strategies thus we continually monitor our banking book balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes the interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing changes in funding mix product repricing maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital table presents the spot and 12month

interest rate scenarios also assume us dollar interest rates are floored at zero depending on the level of interest rates downrate scenarios may not receive the full impact of the rate shock particularly in low rate environments the overall decrease in asset sensitivity as shown in the following table to uprate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in longend and shortend rates we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated oci and thus capital levels under the basel capital rules under instantaneous upward parallel shifts the nearterm adverse impact to basel capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from the banking book activities for more

does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates as part of our alm activities we use securities certain residential mortgages and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity the behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the sensitivity analysis in table assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts we use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our alm activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks specifically we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks our interest rate derivative contracts are generally nonleveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps options futures and forwards and our foreign exchange contracts include crosscurrency interest rate swaps foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency forward contracts and options the derivatives used in our alm activities can be split into two broad categories designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the interest rate risk management for the banking book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in table the corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations by hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations the corporations market risk exposure in this area is not significant risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the corporations nontrading foreign currencydenominated financial instruments these foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as crosscurrency basis spreads and interest rate risk however as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives the market risk related to this exposure is not significant for more information on the accounting for derivatives see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements mortgage banking risk management we originate fund and service mortgage loans which subject us to credit liquidity and interest rate risks among others we determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations changes in interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock commitments irlcs and the related residential first mortgage lhfs between the date of the irlc and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market an increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments conversely when there is an increase in interest rates the value of the msrs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations because the interest rate risks of these hedged items

technology and market changes these changes and events may have broad impacts on operations supply chains distribution networks customers and markets and are otherwise referred to respectively as physical risk and transition risk these risks may impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types physical risk may lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral physical risk may also increase operational risk by impacting the corporations facilities employees customers or vendors transition risks may amplify credit risk through the financial impacts of changes in policy technology or the market on the corporation or its counterparties unanticipated market changes can lead to sudden price adjustments and give rise to heightened market risk in addition reputational risk may arise including from our climaterelated practices and disclosures and if we do not meet our climaterelated commitments effective management of climate risk requires coordinated governance clearly defined roles and responsibilities and well table start bank of america table end developed processes to identify measure monitor and control risks as climate risk spans all key risk types we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk framework and risk management programs established for strategic credit market liquidity compliance operational and reputational risks our environmental and social risk policy framework aligns with our risk framework and provides additional clarity and transparency regarding our approach to environmental and social risks inclusive of climate risk our governance framework establishes oversight of climate risk practices and strategies by the board supported by its erc as well as the mrc and the responsible growth committee both of which are managementlevel committees comprised of senior leaders across every major flu and control function the responsible growth committee is supported by the esg disclosure subcommittee which is responsible for reviewing and providing oversight of the corporations climate and esgrelated public disclosures our climate risk management efforts are overseen by an executive officer who reports to the cro the climate risk council which consists of leaders across risk flu and control functions meets routinely to discuss our approach to managing climaterelated risks in line with our risk framework in we publicly announced our commitment to achieve net zero emissions in our financing activities operations and supply chain before net zero goal and set emissions targets for our operations and supply chain in connection with our net zero goal in we announced a target to reduce emissions by associated with our financing activities related to auto manufacturing energy and power generation targets in our september task force on climaterelated financial disclosures report we disclosed our and financed emissions and emissions intensity metrics for these sectors with serving as the baseline for our targets we plan to disclose the financed emissions for additional portions of our business loan portfolio in and we plan to set financing activity emission reduction targets for other key sectors by april achieving our climaterelated goals and targets including our net zero goal and targets may require technological advances clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors new standards and public policies including those that improve the cost of capital for the transition to a lowcarbon economy and better emissions data reporting as well as ongoing strong and active engagement with customers suppliers investors government officials and other stakeholders given the extended period of

goals and commitments with respect to climate risk management including environmental transition considerations include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve certain known and unknown risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond the corporations control actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any of these forwardlooking statements complex accounting estimates our significant accounting principles as described in note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements are essential in understanding the mda many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities we have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments the more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion we have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates in many cases there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models where alternatives exist we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our results of operations separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables the value of our lending portfolio and marketsensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date often significantly due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant negative effect on future operating results these fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in note summary of significant accounting principles and note outstanding loans and leases and allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements the determination of the allowance for credit losses is based on numerous estimates and assumptions which require table start bank of america table end a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated a critical judgment in the process is the weighting of our forwardlooking macroeconomic scenarios that are incorporated into our quantitative models as any one economic outlook is inherently uncertain the corporation uses multiple macroeconomic scenarios in its ecl calculation which have included a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession a downside scenario reflecting persistent inflation and interest rates above the baseline scenario a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario the overall economic outlook is weighted percent towards a recessionary environment in with continued inflationary pressures leading to lower gross domestic product gdp and higher unemployment rate expectations as compared to the prior year generally as the consensus estimates improve or deteriorate the allowance for credit losses will change in a similar direction there are multiple variables that drive the macroeconomic scenarios with the key variables including but not limited to us gdp and unemployment rates as of december the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the us average unemployment rate was forecasted at percent percent and percent in the fourth quarters of and respectively and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for us gdp was forecasted to grow at percent percent and percent yearoveryear in the fourth quarters of and respectively as of december the latest consensus estimates for the us average unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of was percent and us gdp was forecasted to grow percent yearoveryear in the fourth quarter of reflecting a tighter labor market and depressed growth expectations compared to our macroeconomic outlook as of december and were factored into our allowance for credit losses estimate as of december in addition as of december the weighted macroeconomic outlook for the us average unemployment rate was forecasted at percent and percent in the fourth quarters of and and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for us gdp was forecasted to contract percent and grow percent yearoveryear in the fourth quarters of and in addition to the above judgments and estimates the allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio such as increases or decreases in credit andor internal risk ratings in our commercial portfolio improvement or deterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card portfolio and increases or decreases in home prices which is a primary driver of ltvs in our consumer real estate portfolio all of which have some degree of uncertainty the allowance for credit losses increased to billion from billion at december primarily due to loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook in to provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the macroeconomic scenarios and other assumptions on the estimate of our allowance for credit losses the corporation compared the december modeled ecl from the baseline scenario and our adverse scenario relative to the baseline scenario the adverse scenario assumed a peak us unemployment rate of nearly three percentage points higher than the baseline scenario a decline in us gdp followed by a prolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook with a difference of approximately eight percent at the trough this sensitivity analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately billion while the sensitivity analysis may be useful to understand how changes in macroeconomic assumptions could impact our modeled ecls it is not meant to forecast how our allowance for credit losses is expected to change in a different macroeconomic outlook importantly the analysis does not incorporate a variety of factors including qualitative reserves and the weighting of alternate scenarios which could have offsetting effects on the estimate considering the variety of factors contemplated when developing and weighting macroeconomic outlooks such as recent economic events leading economic indicators views of internal and thirdparty economists and industry trends in addition to other qualitative factors the corporation believes the allowance for credit losses at december is appropriate fair value of financial instruments under applicable accounting standards we are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value we classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and msrs based on the threelevel fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards the fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments such as market liquidity and credit quality where appropriate valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs where market data is available the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity in periods of extreme volatility lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process in keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities we have in place various processes and controls that include a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products primarily through validation controls we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both marketobservable and internallymodeled values andor valuation inputs our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker andor pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling for example broker quotes in less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable these processes and controls are performed independently of the business for more information see note fair value measurements and note fair value option to the consolidated financial statements level assets and liabilities financial assets and liabilities and msrs where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as level under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting standards the fair value of these level financial assets and liabilities and table start bank of america table end msrs is determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation level financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as level or therefore gains or losses associated with level financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy the level gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital we conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis transfers into or out of level are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable respectively in the current marketplace for more information on transfers into and out of level during and see note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements accrued income taxes and deferred tax assets accrued income taxes reported as a component of either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date we currently file income tax returns in more than jurisdictions and consider many factors including statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction net deferred tax assets reported as a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheet represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss nol and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements nol and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods we consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized consistent with the applicable accounting guidance we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes andor net deferred tax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities these revisions of our estimates which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters may be material to our operating results for any given period see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information for more
